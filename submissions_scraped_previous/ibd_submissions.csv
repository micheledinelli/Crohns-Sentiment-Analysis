But with the coronoavirus going around, I was wondering if you all had any input from your doctors about traveling at this time. I personally don’t think it’s too big of a deal as long as I make sure to wash my hands and not touch my face, but my family is getting nervous haha.",2020-03-01 21:24:28

2,How long did it take for you to get diagnosed from the time you suspected till your G.I. confirmed?,darknesskiss,6,fbtjvx,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/fbtjvx/how_long_did_it_take_for_you_to_get_diagnosed/,21,"Sorry for the novel but I'm frustrated and suffering and I feel like when I bring up things I'm dismissed or left feeling worst. 30 year old female in AB, Canada and I'm prediagnosed waiting on a colonoscopy on the March 12th. That was the earliest they could get me in after Jan 31st when my sigmoidocopy biopsys was inconclusive. 
Symptoms for 10+ year but found a new family Dr in October who listened. She thought by my stomech exzema(diagnosed at 10) I was celiac. The blood work came back negative but she still wanted me off the gluten to see if it helps with my Eczema. 
I was feeling good for about a month and then everything came crashing down.  She had put me on short course dapsone orally and that seemed to somewhat help my stomach rash.  Anything I've ever taken for my Eczema and never fully goes away and it only breaks out on my stomach and usually on my right side. I usually just self-managed with really good moisturizer and avoiding  anything with scents but no matter what I do it just flares up. When I was a child had severe lactose intolerance which decreased as I got older so I though sometimes I chopped up my symptoms as I didn't avoid as much as I should. 
After a month or so back and forth I went back to my doctor she still wanted me off gluten but did refer me to a GI. From what I understand the regular wait-listed in Alberta right now is at least a year out. I have just graduated school and I was having trouble finding a job or having any energy to work. Partly because of symtoms/fatigue on top of not a great job market. At the end of Jan blood started.  Years of symptoms, so blood was not uncommon but I've never had it more than a few days. I assumed in the past it was hemorrhoids. After week I've on the would like nope this can't be good and went off to a emerge. They got me in for an sigmoidoscopy the next day so the 31st. They mentioned mild patchy inflammation and took some biopsies sent me home with a Pentasa suppository.
I waited about five days of taking the medication still wasn't stopping any blood or feeling very good I called his office and I think that was my first mistake. He told me to give the medication a longer try and didn't really want to talk to me. I get it they're busy. I gave them another week and I didn't hear anything so I called again but I feel like I was already labelled a ""problem"" case. I didn't get to talk to anyone and the girl at his office told me she's been meaning to call me at the results were inconclusive and they have to book me for a colonoscopy .I still had no energy obviously now it's been 3 weeks of bleeding. 
My Dr hadn't heard anything either when I went to her but put me on iron pills after some more blood work. I probably was a little extra anemic from being on my menstrual cycle at the time.  After a week on the iron pills I had more energy and I was feeling improvement in fatigue and energy. Though it had been causing a little bit more strain when going to the bathroom so when I called my the GI office I just brought that up and asked if they had any other suggestions they told me to get off the iron, I disagreed because it was making me be able to live life but I listened to them and as soon as I was off it I saw the most blood ever. I was ""good"" until this week on Wednesday. I was out and about and doing some shopping and had blood without a bowel movement leakage. My mother convinced me to go back to emerge.
I felt like the emerge doctor was taking everything serious and told me he was going to talk to the GI and they have to make a plan tonight. He had a phone consult with a different GI in the same Hospital.. Now keep in mind I haven't had anything to eat for over 24 hours because once I'm at emerge they told me don't eat anything and don't worry about prep for the sigmoidoscopy.
So I'm pretty tired I didn't sleep very well so going into the second sigmoidoscopy I probably wasn't in the best mood and I accept that I can be difficult. They talked about possible treatments. They went up there said that everything was under control they didn't know what was causing the bleeding other than there was one submucosa legion they took another biopsy of that. In the meantime my original GI came in and they talk back and forth.
They pointed out that I did have a hemorrhoid close to and it was looking very inflamed. So that's probably where the extra blood come from. I say ""extra"" blood because despite what they say I don't think the bleeding is just from that. I feel like they were both talking to me like I was silly and had wasted their time. They told me to go get some Benefiber and to stop taking the pantesa every night and switch to every other. I brought up concerns and felt like they just were acting like I was hysterical or stopped listening. 
As you can imagine I was just tired and wanted to go home and felt like I'd wasted my time. I guess the nurse said something about the change in my mood because I was just waiting for the paperwork and his instructions so I could leave but he's felt the need to come over and talk to me. At this point I was just done because he kept talking about the Hemorrhoid like I didn't understand what it was or I didn't know how much they can actually bleed. At that point I lost my temper and said if it was just blood I wouldn't be worried about it it's everything else that you don't seem to want to listen to. He went on and lectured me about patience and waiting cuz this is the way the system works in Canada and if I don't like it write to MLA.
I left feeling so disgusted and ashamed that somebody that is dealing with patients that are suffering everyday obviously has no compassion or bedside manner. I'm not an idiot it's probably because the Alberta Government has cut spending and he's probably feeling the Crunch and his patients but you should never put your frustration on your patients. I know how the system works I grew up in a bad side of town where I didn't get the help I needed half the time so I don't have a lot of faith in the system to begin with.  
At this point I really don't even want to go back but I know that's ridiculous attitude so I will go back for the colonoscopy on the 12th and then I might be looking for different doctors. I'm pretty sure the Benefibre has just made me super bloated and now that I take the pentasa every other night the nights I'm back to sleeping a lot less. He said that the Benefiber will help with the diarrhea. That's when I really got upset because I had never talked about diarrhea because I haven't had diarrhea yeah I run to the bathroom but obviously they haven't listened to a thing I've said but how would they listen to a thing I said I haven't actually gotten to talk to a doctor I've just gotten third party people either his receptionist or the emerge. 
I've been having intermittent or low-grade fevers
Nausea and no appetite
Very soft stools (pre iron and after off)
Fatigue and brain fog
Lower back pain ( pain is not necessarily the word I just can feel the nerve there and it gets hot)
Joint pain mostly on my left side ( still have it on my right side but I'd say it's probably like a quarter of what my left side is)
For the last 3 months my menstrual cycle has been about 3 days which is very abnormal for me.
I know some of the stuff can be stress and anxiety and I was getting pretty stressed at the end of school and I get that some of the stuff is mental and I'm trying to keep a positive attitude and I've been trying to change my outlook on life. I was using cannabis to combat some of my symptoms but I've been using it for over a year at bedtime to sleep and I was worried I was getting to the point I was reaching for it more and more during the day. I don't want to be over dependent on it because I still have to work I found something casual part-time like 10 to 15 hours a week but even that is so exhausting and I'm only working 5 hour shift. So I've been free of everything for a week. I think I will choose to not take any pain killers or cannabis until after the 12th so that they don't get mixer results because I know that the Cannabis has been helping with some of the inflammation. And I know that some people can get nausea and stuff on the Cannabis so I wanted to make sure for my peace of mind that I wasn't causing more problems.
I know it's about waiting and being patient and everybody goes through kind of the same things but I just feel like the system is broken and I'm getting more worried that I've seen more and more cases of younger people getting bowel cancer and people just ignoring it because they were too young. Oh The only positive thing I can say about cutting gluten out of my life is I used to get chronic migraines and I haven't had a migraine in a few months. I was actually a vegetarian for 5 years but after my spouse I ended up switching back to meat about a year ago. I don't know maybe I'm just broken and I'll never get answers",2020-03-01 13:44:23

4,Would love tips for my colonoscopy,RaeNezL,5,fd2540,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/fd2540/would_love_tips_for_my_colonoscopy/,23,"Hi all! So I finally got to the GI today and, as expected, he wants to do a colonoscopy. I’ve got that scheduled for next Tuesday. (Yay - but not.) 

This office does SuPrep, and the last time I did a prep it was one of those giant gallon jugs of prep (can’t remember which one exactly) that had a lovely fishy aftertaste. I couldn’t finish it all because I was so grossed out. So if anyone can tell me how bad SuPrep is, that would be great. I know my mom has done it before and vomited all over the place from it. Super excited if that’s my fate... /s 

So please give me your best tips and tricks for surviving the prep! Do you change up your diet in the days leading up? Should I eat lighter over the weekend and add in some Miralax/Dulcolax just in case the prep makes me sick? 

What things should I have on hand to survive the prep? Last time I did Sprite and jello and similarly clear things. Plus coffee because I can’t without coffee. (It’s just nice that I already drink my coffee black.) 

Interestingly my GI has instructions on the back here in case my insurance doesn’t cover SuPrep, and those instructions are for a Miralax/Dulcolax/Milk of Magnesia split. Part of me wants to just skip the prep and do that instead, but I’m afraid it wouldn’t work as well for me. 

I just would love some tips and tricks to survive this time around. And if you could tell me if the SuPrep is gonna be fishy, that would at least help me prepare mentally. 

Thanks everyone!",2020-03-03 22:47:24

Prior to the Humira, I was on a 40mg dose of Predisone and then began to taper off more rapidly.  I did my initial 4 shots on the 14th, then two weeks later I did the follow up 2 shots all while decreasing my Predisone dose every 5 days.  I’m now on 15mg of Predisone currently and will be completely off of it within the next two weeks, and I have my 3rd dose of Humira next Friday.  My question is, is it normal for my stools to become more bloody as I taper off the Predisone?  Or should the Humira have already kicked in?  I’ve noticed my bowel movements are not as frequent as they were during the worst part of the flair, but they are not as good as when I was on both Humira and the Predisone (around 30mg).  Should I give it more time for the Humira to kick in and fully get off the steroid or is this a sign that Humira isn’t going to work for me?

25,Double bowel resection. Brutal.,DebLouE,11,fgafr9,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/fgafr9/double_bowel_resection_brutal/,31,"Strap in as this is going to be long and brutal and probably not something you want to read or see if you are eating!

As the title says, I've just had a double bowel resection surgery.

I've battled Crohns disease now for approximately 10 years. At the time I struggled massively to get an actual diagnosis because every colonoscopy I had showed absolutely nothing. I had at least 3 upper and lower scopes done and all that was ever found was an ulcer which had ruptured in my stomach. I lost a lot of blood that time and needed to be transfused with 5 pints (units) of blood.  I was living in England at the time and spent almost that entire time going in and out of hospital, being told that my symptoms were being caused by endometriosis. Everyone refused to investigate further and eventually I left England and headed back home to Scotland to help care for my sick dad. (Whole other story, obviously)

Things sort of settled on and off. Until I started suffering more and more pain. I rarely had the most common symptom of crohns which is the diarrhoea. Instead I was having blockage after blockage in my bowel. Specifically my small bowel. I was passed to a decent GI here in Scotland and they did a whole raft of new tests. MRI scans, CT scans, Xrays, blood tests and fecal cal protectin tests. EVERYTHING was pointing to crohns of the small bowel. 

Now there were things happening in the background that I had literally no idea about. I seemed to be forgotten about for almost 2 years. Waiting to see a GI, in and out of hospital because my body was so malnourished I almost died of starvation. I ended up with refeeding syndrome after the last particularly bad one. But it was always the same treatment, ""your scan shows narrowing of the small bowel, we think its crohns but not sure. You need to take these laxatives and pain medication and have a follow up in clinic"".

Needless to say, I've spent the last year popping pain medication like smarties. Just to be able to get out of bed in the morning. The last year in particular has just gone from worse to worse though. I got a confirmation letter from some specialists in Glasgow saying that they didnt feel comfortable giving me a camera pill test and that they were confident it was crohns from all the evidence they have.

I almost jumped with joy. Things moved quickly, I did weeks and weeks of steroids and then put onto azothiaprine. I got 5 weeks into the azo and had a very rare and nasty allergic reaction to it and it started to destroy my lungs. Basically my caused fibrosis in my lungs. Now I knew it wasnt going to be straight forward so I kept going. The relief i had when they said they would start me on adalimumab, was palpable. I was excited, I'd heard great things about this drug.


*warning gross content ahead*

6 weeks into adalimumab, and I start to get VERY VERY ill. I thought it was just going to be a usual thing, take a load of laxatives and I'll be ok in a couple of days. But no. I started to vomit. But it was faecal vomiting I was having. It didn't matter what I ate or drank, it came out. 

I put off going to a&e because I was just so sick and tired of being made to feel like what I was telling them was being ignored. The amount of times I was made to feel like my pain was in my head and even though they never said it, they made me feel like I was drug seeking. Every. Single. Time.

Eventually after passing out, I took myself in to a&e. They did an emergency CT and said that it looked like I had and I quote ""2 or 3"" strictures in my small bowel. They decided to treat me for 5 days in hospital on IV steroids and antibiotics. I went further and further down hill. 

I had to BEG for an NG tube! Literally BEG for one to relieve the pain and pressure of my bowels emptying into my stomach. The nurse took almost 2 hours to come and fit it and she had an an attitude the entire time.

Needless to say, when the suction was attached and everything came pouring out the tube, her attitude changed considerably! 

The colorectal surgeon came round and told me they would operate in the morning. He said that he thought it would be a case of just going in keyhole and sorting out this couple of strictures and I'll be sorted.


It's funny how you just know your body though, isn't it? I called my partner and my mum and told them that I think they're going to get a shock when they go in.

When I came round for surgery, no one would tell me what had been done. They kept telling me that the surgeon needed to explain it and that things weren't as straightforward as they hoped.

The surgeon came round once my pain was under control in recovery. He said that he had went in laprascopically but soon discovered that almost my entire small bowel was completely destroyed.  The 3 or 4 strictures,  max that they thought were there turned out to be at least 22. NO I didn't stutter, literally twenty two. 

His exact words were that almost my entire small bowel was completely fused shut. He didn't know how I was alive. In all, they removed around 3.5 meters of small bowel. They managed to save a tiny enough bit to do a midsection resection and a small bowel resection. But it was only JUST. If anything goes wrong with this, I have nothing left.

He said normally people would end up with a bag (even though normally people don't have +20 of those things inside them). But fingers crossed I don't have to have that in future.

That man saved my life. But I'm so angry. They knew from my original CT that my bowel was a mess and not a single person actually helped me.

All of this has cost me my home, my friends, my family relationships, my romantic relationships, my job, my hobbies, my car, and of course my health.

I think its safe to say, I'm considering taking this to court.

46,Normal without Amitriptyline,goobermouth,5,flu8bk,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/flu8bk/normal_without_amitriptyline/,3,"Back to normal without amitripyline

Last summer I got really bad stomach problems that GI doctor could not figure out. I got a colonoscopy and endoscopy and still couldn’t understand why I was having terrible stomach problems, along with other tests. My doctor basically gave up and admitted she didn’t know what’s wrong and just blamed it on stress (typical). She prescribed me a very low dose of amitriptyline.... leaving me to deal with it alone and try to get into the Mayo Clinic that’s 3hrs away from me.

I dramatically changed my diet and it’s helped a lot while taking amitriptyline. I realized I’m very sensitive to all dairy. My stomach was almost back to normal except I was VERY gassy and plugged up. I’d be constipated for days then all of a sudden be in the bathroom dumping it all out. It felt like my stomach was hurting because of trapped gas. I still had frequent stomach problems (just not as bad) but it wasn’t like before. I just assumed it was my stomach still having problems and nothing to do with the medicine. Amitriptyline helped with my mood and sleep. So I liked taking it. 

Anyways, I stopped seeing the GI doctor since she wasn’t much help so my prescription ran out eventually. I didn’t want to get it refilled. I slowly got off amitriptyline and it was awful for a week. I felt fatigue and my stomach was hurting more... I didn’t have much of an appetite and honestly just felt sick. 2 months later, I feel great. No more stomach problems. No trapped gas and no constipation. I really believe amitriptyline was apart of all my stomach problems. It’s frustrating that all GI doctors want to do is prescribe medicine without solving the problem. The doctor has prescribed 3 different types of medicines before amitriptyline and they made my symptoms even worse. 

Just wanted to share my story. Maybe amitriptyline is a part of the problem for you and you’ll feel better without it... or maybe not.",2020-03-20 13:30:54

I got damaged bowel, 6 cm without haustri as shown on mri enterography, that insinuates IBD. I had gotten it after a fight with cdiff 5months ago. I cured it with one round of vanco but my troubles just started. I had very aggressive diahrrea up to 16x times a day after that, and it always was negative on cdiff ( i went to er) few times. Negative on bacteria, parasites, viruses. I am on Boulardi (btw should I be also on some other probiotics or is it too much?)
And anyway, i tested for blood in stool since I saw it few times, came back negative, I took 3 samples. 😕
Also tested for. H. Plylori, came back negative. My problems are awfull cramps, PAINFUL gas, all the time no matter what I eat. My stomach is always full of air growling, passing painful gas and especially in the morning, and then I go to pass the stool, which is normal last 40 days. I haven't had diahrrea in a month.
My question is.. Do any of you take digestive enzymes, and do they help? Can they cause diahrrea as a side effect, cause I seriously can't take it anymore.. I am desperate. I am in deep anorexia cause everything hurts, I tried lactose free, same shit. I tried gluten free, same shit... So its not generally lactose or gluten it's food and my stomach reacting to it... So can digestive enzymes help? Please, somebody.I am desperate. They think I have colitis (especially caus after cdiff it's common to develop colitis).
I also have gerb, hiatal hernia, endometriosis(still questioned , I had to have laparoscopy but since this corona virus I can't). I have addison's so my immunity is non existant so to say. Hashimoto and adhesions in my stomach... Please I really am desperate for anything that can help since pills for cramps like spasmex and buscopan are of little to no help",2020-03-23 08:46:42

First, some background. I'm a 36 year old, otherwise healthy male. I eat a healthy diet and exercise 4-5 days a week. I first developed symptoms of IBD around seven months ago. My symptoms began with rectal discomfort, fullness, pain with BMs. That turned into a week of projectile diarrhea with a lot of gas.  That finally got better and my stools became normal again but then I started seeing blood in my stool on a daily basis. I went to my PCP, she did an exam and chalked it all up to hemmorhoids or a fissure even though she didn't feel either on exam. She told me to use Prep. H and Sitz baths. Using the Prep H suppositories was agony so I only did that once. I then had an episode where I became really sick with a fever to 104, profuse mucoid diarrhea, nausea but no vomiting, and a severe headache. That got better after a day, but I still had diarrhea for a week afterwards. The bleeding continued throughout. Finally, two months ago, I had a colonoscopy which showed apthous ulcerations in every segment of my colon, but no ileal involvement. I've had no weight loss, fatigue, or other systemic signs outside of flares. My GI couldn't say if it was Crohn's or UC, but he started me on messaline 2.4gm per day, which didn't seem to do anything for the bleeding.  He told me if after two months, it wasn't helping, to stop. I also started reading up and it seems that doing a work up for infectious causes is standard, so I asked him and he ordered 3 stool cultures for ova and parasites. Two of the three showed entamoebi coli, which he said was not the cause of my symptoms. I talked to a friend of mine who works in infectious disease and she recommended treating it anyways, so I took three days of tinadazole, which I don't think helped. 

So last week on Wednesday, I felt a little constipated, but I didn't think much of it. The next day (Thursday) was two months from starting the mesalamine and I stopped it, per my GI's advice, since it didn't seem to be helping. The next day (Friday), the constipation evolved into rectal fullness and discomfort. I also left for California for vacation. The next day (Saturday), I had symptoms but didn't let them interfere with my activities. They interfered a bit with my sleep, but otherwise I was ok. I did notice some skin redness and tenderness on my buttocks and rectum. I'm pretty hairy down there so I have had issues with skin irritation from hair and sweat where my buttocks and thighs touch before. It also seems that a lot of thin mucus leaks out during a flare since it's always wet down there. But since this occurred in the context of a flare, it made me worried about an abscess or skin infection. I went to urgent Care and had an exam. They didn't feel an abscess and just attributed it to the IBD. They gave me a refill of the mesalamine, which I restarted at 4.8 gm this time. The rectal pain and fullness have improved, but I still have the skin irritation. Keeping it dry seems to help. Other than losing sleep, I've felt otherwise well, no abdominal discomfort or fatigue. 

Has anyone ever experienced anything similar with the skin irritation? Any recommendations? Is this common? I haven't had diarrhea, so I can't attribute it to wiping. Could this be a clue to whether this is UC or Crohn's? I know there really isn't ""normal"" IBD, but is there any one with a similar spectrum of symptoms? I'm curious what has worked for you.  I am also going to switch to a GI who specializes in IBD. Sorry if this is TMI, I really appreciate your advice.",2019-09-04 18:59:53

I know you aren't doctors but looking for real world advice.  I'm a 41 year old Male.

I've been having bad stomach problems the last month or so.  Predominantly a burning pain in my upper abdomen and losing weight and loss of appetite.

My bowel motions are very loose, but I tend to go only once a day.  I have had some anaemia.

I am seeing various doctors and going for an endoscopy and colonoscopy next week.

With IBD is it possible to not be running to the toilet depending how severe it is?

Thanks for any advice",2019-09-12 17:20:36

I hate feeling like I’m being over-dramatic. It’s just a cold, right? Except it’s not. It’s a serious risk of a flare and I do have to be extra careful so I will be taking time off if I need to in order to prevent hospitalisation.

I used the toilet before leaving home. Got to the train station and thought, oh i have to again? ok...

took the train 3 stops, about 5 minutes, and got off to catch a different train. But before i got on the next train, oh again? 

did my thing and walked to the next train. door opened but i couldnt get on... i just stood there.  i would have needed to take the train 3 more stops which is about 6 minutes. I couldnt do it. 

at this point i was scared out of my mind. i had imodium on me and popped 2 pills. i thought i should go back home. 

when i got to the train that would have taken me home, i couldnt get on. what should have been a 5 minutes train ride and a 10 minute walk home, turned into a 55 minutes walk home which i felt safer with. 

&#x200B;

After that day i felt fine. well fine while on the meds i was given for daily use. 

in japan i take iribo once a day

polyful 3 times a day - 1 pill after each meal

and maya-bm 3 times a day

&#x200B;

ive been on the stuff for 3 months and it helps. but isnt 100%. After that last bad event, i went a week of being good. 

After work on a friday i went to use the toilet like i always do before leaving the office. it hit me at that time. i didnt even eat a single thing that day but the flood gates had opened. i took my emergency imodium and sat there for 20 minutes for it to kick in.  I thought i would be ok but when i got to the train, i was filled with fear. so i decided to walk half way home which is an hour. At that point i was able to take a train 3 stops and walk home ok. But when i got home i had to go one more time. 

When i got home i broke down. i think i hit my worst of the worst. i keep thinking how ill lose my job and possibly my family. i went back to the doctor to explain my issue but he just says take the pills for longer time. i told him im scared of trains. i cant eat out in public. i only eat at home. if i need to go out, i dont eat till the day is done. I was at 130 pounds and now im at 115.  


because of this story i posted, im now wanting to do a transplant. found a hospital that will do it about 20 minutes away from me. the problem? the price tag. at this point im not sure if insurance will cover it.

I represent a charity in Canada called the Gastrointestinal Society. We’re currently running two surveys to learn more about the experiences of those with IBD and inflammatory conditions. The first one is an [international survey asking IBD patients what’s missing in their care](https://badgut.org/ibd-survey-2019/). The other survey we’re running is specifically for [Canadian patients who have a disease that’s treated with biologic medications](https://badgut.org/biosimilars-survey-2019/). Disease areas include IBD, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, osteoporosis, psoriasis, HIV, multiple sclerosis, or growth deficiencies, or caregiver of a person who has one of these diseases.

A little bit about us: we’re a small but mighty charity that’s committed to improving the lives of people with digestive and liver conditions (from gum to bum), supporting research, and advocating for appropriate patient access to healthcare, to name a few.

**We’d really appreciate your input by completing our surveys**. **Alternatively, we ask that you share them and spread the word**. Information gathered will be used anonymously and in whole to help shape future programming and raise awareness with community members, healthcare professionals, and decisionmakers.",2019-12-12 00:17:46

I have diagnosed small bowel crohn's. Been diagnosed about a year but symptomatic for 10+ years. I briefly went into remission when I was started on azathioprine. However I developed a nasty reaction to the medication  and had to stop. I had to have all sorts of tests done to see if the damage to my lungs was permanent  and just how bad it was. I believe I'll be started on a biologic in the next month.

My issue is that I'm going through a horrendous flair right now. I can't take the steroids as they just do the most horrid things to me. So I'm having to brave this out alone. I've lost a lot of weight and my choice in what I'm able to actually eat is worse than you'd expect from the most picky five year old.

I'm getting a lot of pain. I'm having to take laxido to make sure anything I do eat can actually get through my small bowel. I'm really struggling. 

A couple of days ago I went to the bathroom and did my business. When cleaning myself up I looked down and realised what looked like a long hollow tube attached to my poop. I have had this happen once before I was told it was probably the lining to some part of my intestine. There wasn't any mucus or anything, that isn't something I have to deal with, really. I'm just wondering if I should be more concerned than I am about it?

The noise and pain has definitely increased over the last few days. I also have sores in my mouth and nose now. I know crohns can get even into those parts of your body.

Should I go and see the out of hours service tomorrow?

Nearly six weeks ago, I had diarrhea, severe cramping on my left side, and nausea and went to the doctor once I started shitting blood. At urgent care I was diagnosed with acute colitis and told to drink lots of fluids and come back if it persisted longer than a week. I already had an appointment with my primary care physician for the following day for something unrelated, so told her about it and she put me on two antibiotics and had me do blood work and give stool samples.

The diarrhea and blood in my stool both stopped within two days of onset, but the nausea, cramping, and pain continued. Blood work and stool samples all came back fine (no anemia, c. diff, e coli, shiga, etc.). My primary care doctor suspected it was diverticulitis, so I got a CT scan to check that (and to check on a kidney cyst that had shown up in an MRI I got for lower back issues). But the scan showed no diverticulitis or diverticulosis so that is ruled out.

Symptoms have leveled off at a pretty low grade - I have occasional cramping, pain, and nausea, usually during or shortly after eating. And I poop less frequently now, every couple of days instead of usually daily. And when I do poop, it's multiple times in that day to where my butthole suffers and my hemorrhoids act up. Generally, just a low key ""I feel like shit"" vibe.

I scheduled an appointment with a specialist, but I won't see him until mid-July. So in the meantime I wanted to check if anyone has experienced similar symptoms. I'm not sure what ailments are even still possible at this point; I'm not anemic and don't have diarrhea so it seems like that might rule out, say, ulcerative colitis. But the fact this is persisting as long as it has does seem like it points to something chronic. Though, days before this started, I finished a steroid dose pack to treat my lower back going out, and that seems very related since steroids and NSAIDs are listed as possible causes for colitis. So not sure what to make of any of this right now. Anyone with ulcerative colitis rarely have diarrhea or anemia?",2019-06-01 20:25:00

Let me tell you my story of an amusing ER visit the other day.,YaaasssPoodle,68,bwppay,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/bwppay/hey_ladies_if_youre_on_mesalaminesalofalk_gather/,13,"This morning, as any other morning, I woke up and took a shovel full of salofalk. Showered, had breakfast and then went to work. Nothing out of the ordinary. A couple hours into work I felt the need to pee, as you do, and went to the washroom. 

When I walked in I noticed a very strong bleach smell. I noticed it because usually our washrooms smell like a mix of fermented urine and butt sweat. 

I sat down to pee while looking around the stall and out the little window that’s right next to the toilet (yep inside the stall). When I got up and turned around though what do I see? My pee is the colour of a nice foamy Guinness! 

I started panicking. Oh my god! My kidneys are finally shutting down. Yep! Years of abusing them with a ton of IBD drugs and now they have given up. I’m only 32. I have so much to live for. What’s going to happen when I die? Who is going to take care of my poodle? I told my boss that my death is imminent and to start looking for a new employee and went to the ER. 

The first thing they told me to do is to pee in a cup. So I started chugging water and went to pee. As I was peeing in a horrified manner I noticed that my pee is actually pee coloured now. Hmm 🤔 what’s going on? Did my kidneys got scared of the nice doctor?

After reading a bunch of papers and talking to the doctor we realized that apparently in addition to the purple staining you can get on your toilet if mesalamine/whatever byproducts it produces mixed with bleach it turns urine almost black. 

End of public service announcement. You can go back to your lives now. 

TL;DR if you take salofalk make sure to flush after cleaning your toilet with bleach or don’t freak out when your urine turns black.",2019-06-04 17:01:05

I didn’t know anything about the disease just thought it was something old people suffered from! I was put on steroids (pred) the side affects were terrible I wasn’t warned about them didn’t think to research. I was a chef at diagnosis CD put a stop to that after untold hospital admissions and trying medication and nearly all the biologics going my IBD consultant told me a colostomy bag is the only option. I was scared at the thought of surgery but done a ton of research and had advice from people that had been through it in online IBD support groups. The advice was positive seeing how a lot of people got some sort of life back I was so looking forward to this and the operation. I had my Colostomy bag fitted January 2017 it was of course a major shock waking to find a bag on my belly where I’d now be having a pony from. Tbh I was so happy for about 6 months after the op I did start flaring after that and had a hernia forming I tried the support belts and vest didn’t help me. I was put on Azathioprine a high dose eventually I ended up in hospital because the Aza had started showing signs of problems with my liver and blood count. The hospital then put me on Vedolizimab for me this stuff was a life changer my surgeon was so pleased with how the Crohn’s had cleared up and suggested a reversal was an option now. I jumped at the chance and agreed to the reversal surgery It was booked in for 20th August 2018 The reversal was successful up until the 27th August I was still in hospital fortunately. The part of bowel they reconnected flaked away and I ended up with sepsis and pneumonia they had to put the Colostomy bag back. I was on intensive care for a couple of weeks on life support The doctors said I am so lucky to be here. A lot of people look at this as a new lease of life a 2nd chance at life I’ve found this very difficult to see myself my mental health has taken a massive nosedive since then up until now. I am under a mental health team and taking medication I’m still finding it really difficult excepting I’ll have this bag for the rest of my life. Obviously this is what happened to me and doesn’t mean it will happen to you just my experience.,2019-06-09 18:03:38

I managed to get my exams pushed back a bit to hopefully get better but that’s not been happening. 

I’ve been on Mesalazine 4.8g everyday since diagnosis about ~2 years ago. When I flared up recently I was put on 30mg prednisilone everyday like last time. My previous flare got under control but this time I haven’t. Still getting a lot of blood/gas/cramps/mucous/diarrhoea. My ibd nurse gave me some laxatives called laxido.

I’ve been booked to have another colonoscopy in about 2-3 weeks. But I’m still really ill and feel like I’m getting worse, especially now I’m tapering off the prednisilone. 
I’m trying to revise for my chemistry final 3rd year exams.  I couldn’t do any revision yesterday cause I felt so bad. My exams are in early July. My options are too sit the exams but I’m potentially going to get more ill, or have my exams pushed back a year :( I’ve been at uni a long time and another year to finish is just depressing. What do you guys think about my situation? 

Do you think I’ll get better rather than worse? Will I be okay taking my exams? How do I unblock my intestinal blockage? Thoughts on this general shitty situation and your experience?

I’ve been having symptoms for over a decade.  Originally I was told I had IBS.  About 4 years ago a gastric Dr told me I had UC.  This was based on biopsies, faecal calprotectin (wasn’t massively high but just over threshold)  and raised CRP and general medical history.  I was given prednisolone suppositories for proctitis and mesalazine which I had to take for maintenance.   Things settled, I got pregnant and had minor ongoing loose bowels but it weren’t too bad.  During this time the Dr that diagnosed me left  the hospital I was under and my care moved to another Dr who never sent me through a follow up review despite me chasing through pregnancy and after.   When my child was about 5 months old I had a flare, pain, urgent, loose stools, blood.  My GP treated me and things seemed to be on the up but I unfortunately got campylobacter.  As the GP wasn’t sure at first if I was having a massive flare ,as the stool sample wasn’t back, or if it was an infection they wrote a shitty letter to my new Dr asking to review me.  I got an appointment and also spoke with an IBD nurse who doubled my mesalazine dose.   Long story short my symptoms have continued,  I’ve had 2-3 colonoscopies since which have come back clear despite continuing symptoms of diarrhoea, urgency, pain, passing blood, fatigue, joint aches etc etc. 

My Dr has since stopped my mesalazine and is treating me as having IBS.  I was started on amitriptyline and he’s talking about putting me forward for an ondansetron trial.  His attitude is I should take loperamide for the loose stools, urgency etc. Meanwhile things have taken a tole on my mental health as my symptoms have become a lot worse so I am taking an anti depressant and getting by each day with my symptoms getting worse. I take loperamide when I have to so I can go out etc but it really just pushes things back and makes the bleeding worse.  My GP has referred me to another gastro for a second opinion after I requested again (I’d asked before but got told no).   Currently I’m experiencing abdo pain,  alternating bowel pattern but urgency and urge to go and mainly looseness, soreness, bleeding, fatigue.  I’m getting joint aches and sores appearing in my mouth. 

Anyone else have a similar experience or any advice of what to ask for?  I don’t think I can go through another colonoscopy....",2019-06-20 20:12:20

They did a CT scan w/contrast and found nothing, gave me some fluids and had me follow up with a GI dr who I saw last Monday. The dr ran a few more stool sample tests for C-diff/infections as well as parasites which came back negative. I have to get a colonoscopy now in a couple weeks as the Dr is leaning towards IBD crohns/colitis. I’m still waiting on results for protein markers that might point to IBD but in the meantime I still am having Nausea and watery diarrhea. I guess what I’m looking for is what symptoms you all had prior to being diagnosed and if what I’m experiencing sounds similar to any of your symptoms. At this point I just want them to find something so they can treat me and I can feel better and I’ll do whatever tests needed. Any thoughts? Thank you",2019-06-22 20:35:36

However, upon getting an emg done, there were indications of nerve damage, possibly related to ibd. I've run through the gamut of just about every test and treatment for pelvic floor disorder with zero results to date, so at this point I'm praying that this ibd may be the cause. The symptoms are simple- my pelvic floor remains in a tense state, and cannot relax during defecation, resulting in my bowel holding waste in. I make sure to get enough soluble and insoluble fiber every day, but perhaps there are aspects of my diet that are causing ibd that I'm unaware of. I have really bad dust/pollen/soil/cat allergies, and thus I'm thinking that my digestive tract may have analogous allergies as well. 

I'm currently booked to see a gastroenterologist about this, though I may see a neurologist soon as well.

First of all, I am a not a native English speaker, so I am sorry if my English is bad. Last january I (17F) was diagnozed with Crohn's Disease and I immediately had to start with azathioprine. Only 5 days later I started with Infliximab (IV medication). I had my first gift at february 5th and my second gift at february 19th. Two weeks ago I had my third gift, 16th March, but I had to give some blood before I was getting the medication to check the value of Infliximab in my blood after two gifts.

I finally got the results back and it says I have 27,00 ug/ml Infliximab within my blood. I don't know of that is high or low, and the internet is vague about it. I can't find out if it is good or not. The Infliximab does work really good for me, so I absolutely don't want to switch to another medication. In 6 weeks time, my calprotectine went from 1570 to 103, so that is really good.

My doctor will call me next week, but maybe some of you are familiar with the values in blood and can tell me more?

I am sorry if this doesn't make any sense, but I hope I can get some answers.

Thanks in advance!

Since my surgery, I have now started to swing the other way. I am having regular highs above 10 and fasting I am sitting between 7 and 9. 

Now I know those numbers aren't scary if you are diabetic. I'm NOT diabetic. However it looks like I am travelling towards type 2.

I would really rather not go down this road, is there anyone else out there that is in a similar situation and has managed to prevent this getting any worse?

Just to note, I am on weekly Amgevita 40mg, no steroids. So it isn't steroids.

1. Thin or flat stool/skinny stool? I get this a lot. When I use Metamucil, I seem to form bigger logs that are formed by a clump of thin flat ones, as if they have been pushed through a blockage or something. Does IBD lead to flat stool, aside from a tumor?

2. Poop of two consistencies. Sometimes I poop a solid descent size poop but followed by mushy thinner ones at the end. 

3.Mostly mushy poop, no bleeding.

4. Have had intermittent painless bleeding over the course of 8 years. No sign that I had been in a flare up or something except that my stool had always been mushy

5. Recently, had abdominal pain on my left side that feels dull most of the time, but radiating and sort of like stabbing at times especially in the middle of the night. This would wake me up, plus I feel a bit nauseated on top of this.

6. I just noticed mucus on my stool since feb.

7. Suffering from tenesmus, though this only happens after I poop. I’d suffer from it the whole day, and then it will go away the following day after I wake up. Then it will happen again the moment I finish going to the restroom. I poop every other day now, since feb. I used to go everyday.

8. Constipation. Does IBD cause constipation?

I am a 24 year old male living in the UK and was diagnosed with UC 4 years ago. I would say my condition is moderate, and my symptoms are described below. Before I start I would just like to thank everyone on this community. This horrible condition can get you feeling down at the best of times, and it is always reassuring to visit this community and know you are not alone.

My first question is around some of the symptoms I have. I have 4-5 bloody bowel movements throughout the course of the day and often these bowel movements will produce nothing but a bloody mucus and gas. I often have a slight stomach cramp/feeling throughout the day, almost as though i can feel the blood/mocus/gas in my lower abdoment. This is often accompanied by a sense of nausea. Does anyone else also suffer with this weird sensation/symptom?

I have been to my doctor multiple times throughout my time with they condition and they have often prescribed me with medication to take, (Asocol I believe). However, I am yet to start taking any medication. I am not sure why exactly this is. I often in my mind come up with lots of crazy reasons not to start taking the medication;

• Currently the cause of all IBD illness are not known and none of the medications cure IBD so there is no point in taking the medication
• I am slightly scared about the side effects of these medications (Do not want to swell up like a balloon as everyone at work will know something is wrong with me)
• I tell myself these symptoms are manageable and okay to live with, but then get down about them very often, so they are clearly affecting me more than I care to admit
• I have resigned to the fact that this condition will control my life, so perhaps that plays a part as to why I do not want to start the medication.
• I tell my self I will cure myself through diet and have tried things like the Carnivore diet and Juicing diets both of which provided decent results but I have always ended up back eating a fairly bad diet and just living with the flare up symptoms (I have low will power in general)

Just writing these out I see how silly it is that I have not started or even tried medication, and I feel stupid for it. Yet I am still not 100% about starting. Has anyone else had this issue, whereby for an unexplainable reason I am not taking any medication and just living in what seems to be a constant flare?

Thanks for taking the time to read and any advice in my situation would be greatly appreciated, as this conditon has been getting me really down lately 

Look forward to your responses :)",2020-04-08 02:25:50

Lately, my body seems to want to give out on me... 

This past week, I had constipation that lead to diarrhea near my period, as it always is. I felt what I thought was a regular period cramp and went to the restroom. Only this time, there was blood in my stool. I just finished Patho for nursing school and recognized it as hematochezia. Bright red, lower GI bleeding. I noticed it happened right after I took aspirin for 2 days. (Within the last two weeks I have also gotten off prednisone which i took for a week or so. The doc acknowledged I had rare symptoms of bradycardia on it) I recently started taking iron and B12 for possible chronic anemia. 

I gave up caffeine for a bit, stopped drinking sodas, and started eating more veggies. I figured I would try coffee since I haven’t had any in just under a week. Well, the bleeding hematochezia happened again! 

I am so scared thinking I have cancer... but also recognize it could be one of the two diseases of IBD.

So this is going to be a relatively big wall of text, I'll try to tl;dr at the end. I'm writing this on behalf of my wife because she doesn't have a reddit account. Ever since we've been together she has always told me that she has IBS. She said she got diagnosed when she was 14 or 15. Well a little over a month ago she had a really bad episode that involved blood coming out of her rectum into the bowl. She was in pretty bad pain and noticed blood in the bowl about 4 times over a 12 hour period. The blood was never a lot, maybe smaller than a nickel each time. Twice the blood was accompanied by mucus. The next day it was gone and didn't return (until today).

She scheduled an appointment with a GI doctor for April 14th. Well as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened, the doctor called my wife and said that instead of having an in-person appointment, they were going to have to do the appointment over the phone. The day of the phone appointment, my wife never received a call. When my wife called the office, they said they tried calling and never got through, but didn't bother to leave a voicemail (?!). So my wife has rescheduled her appointment and now it's not until the end of May.

About a week ago we found out that she was pregnant (yay!). Today however, she had another episode and the last time she went, she noticed blood in the bowl again accompanied by a little mucus. She's pretty convinced that she has a form of IBD now instead of IBS, we just are hoping it isn't the dreadful C word. I was wondering if it could have been hemorrhoids too, but without talking to her GI doctor it's hard to tell. 

Anyways, the point of my post- Now that we know she's pregnant, I began to look online at risks associated with IBD and pregnancy. I found that IBD can be associated with a whole laundry list of risks, including (but not limited to) spontaneous miscarriages, eclampsia, preeclampsia, placenta previa, abruptio placentae, and premature rupture of membranes. I am kind of withholding this info from my wife until she talks to her GI doctor and baby doctor. 

I was wondering if any women here (or men whose significant others) have had IBD and been pregnant. Was there any complications? What precautions did you all have to take?

I know it's all anecdotal, but it will hopefully temporarily relieve my anxiety over all this. Yes she's still talking with her GI doctor at the end of May, and she plans on telling the baby doctor all of what has been going on.

tl;dr- wife may or may not have IBD and is now pregnant. Looking for others who have been in a similar situation.",2020-04-18 03:12:49

317,do i have IBD?,rosesandfoxes,3,g3z7ik,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/g3z7ik/do_i_have_ibd/,6,"hey everyone, hope you're all well during this difficult time.

i'm not one to disclose so much personal info online, but i've dealing with this for now 3 months and just want answers.

it's a long story, but i'll try to make it as brief as possible.

late january, got a pretty severe sinus infection. was going back to college in a few days and so doc put me on Azithromycin (z-pac) and 3 day short course prednisone. sinus infection went away, but started getting super fatigued w/ dizziness/nausea spells and severe heartburn. like, nothing i did would resolve it. 

took a 14 day course of Prilosec that did nothing, and then upped my medication to Pepcid twice a day on top of that. looking back, this wasn't smart. completely shutting off my stomach acid definitely triggered something (what, i'm still trying to figure out), and anyway i started having horrific GI symptoms.

heartburn was still there and was now accompanied by extreme bloating, changes in bowel habits, and pain every time i ate, sometimes to the point that i would only be able to stomach one meal a day. the best way i can describe the pain is that every time i eat my stomach feels really really angry, almost as if its constantly being irritated and inflamed. sometimes the pain would come immediately after eating, other times only hours later would i bloat and the irritation would begin.

okay, got blood work that looked normal (no elevated markers to suggest inflammation, negative for celiac, no ova or parasites) colonoscopy/endoscopy came back w/ chronic peptic duodenitis, mild chronic gastritis, mild active ilietis and prominent lymphoid aggragates. once again ruling out celiac, h.pylori, esophagitis, ileitis, and colitis.

at this point doc suspects SIBO and puts me on xifaxan. does nothing. makes sense bc i got officially tested for SIBO a few days ago (it has been a month since i was on the antibiotic so all kosher there) and it was negative.

but i'm still having all of these symptoms. my diet, you ask? bland as possible. baked/boiled chicken, small amounts of baked tofu, banana, bone/chicken broth, powdered peanut butter, and rice. small meals 3-4 times a day. all of this, by the way, approved by a nutritionist. but i'm still in severe pain w/ bloating every day.

so now i'm at a loss. can't get a capsule endoscopy to rule out crohn's cause of 'rona, but doc thinks that's unlikely anyway based on blood tests and biopsies. SIBO is out, celiac is out, issues w/ other organs (pancreas, liver, large intestine) is prob out too bc i did an MRI w/ contrast that came back unremarkable.

my nutritionist thought my body had lost the ability to process/digest food and so she recommended i start slowing adding back in some foods to try and restart my body's natural digestive processes, but this just made everything so much worse. worse pain and bloating w/ new symptoms like headaches, nausea, extreme fatigue, and muscle aches. for my well-being, i had to stop.

doc is running a fecal fat test to test for fat malabsorption that i should have results back for on monday.

so yea, that's what's going on.

if anyone has any advice they can put forth or ideas, please please please just take a minute out of your day to comment below. but if you're going to leave something condescending or patronizing, please just don't because i really do not have the energy to hear that.

&#x200B;

thanks guys.

again, hope everyone is well.",2020-04-19 03:34:00

This has a lot of other information because it was supposed to be a cross post but it wouldn't let me cross post it,merceec,11,g5lak7,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/g5lak7/losing_weight_with_ibd_and_quarantine_struggles/,11,"So I started using Noom a week ago (like, I'm on day eight I think?) and they immediately give you a low calorie restriction (1200) and when you're a binge eater its really hard to go over. All the people talk about how easy it is and its red and yellow and green foods- but a lot of the foods you'd think would be green are red? Like, certain vegetables you'd think would be green are classed as yellow food. You can only have 300 cal of ""red"" food- (Stuff like honey, protein bars, candy, any kind of fat (so no cheese WHICH SUCKS BECAUSE CHEESE HAS BEEN A SAFE FOOD FOR ME FOR Y E A R S)), 500 cal of yellow food (Which surprisingly counts peas and strawberries and almond flour as yellow.... like what???) and then green foods are like, cucumbers, anything with 0 calories, only certain vegetables and whole grain products.

Caveat- I have crohn's disease as well as an eating disorder. I've recently gone into remission, which means I gained 60 lbs (because after being in ""starvation"" mode, your body grabs on to any calorie) and I'm above 220 lbs which I promised myself I'd NEVER do again. I feel disgusting and awful and I'm doing almost everything right in this fucking app and losing like, a 10th of a lb a day or maintaining. Its such bullshit.

When you have crohns, you're not supposed to have whole grain anything. It can get stuck in your digestive tract (because I have scar tissue and shit) and everything they're saying is a green food can cause an intestinal obstruction that could put me in the hospital. Which I can't go to, because my treatment is infusion therapy, so I have NO IMMUNE SYSTEM.

Also, I joined this app because I thought it would be friendly to crohns (because you have very specific eating restrictions, like trying to limit high fiber foods----WHICH ARE ALL THE FUCKING GREEN FOODS) because you get a personal health coach, but they aren't ever available and they never respond and they give me like, general goddamn advice and I'm like MA'AM. HELP ME. PLEASE.

and I haven't been going to the bathroom like I should be... its just all very fucking stressful on top of quarantine and probably having to miss my first one year anniversary EVER with a boyfriend because of this dumb ass fucking quarantine.

Have been experiencing general GI issues for four-ish months now - including constipation accompanied by passing mucus with little or no stool, occasional diarrhea with certain foods (salads for example), occasional yellow-ish stool, abdominal pain and cramping. Pain began in Dec 2019 after Christmas with intermittent aches, dull to sharp pains lasting a couple seconds to a minute at a time in my lower left abdomen - accompanied by mostly constipation. Pains went away in about two weeks. Experienced occasional bloating, upset stomach, nausea (albeit, I’ve been suffering from nausea since I was a kid) cramping on and off for about a couple months up until now, where I’ve developed some lower right side pain - dull to sharp, kinda achy, kinda stabby sometimes, usually lasts for a couple seconds but I just have a general feeling of discomfort. I just had an upper endoscopy done due to some stomach pain/pain and discomfort under my left ribcage. Everything came back clear - still waiting on biopsy results for celiac disease. Had an upper abdominal ultrasound and everything came back clear. Liver and Kidneys are functioning normally - did blood tests and urinalysis, the only things being off were slightly high cholesterol and low vitamin D. Now, I also had a pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound. Everything was normal aside from what my doctor described as a “simple cyst” on my right ovary that she said is small but still wants me to get a follow up on in a couple months. I was under the impression being on birth control (which I have been for two years now) helped prevent cysts, so this did confuse me - but I was experiencing some breakthrough bleeding/spotting for about three weeks last month leading up to my period/placebo week. This has since resolved. No pain during sex, just the usual discomfort if penetrated too deep. When I first felt the LRQ pain, I twisted my body around a bit and this movement seemed to trigger the pain at that moment. Repeating the movement now doesn’t seem to trigger it anymore, I don’t have pain when pushing down and around in the area (I do hear some bubbling, gurgling sounds when I do sometimes though), and it seems to just happen randomly. I do have chronic back pain, shoulder blade areas, neck, mid to upper, sometimes lower as well. No blood in stool that I am aware of. Sometimes I feel an ache around my rectum/anus area? This is very occasional and probably happens when I’m more constipated but maybe it’s worth mentioning. 

I have an appointment with my OBGYN in about two weeks to talk about switching birth control, and I have a colonoscopy scheduled in about three weeks with the same GI who did the upper endoscopy because he assumes I have IBS, but I worry about being misdiagnosed all the time.

I have been so consumed with anxiety about this lower right side abdominal pain. I can’t tell if this is cyst related, appendix related (no fever), or bowel/intestine related. I am terrified of the following: pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, small intestine cancer, appendix cancer, and even ovarian or cervical cancer, since I did test positive for LSIL and HPV 16 and 18 two years in a row. Can anyone give me an insight on what I should realistically be concerned about or looking for? There is no history of cancers in my family that I know of. I don’t/have never smoked and drink socially and have a glass or two of wine a couple times a week. I know this is all a mouth full but my GI and PCP offered a CT scan of my abdomen if I’m seriously worried but I don’t know if I want to expose myself to radiation for possibly nothing. However, it’s the “something” and the “if” I always worry about.

Hello. My name is Jayne Roberts and I am a post-graduate student at the University of Chester studying towards a Master’s Degree in Applied Psychology. For my post-graduate dissertation, I am recruiting individuals diagnosed with Inflammatory bowel disease to complete a survey about their psychological wellbeing. Participation is open to all sufferers who are 16 years of age and above, with any stage of disease, either active or in remission. The survey is only available in English. The survey will be exploring the relationships between your unmet needs and psychological wellbeing. The questionnaire should take no more than 30 minutes to complete and is hoped to contribute to existing literature and support further research.

I’m hoping this is allowed since I don’t see any rules listed against it but I’m looking to sell some of my Enteragam. Enteragam is considered a medical food (not a drug) that is meant to treat IBD and IBS.  

Alot of people, myself included, have found that it helps a ton with IBD and may even induce remission but its quite expensive at $586 a box (30 packets) if insurance doesn’t cover it and even with insurance coverage the copay can be pretty high.  

If anyone is interested in trying some to see if it helps them before they spend too much money let me know! 

free shipping to USA with tracking number provided

payment via PayPal 

$59 for 6 packets 

$99 for 12 packets

$239 for 1 box of 30 packets  

It helps me alot and has helped many others with IBD (see studies at bottom of page) but coronavirus has massively reduced my income and my stimulus still isn’t here so thats my only reason for selling some.  Regardless of whether you buy it here I think its worth looking into for anyone on this sub.  

**More info on Enteragam:** 

Enteragam is a Bovine Immunoglobulin isolate powder intended for the treatment of IBD and IBS. It is mixed with water and consumed orally. 

Your body secretes immunoglobulins in your GI tract as a part of your immune system already so by consuming a concentrated form of them orally some of it passes through undigested and is active ‘topically’ as it passes through your GI tract.  

The immunoglobulins then bind to harmful microbial components and help to maintain a healthy gastrointestinal system. 

shoot me a direct message if interested.

&nbsp;


**Question**



How should patients on immunosuppressive therapy be advised during the COVID-19 pandemic?


&nbsp;



**Answer**


In general, those patients who have not tested positive, have not been exposed, and are asymptomatic should continue their medications as prescribed.





The American College of Rheumatology issued [a statement](https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/ACR-COVID-19-Clinical-Guidance-Summary-Patients-with-Rheumatic-Diseases.pdf) on April 14, recommending that stable patients continue their medications. Those with known exposure but without confirmed infection may continue hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and NSAIDs.



Immunosuppressants, non–IL-6 biologics, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped temporarily, pending a negative test or after two weeks without symptoms. In patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 infection, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, immunosuppressants, non-IL-6 biologics, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped temporarily, pending a negative test or after two weeks without symptoms. In patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 infection, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, immunosuppressants, non-IL-6 biologics, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped temporarily. Anti-malarial therapies (hydroxycholoroquine and chloroquine) may be continued and IL-6 inhibitors may be continued in select circumstances.^1



The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that the discussion of continuation of biologics be based on a case-by-case basis, citing insufficient evidence to recommend against discontinuation at this time in those patients who have not tested positive. In patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 it is recommended that biologic therapy be suspended until symptoms have resolved.^2

349,Random questions I have that I'm curious about,ulcerativebolitis,7,ga84fk,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/ga84fk/random_questions_i_have_that_im_curious_about/,12,"I have UC and recently I've started a flare up, it is my first flare up since my diagnosis and I was in remission for about 4 months. They treated my first flare up with prednisolone and I had either 2 courses so from my understanding I shouldn't go on it again, which is definitely a good thing for me as it was terrible to be on but tell me if I'm wrong as I'm not completely sure. The side effects lasted way too long and my symptoms looked a lot like Cushing's syndrome but I am no longer experiencing them to a great extent.

I am now on 100mg azathioprine which is what helped me stay in remission but I'm pretty sure a lack of vitamin D (from staying inside) might've been a factor in this flare. And I'm not sure if it's a coincidence, but right before this flare I actually got my period after a few years of losing it which made me really happy but I doubt I will get it again for a while because of this flare.

**Questions I have (answer any you can):**

* Does anyone else get flares after their period / do you think a period can trigger IBD? 
* Is it possible for the flare to go away by itself? And if it doesn't is there any chance they will put me on prednisolone again? 
* Do any of you guys get short/long flares that don't get treated and you just have to push through it? 
* Has anyone else noticed staying inside causing flare ups? Do you think it's from activity levels or sun exposure?
* Has my body become resistant to the azathioprine? Does this mean I can't use it for remission anymore?

I don't have much experience so I wanted to ask here where there are many people with different experiences.",2020-04-29 13:59:36

I’ve been a lurker here for the last few months. It started when I had a lower left back ache that was eventually relieved by taking metamucil. I noticed that with metamucil my stool was never bulky it was skinny and soft (weird).

Over the last few months I’ve experienced pain in my liver (pressure on rib cage), tightness in the right shoulder blade, swollen lymph node under my chin and now burning in the right hip. 

I’m finally getting checked and if the above proves to be CC it’s far too late for me to successfully beat this thing. 

I’m praying that all is negative but it seems that the signs are all there but just presented a little differently since I don’t have pain in my stomach, visible blood on stool or pencil thin poop.

As a person with UC, that peaked my interest.

Now before anyone here decides to judge me, just know that I’ve had UC for about 30 years.  The flares are rarely controlled.  I was scheduled for surgery to remove most of my colon, but I chickened out the night before.  

After decades of dealing with all the worst of the symptoms, and bringing multiple changes of clothes to work, I was beyond desperate.  I decided to try smoking a few cigarettes a day.

It worked. It really, really worked.  I’m absolutely willing to give up a decade or more of my life in exchange for better quality of living.  You can take that to the bank.

I only share this story because yes, I know to most people, smoking is a disgusting habit.  But if anyone can understand my decision, it would be some people in this group.

There is also medical research to support this.  I don’t have it because this was about 5 years ago and while sometimes I get a little bloating, I never worry about the availability of a bathroom.  I can travel without fear.  I got rid of my adult diapers.  My life has become a life again.

I hope each and everyone of you find what helps the most, and for me personally... it's quitting alcohol and rebuilding my gut bacteria. And sugar. Alcohol and sugar, from my experience, have both been the leading factors determining inflammation. I believe that inflammation-causing bacteria feeds on sugar as well as alcohol. I have not drank for a week straight and already my symptoms have improved a lot. But all I can recommend is learning your body, your environmental triggers, what works and what doesn't work. The Wim Hof breathing method has seemed to had an effect too, to my surprise. This type of post has probably been repeated so many times. But I felt the need on this particularly enlightening night to just share and spread these feelings. All the love, all the power.

370,Biopsy Results Confusing?,tdp0506,11,jnvig6,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/jnvig6/biopsy_results_confusing/,6,"Hi! 
I had a colonoscopy last week to determine whether or not I have IBD.

After the procedure, my Dr said he found various spots of inflammation/erosions within my small intestine. He took multiple biopsies and said that what he saw looks like Crohn’s disease, but not to worry myself. 

This afternoon, he called me to explain my results. He said that the inflammation is more significant than he originally thought and the lesions look to be Crohn’s disease. He said that I appear to have Crohns in it’s early stages, but he can’t confirm or deny without further examination. He mentioned that my symptoms do not line up with Crohns and he’s wondering whether I am actually suffering more from IBS and found the Crohns as a coincidence. He said it may not be causing any issues as it is so early on and there’s a chance it may not develop further. I have a wide family history of Crohns and was also diagnosed with an existing autoimmune disorder 5 years ago, so the likelihood that it’s IBD is increased. 

He suggested I try a mild medication to see whether or not it improves my symptoms. He then said that he does not want to under or over diagnose me and hopes that by trialling the medication, it will become more apparent what is causing my symptoms and we can work out the best treatment plan from there. 

Has anyone had a similar diagnosis? I feel confused/scared as I do not have a definitive answer?

My question is, my abscess is about 40% of the size it was, yet I seem to get my symptoms back including elevated HR? Does that sound normal? I saw a PA today with the surgical group who said higher HR is expected with infection and wants to wait a couple of days to see if I get better before prescribing antibiotics.

Will try to make this as short as possible but there is a lot to unpack so bear with me.

I am a 46 y/o female, dx'ed with UC, IBD, GERD about 6 years ago. Thankfully have a great GI dr. who does annual endoscopy and colonoscopy. I have been on a regimen of Apriso that has been working well to control flares.

Fast forward to October of 2020 - started feeling sick at the beginning of the month, nausea, fatigue, back pain, etc. Kind of blew it off until I thought it was a UTI. Went to my Gyn on Oct. 12th - she ordered a transvaginal ultrasound (showed ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids) and treated me for a UTI even though the quick strip urine test was negative. Two days later, pain intensified, ended up in ER with appendicitis that was dx'ed via CT scan. Had appendectomy on the 15th, came home on the 16th.

Had HORRIBLE post surgery constipation - like I didn't poop for 9 days post-op. Surgeon said this was normal, had me discontinue pain meds (Percocet) and start Miralax and Dulcolax to get things moving.   I had already started drinking prune juice and eating oatmeal on my own to see if that would help. Did that and finally got relief but it went too far the other way - had diarrhea and bad gas.

Went for post-op visit - incision scars looked good no signs of infection. Fast forward to 3 days ago, had horrible abdominal pain, ended up back in ER, another CT scan - nothing remarkable except that part of my colon was not ""distended"" so they could not visualize it and degenerative disc disease in L5/S1 which I dealt with back in 2011 with a herniated disc. Radiologist thought abdominal pain and colon finding could be related to the UC and ER doc recommended follow-up with GI dr. So no answers from 2nd ER trip as to what could be causing the pain. 

Saw my primary dr yesterday who is VERY methodical (thank God!) and he was asking about my UC, meds, etc. I realized I hadn't taken the Apriso since probably early October. He prescribed Gabapentin for my back (have to follow up with ortho for that) and wants me to see my GI dr but I can't get an appointment until January! Primary doc thinks the surgery, subsequent constipation, Miralax/Dulcolax, and lack of taking the Apriso were the perfect storm for a flare.

I re-started the Apriso yesterday but my question is twofold - could this be a UC flare, and if so, how long does it typically take for the anti-inflammatory meds like Apriso to kick in? I am a highly anxious person to begin with, so this has me terrified that it could be colon cancer even though I have had colonoscopies every year since 2014.

Has anyone had a similar experience or any words of wisdom to calm me down a bit? I asked the GI dr's office to put me on a cancellation list so I can go in sooner rather than later. I also have a follow-up with the gyn and my primary on the 18th. 

Right now the pain is slightly less but still there. I feel like part of it is that I have not been active - resting on couch since the 16th and my back has been so bad. 

Any insight or words of support/wisdom appreciated!",2020-11-07 19:30:26

I feel better than I have ever in my life. Over the years I’ve had weird, flattish stools and sometimes slight dhiarrhea. Nothing else, no blood, no fatigue, no pain. I had a colonoscopy at 28 that revealed nothing. Doctor diagnosed IBS and that’s what I’ve thought it was for years.

Since losing weight and changing my diet, I’ve had better stools than ever in my whole life; however, for the last year, I’ve had mild anemia come up in bloodwork as my only abnormal value (HgB 12.5 average). 

Dr. recently sent me to have a colonoscopy/endoscopy to check for bleeding and/or colon cancer or polyps (runs in my family). Results came back with some very small ulcers in my colon and doctor now seems reasonably confident that I have mild Crohns? I have a fecal test, blood tests and mri coming up soon to confirm.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Crohns with few/very mild symptoms? Dr is starting me on Mesalamine to get my colon to heal. I’m not looking forward to the prospect of potentially being on another medication for the rest of my life, but I’ll follow drs orders.",2020-11-08 03:13:02

I've moved out of my parents' house last summer to reduce public transit travel times for my internship, especially with the pandemic going on and whatnot. The woman who is renting me my room owns two cats, who both never really seemed to get along with me. I don't blame them.

I've been diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis almost over a decade ago and have been lucky enough to only suffer through minor flare-ups occasionally. It's been mostly at rest for the past couple of years, however stressful times seem to have taken its toll and I've had a few days of awful cramps and stomach pains. Today, after spending the weekend at my parents' house, I got to my room and almost immediately one of the two cats came spending time with me, snuggling close and coming into my room and whatnot. (They've never been in there since I moved in)  


He's been happily purring and kneading biscuits on my stomach most of the day now, while he'd usually try to find the room furthest away from me. Surely, this is nothing more than a coincidence, right? Has anyone else who owns cats ever had experiences similar to mine?",2020-11-09 17:41:47

Fast forward a few years and I have had a rollercoaster of symptoms ranging from thin stool, a few years of remission and normal stool, constipation that resulted in anal fissures.

The fissure period has plauged me for about 6 years. I finally had surgery to correct them and post surgery I began having these awful flare ups of issues that I hadn't experienced for years. I lost 20 lbs because I didn't want to eat.

Here is what I'm going through pretty much on a weekly basis right now: Excessive gas, cramping and my stool will start as type 4, but thin, and end up type 6 after going multiple times. Each time I go, I pass gobs of mucous. I passed some so large that it almost looked like sloughing tissue of my intestines.

There is no visible blood in any of this outside the mild blood I get on the wipe from all the chafing and wiping I'm doing.

Then after going to the point where I'm passing basically nothing but mucous, my body will calm down and I'll go into a small remission. The next day what will typically happen is I'll get either a slightly hard, normal stool again, or it goes back to type 4/5 but super soft and in pieces. 

During this flare I feel awful. My gut feels inflamed. I will think I need to go really bad and sit down to pass nothing but pure mucus sometimes. I'll try to pass gas and pass mucous.

I'm waiting for my GI appointment. It's weeks away due to high patient volume and Covid. Does anyone relate with these symptoms as a possible, underlying IBD?",2020-11-09 13:18:43
391,Posted 50d ago. Things have changed. Very frustrated!,emeraldsaiyan_92,7,jqod9l,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/jqod9l/posted_50d_ago_things_have_changed_very_frustrated/,11,"I posted on this sub 50 days ago looking for advice before diagnosis. I took on all the advice and support from those who commented so thank you so much for that! 

I’m posting again because My circumstances have changed somewhat and I’m not becoming so frustrated. On my last post I was waiting for a gastro referral which thankfully came through pretty swiftly and the consultant booked me in for a colonoscopy within 2-3 weeks.

I was so happy that this was finally getting sorted as my symptoms were still the same: blood and mucus in stool, going to the toilet 10+ times a day, extreme fatigue, nausea, abdo pain. 

However the day before my pre op I found out that I was pregnant. Extremely happy but also extremely worried and concerned. I’m a health professional myself and had a bad feeling they wouldn’t proceed. 
I put myself at around 3 weeks pregnant at this point. And low and behold the pre op nurse told me outright that it couldn’t be done. I knew this would be the answer but I sobbed my heart out anyway. Luckily the consultant agreed to do a flexi sig instead. No drugs. Smaller camera. But only looks at part of the colon. 
I had the procedure on the 11th Oct but by then my symptoms had lessoned somewhat. To me that was great and I thought that maybe the pregnancy was doing it’s wonderful thing and healing my body a little. 
They couldn’t see anything untoward on the camera but took some biopsies anyway.

Since that day my symptoms had gotten much better, still going to the toilet but not as painful, seeing blood but not as much and getting mucus from time to time. But hallelujah I could tolerate more food again! 
Flash forward to this weekend. I would go as far to say that it had been the worst it’s ever been. I’ve never seen so much blood in my stools, the mucus is practically pouring out of me. The pain is making me close to passing out. I can’t eat and my aversion to food is coming more and more because I’m terrified of that pain coming again. My husband called an ambulance Friday night because I couldn’t breathe or move from the pain. 

The pregnancy on the other hand is very healthy and baby is doing well. I had an early scan today which showed baby measuring at 8weeks and 3 days with a little heartbeat fluttering away nicely. 

But because of my little bug growing there. No one will touch me, I have been to A+E three times this weekend. 
Yesterday I was told by a doctor that if I have 6 or more bowel movements like this in 24 hours I have to be admitted. I had only had two but the pain was unbareable. My rectal exam was normal with no active bleeding. They can’t give me any pain relief except for paracetamol which doesn’t touch it and because of morning sickness I throw it back up anyway 

The latest tonight, in the hospital I work at....
My blood work is normal. My urine is normal. My observations are normal. My rectal examination is normal and shows no active bleeding. The same as the last two times. Even though the blood in my stools are clear and I even showed the doctor a picture I took the hour before. And she made no comment. 
She sent me home saying to follow up with my GP as everything was normal - even though I have given her the full history and blood and mucus in your stool is certainly not normal. 

(Also My mom had bowel cancer in her early 40s as well as my grandmother. So you can imagine the panic gripping me too. But no one seems to acknowledge this!) 

Especially with being pregnant. If I have got IBD and I am in a flare then I know the risk of miscarriage and to the pregnancy isn’t great. I am just so frustrated that my bloods aren’t reflecting what my body is doing and because I am pregnant no one wants to do anything or investigate further. 

The disparities between doctors is so huge and I haven’t seen a specialist for months. Neither are my biopsies back yet. 

I don’t know what I’m asking for or hoping for. Maybe just some advice or if anyone has been diagnosed whilst being pregnant? 

I just don’t know where to turn and I just honestly feel like crying forever or giving up, I just want to be healthy for me and my baby. And do the job I love without having to go off sick all the time.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

TLDR; pregnant and struggling for diagnosis because no one will touch me. Getting very frustrated!",2020-11-09 02:43:04

I only realised that there might be a connection years after, during a nasty flare when I was so anxious that I resumed smoking. 4-5 cigarettes a day and my symptoms were nearly gone within a week or so. It is probably not capable of inducing full remission, but I have been using low-dose smoking as a supplement during relapses since, and I quit again while I'm in remission. I am also convinced that smoking delayed my initial diagnosis by years. It is also interesting that it apparently helps with UC but has the opposite effect with Chron's as it makes its symptoms worse.

There is quite a few studies on this matter although they have not find any clinical evidence yet, they usually confirm the effect but conclude that more research would be necessary to separate which substance(s) in cigarette smoke help lower the inflammatory burden in the GI tract.

So I had a really stressful situation today. I’ve been having abdominal pain from crohn’s for a few weeks now and waited weeks for an appointment and even drove to a far imaging center because they had the first available appointment. Went in for my MRI 45 minutes early to drink the barium contrast. They didn’t bring it out until I had 25 minutes left until my appointment. I drank 1.5 bottles but also have emetophobia so couldn’t force it down too fast. They expected me to drink at least 2/3 within that 25 minutes. They kicked me out right at my appointment time because they said they had a “tight schedule” and couldn’t wait for me to drink another half a bottle (would’ve taken five minutes) and told me to reschedule... Keep in mind that these appointments book out months in advance bc I live in California. They also made me drink the contrast in the full waiting room while covid is booming and I’m on remicade (an immunosuppressant). Anyways besides the point, this really was an anxiety/anger inducing encounter. They yelled at me for wasting their time and I have anxiety as well and it was really hard for me to handle.

I've had IBS since I was 18 (I'm 32 now) but my symptoms changed last year from alternating constipation and diarrhoea that was linked to changes in diet, stress or lack of sleep, to constant urgency, diarrhoea and bleeding. 

Before we got locked down in March, I was having severe anxiety and finding it hard to leave the house and I feared social occasions. I'd suddenly get gut pain, nausea, and feel too hot and shaky, and then diarrhoea. 

My symptoms have improved somewhat since I cut down on fibre in my diet, but my diet is now very limited. 

It took longer to get the colonoscopy because of lockdown but I'm so glad I've had it done because now I have a diagnosis and an IBD specialist nurse I can speak to.

For a period of about a month, I had symptoms that closely resembled ulcerative colitis, namely ulcers in my large intestine, diarrhea that was sometimes bloody, pain, and fatigue. The diarrhea has stopped being bloody, and there was no sign of anything like ulcerative colitis on my colonoscopy. My gastroenterologist said I have absolutely nothing to worry about, but I've been having the following symptoms: 

* Pain in mid-abdomen no matter what I eat
* What feels like gas buildup in the general vicinity of my large intestine but no passing of gas (i.e. unless it happens when I'm sleeping, I don't burp or fart) 
* Strange hiccough-like spasms that happen after eating
* Chest pain and heartburn
* Chronic diarrhea that is hard to pass, almost like having constipation... but what comes out is diarrhea
* Feeling extremely cold upon passing the diarrhea 
* Feeling weak, tired and dizzy despite eating healthily and taking a variety of supplements
* Losing weight unintentionally, but not drastically
* Horrible joint pain

I have suffered all the usual symptoms of a colitis flare for 4 years now, progressively getting worse and staying truly awful for about 2 years. We are talking the standard bloody stools/pure blood when opening bowels, cramps, urgency and 10+ times a day on average (I do have better days when I take Imodium and have eaten less the day before!).

Had all the standard medication,  Mesalamine oral (3x800mg) in combination with enema (1g) twice daily, omeprazole, 5 separate courses of steroids in the last 14 months (40mg tapering prednisolone oral), tried  *adminulab* (Hurima) for 9 months to no avail.

I am currently on a combination of maintenance meds after coming off of prednisolone and subsequently budesonide  & have had 3 infusions of **Infliximab** so far since being hospitalised for a week this August, about to have my 4th in a few days.

My gripe is this. I respond *very very very well* to the prednisolone, down to 2-3 times a day and sometimes without blood!!!! However, after all these courses, I feel like it is fucking with my head.. putting it bluntly.

I also am having issues with the infliximab. I understand it takes time to work, however I did not respond to the adminulab and feel like it is giving me no improvements and only side effects.

So about the infliximab. Obviously there's the whole immune suppression + corona situation which isn't ideal, however my only problem with that is taking up a hospital bed over somebody else. But I digress. My real issue is the headaches(?) and undeniable weight gain + *it seemingly not working*. Not to body shame anybody but I am very conscious of my weight and I feel like I have been wrapped in a layer of fat. My face is puffy, I have man boobs and I have never seen my stomach so prominent. Folds on my arms, neck etc and as somebody who is highly self critical & eats cautiously its kinda my final straw. Even my family comment on it. I have gone from \~60kg to 72kg in 3 months. I am only 174cm so this to me is rather evident.

I am unsure where I am going with this post but I feel like I have nobody who can relate to colitis my medication issues. I would love to hear from any of you with a similar experiences and solutions...! I am also a very good listener, so any body with any issues, not even colitis related, I am happy to be a set of ears and hopefully a beacon of positivity and guidance :) I rarely use reddit so expect slow replies, although your best bet is Instagram, ""coldzera97"" is the tag. Would love to chat as colitis + anxiety is a rather lonely couple.

If you have got this far I appreciate it so much, I wish you the best of health and happiness in all senses!

My Ex wife had Crohns disease so I kind of have an idea but it's been a while.

My Boyfriend is already saying how once he's on medication he wants to eat wings,  Pizza, and poutine. I tried to tell him that it will depend on what he's allowed/able to eat. To which he says that there's no diet because it is not caused by food? I know IBD isn't really caused by food but I know that certain foods can cause flair ups in cases. He had an awful diet beforehand so I think it will be a long road ahead of him. I decided not to fight with him on it yet, and to just let his Doctor have the discussion with him when he see's him next.

No idea if he has Crohns or UC but hopefully we will find out soon! Any tips or info would be appreciated, I'm reading up on it as much as I can while he's in hospital.

**UPDATE:**

My Bf is still in the hospital but will be out on Monday. He has been diagnosed with UC, and his Doc has told him to cut back on some of the junk. He has also been told to cut out Coca Cola from his diet, because this flair up that sent him to the hospital was apparently made a lot worse from all the sugar. My Bf doesn't think his Cola addiction is that bad, but I kept track of it for the month of October to actually see. In one month he had 55 cans of cola as well as a 2L bottle, which equals out to about 579 teaspoons of sugar! Will he actually quit Cola? Hard to say but he may listen to the Doc better than me. At least he's feeling better now and he knows going forward how to handle.

I don’t have diarrhea, I don’t have urgent bowel movements. If anything, I struggle more with occasional constipation. Little to no cramping. I did have a colonoscopy done that revealed a patch of inflammation near my rectum/lower sigmoid and a patch near my appendix area. Doc told me that’s what was causing the bleeding. No hemorrhoids or anything like that. My GI told me I had colitis and started me on 40mg of Prednisone (which i’m still taking). The prednisone didn’t do ANYTHING. He scheduled me for another colonoscopy a few weeks later to see if the inflammation had responded to the steroids but there was no improvement. Now he is telling me Crohn’s and wants to start me on Humira which I am so nervous about. Do you think I am being misdiagnosed? Since my second colonoscopy, the bleeding has slowed down a lot, now only a few drops on the toilet paper afterwards. I mostly feel fine other than seeing blood every time I have a bowel movement.

The process is getting to me a bit so I thought I'd reach out for some support and advice. I've had a colonoscopy as well as a CT scan, and I've got some sort of lab coming up tomorrow. (Prometheus IBD SGI Diagnostic, to be specific) Overall I've funneled about $600 into this and I still owe $500 so far. They gave me anti-spazz pills at the very beginning, which surprisingly were a huge help right off the bat. I struggle to take them regularly, but I've been doing my best. 
 
 
 
 
I used to get debilitating stomach pains every morning, but that's gone now with the pills and a protein bar as soon as I get up. And sorry if this is TMI, but my BMs actually started being REGULAR! More like clockwork and less like a RNG. Physically I'm great.

I'm a mess socially so new doctors and new people get me really overwhelmed. And how can I NOT be freaking out over the costs?

I had abscess/fistula surgery about a month ago. I have a hard lump on my inside right cheek that the doctor says is inflammation from Chron’s.

Anyone have any tips on how to reduce the inflammation? The doctor advised just to wait until the Entyvio kicks in more but if I can do other things in the meantime I’d like to try.

Thanks!",2020-11-21 03:27:51

489,IBD Body hacking,tuc71987,11,jz98w1,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/jz98w1/ibd_body_hacking/,2,"Hello All,

 I want to encourage everyone to hang in there. I have been there but I have been fighting extremely hard, and winning- as of late.

Wanted to share my regime with you - This is apart from the Xeljanz 10mg that I am taking daily (which def helped me gain weight but I was still having symptoms of loose stool and pain)

When I do get a flare I seem to bounce back within a week or so. Past two weeks however I have been able to get back to my normal weight of 140lbs which I have not been able to do in 3 years. I contribute the weight gain to a few factors which I will rank in order of most profound impact to least profound. 

**1.Wheat Grass Juice**

\- Sounds meh but I read a few studies and saw some posts on it on reddit and decided to find some quality wheatgrass juice. The paper:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11989836/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11989836/)  


Strong evidence in the paper so I did a few hours of research and bought some grass from this place:

[https://www.dynamicgreens.com/?id=Google&gclid=CjwKCAiAtej9BRAvEiwA0UAWXjXk1RTlGP6\_xSAOZVMp7B9e-Yx3UH5k1tjVlt08zxEgkhIpTSS-9BoCvocQAvD\_BwE](https://www.dynamicgreens.com/?id=Google&gclid=CjwKCAiAtej9BRAvEiwA0UAWXjXk1RTlGP6_xSAOZVMp7B9e-Yx3UH5k1tjVlt08zxEgkhIpTSS-9BoCvocQAvD_BwE)  


They ship fast and the quality of their grass is far superior than I ever expected. I take 4 cubes (2oz) every morning for past 3 weeks and it has completely stopped my burning pain. Highly recommended

**2. Debutir Butyrate**

\- You know all about Butyrate, its hard to get to colon. Found this supplement which has great results overseas and used to be sold here. Readily available on ebay. I take one in AM and one in PM with great results. Check out the article

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936115/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936115/)  


**3. Kate Farms Formulary**

\- Think of this as the Rolls Royce of Ensure supplementation. This hasn't helped my UC as much as it has helped me put on weight very quickly. It has all organic non gmo ingredients, no allergens with a phyto chemical profile and an optimal protein carb fat ratio for high absorption. You can live off this stuff and its about 400 kcal a pop. I use the standard 1.0 formula.

**4. 2'Fl**  
A Human Milk Oligosaccharide that is not digested by the body but instead goes to the colon where it is fermented into short chain fatty acids like Butyrate. 2'FL is the most abundant fucose group in breast milk and helps build the gut microbiome. I have been using Digest 2FL during the day with food  
[https://www.newtrition.com/pages/digest2fl](https://www.newtrition.com/pages/digest2fl)  
**5. Juven**  
A unique blend of arginine glutamine and most importantly HMB. Abbott labs has a patent on the HMB and it is used in the hospital for patients who are on bedrest to not lose muscle mass. This has some great papers on it too and I suspect it is helping me keep on some muscle and possibly helping accelerate gut healing.

Monday morning I ended up throwing up my entire dinner, leading me to having to call in sick to work. Of course in the middle of a pandemic calling in sick is grounds for a COVID19 test. So, my Monday consisted of vomiting, feeling like shit and going to get tested for COVID19 so I can return to work. 

It is now Tuesday and I am bleeding again. This is a full circle to how I discovered something was very internally wrong.

The review identified 23 studies containing 243,760 IBD patients and 1,028 COVID cases, and they attempted to have separate data from the well-known [SECURE-IBD database](https://covidibd.org/current-data/). The review found that symptoms were similar between IBD and non-IBD populations, with the exception of increased diarrhea in the IBD population (surprise!).

The second is a [letter to the editor](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(20)31142-3/fulltext) about the first study, noting that the prevalence of COVID in IBD cases in the first study is comparable to the general population, likely due to strong preventive actions (side note: this is consistent with “as good if not better” outcomes in many health areas, as the IBD population is very active about health screening). The authors also point to another study showing that IBD patients tend to have milder outcomes than in the general population. This is thought to be due, in part, to tnf alpha blockers like remicade and humira that can help squash the cytokines storm in severe COVID cases that can cause pulmonary or systemic damage. This is consistent with clinical trials involving remicade for severe COVID treatment.

The [third study](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(20)35117-9/fulltext) is related to this last point. It looked at the prevalence of COVID in a tracked IBD group taking biologics versus the broader population in order to see how common it was for IBD patients on biologics to contract COVID. The study found that the incidence of COVID was similar to the broader population. It also found that immunosuppression was not an additional risk factor for severe COVID, consistent with other coronaviruses.",2020-11-29 18:42:31

But the last six months or maybe a year, I've been having very sporadic symptoms. With the colitis, it's very consistent - when I'm flaring, I pretty much never have a firm stool until I get out of the flare. With this, I'll have 1-3 days of symptoms including gas, loose and liquid stools, gut pain, and bloating, and then 4-7 days of normal stools with no pain or other symptoms. My doc suspects that I have IBS on top of the UC. I'm currently in the process of getting tested to confirm that my symptoms aren't being caused by the UC, just to be totally sure, but blood tests have so far come back normal.

Does anyone else have experience with this? I didn't know it was possible to have both IBS and a form of IBD, although I guess since they're caused by different things it makes sense.

Tldr; I'm afraid that going to bed instead of the toilet with my diarrhea will result in colitis. Is this possible?

I want to preface by saying that I fo not have Ulcerative Colitis. But about 5 months ago, I had to go to the hospital from what my doctor suspects was bacterial colitis, some people have told me it sounded like acute colitis.

The events of what lead up to me waking up with unimaginable pain in my stomach and blood in my feces seem to be happening tonight. I am having a bout of diarrhea tonight, and my stomach is bloated and uncomfortable, just as it was that night. I guess I'm still traumatized, but I'm so scared right now. I don't want to go through that again. 

My question is, do you think that forcing yourself to go to sleep while you're suffering from diarrhea (instead of letting your body purge everything) result in whatever's causing the diarrhea to grow inside of you and cause a case of colitis?",2020-11-30 07:55:26

538,I don't feel like I am emotionally capable of going through with or coping with my upcoming colonoscopy,,12,cm55si,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/cm55si/i_dont_feel_like_i_am_emotionally_capable_of/,11,"TLDR at the end of the post.

I (23f) have an appointment for a colonoscopy in 2 weeks as a step to finally diagnose my more than 10 years of chronic gastrointestinal issues. I have never had a colonoscopy before. My primary care physician, gastrointestinal doctor, and colorectal surgeon all think I have Crohn's disease, not just IBS.

When I was 13 years old, I was supposed to get a colonoscopy. I did all the prep for it, but when I got to the hospital, I was terrified and unable to go through with it. The reasons why I didn't go through with it then were the nurse saying the IV with the sedative drug would sting a bit, and also because I found out that the doctor who would be doing the procedure was a man.

The doctor being a man was particularly distressing for me. The morning of my colonoscopy, I was also so nervous about the procedure because of the fear of being naked, exposed, getting touched, and being so vulnerable in front of people. I was anxious enough that my family member (who I was living with) knew something else was at the root of it, and had to beg me to tell her what was going on.

That was the morning I first told anyone that I had been molested as a child.

So the stress of revealing my long time childhood abuse, finding out that the doctor would be a man, and being told that the IV was going to sting, all led me into backing out of the procedure.

Now, the doctor who will be doing my procedure in 2 weeks is a female doctor with an all female staff (I was told that only the anesthesiologist might be a man but put in a request that they please find a female anesthesiologist). I met the doctor and she is a kind woman with a safe vibe. But I still feel so uncomfortable and sick to my stomach thinking about the procedure.

The thought of the scope being inside me, people literally looking into my open body, and my anus being stretched or even just touched (I have anal fissures, anal skin tags, and a rectal fistula, so I anticipate pain afterwards) is disgusting and horrifying to imagine.

I am also scared of the anesthesia or of being awake during the procedure but being unable to move while feeling everything that's happening. I anticipate that I will feel physically ill after the anesthesia wears off because I am very sensitive to substances. I also have extreme anxiety issues. I get crushing waves of anxiety from having to take something like ibuprofen or a vitamin.

I have to get the colonoscopy and diagnosis done before I get surgery for my fistula, and eventually my skin tags. The surgeon told me that if I have Crohn's, she will have to a take different course of action for the surgery than if I didn't have Crohn's.

Has anyone felt like this? Have you been putting off an appointment or procedure because you are scared?

Thanks to anyone who read this post.

TLDR I was going to get a colonoscopy when I was a teen, but the morning of, I first told someone about my childhood abuse. Now, I am scared to get the colonoscopy. I don't want the scope in my body and am scared of physical pain in my anus and feeling sick after the procedure. Has anyone ever been in this situation?",2019-08-05 04:33:31

548,A Poem about IBS,chennin1,14,cp3elq,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/cp3elq/a_poem_about_ibs/,1," 

I'm a performance poet who deals with IBS. I hope you enjoy this poem that I've written to help deal with IBS. The formatting is a little odd, because I format it in a way that's conducive to reciting and performing it.

**An Ode to My Stomach**

I saw a bird in the park,   
eating a worm   
like it was created just for her.  
The bird ate the worm,  
pooped on the sidewalk  
without a blink of worry in her tiny eyes,  
and hopped away.

Everyone always says  
it’s great “to be as free as a bird,”  
as if it’s great to be free to fly   
wherever you want to go.  
I’d say you’d be as free as a bird  
when you can shit on the ground

and know that nothing else in your life  
will change because of it.

The freedom  
 to shit 

anywhere.

Although not ideal to everyone,

it’s a good deal in those numbered suitcases

on those game shows  
when you have   
IBS,

Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

35 million Americans with IBS,  
screaming why they can’t   
be free birds.  
People who wish they could just  
shit on the ground  
when things get unbearable - 

and we can all move on.

The world can keep spinning,  
and no one blinks an eye  
at our troubled fates suddenly turned   
normal.

I will be brave and tell you all  
my stomach has failed me too

with this...inconvenient syndrome   
my stomach has known as truth. 

The worry is constantly near,  
an annoying shoulder angel of humiliation 

always whispering in my ear. 

She’s telling me it could my doom today.

I’m running to the bathroom   
the way some people run from change.  
Not always noticeable   
that I’m running to the coffee shop bathroom  
when I’m trying to look   
like I’m not.  
But it’s definitely happening.

I like to think   
that my whole body is fire  
and has the depth in it to cultivate flaming passion.  
That’s why I always get   
burning sensations in my stomach.

Hence, what I wish I could tell my stomach:   
I am sorry.  
I’m sorry you are picky

and think I am a bird when   
unfortunately I’m not.  
I’m crossing off lists  
of food you don’t like.  
Should I swallow diamonds?  
Eat only what gods should digest?  
Tell me!  
I wish you hadn’t retired

from helping me,  
angry with whatever I’ve done.

I wish you hadn’t

gotten on the boat,  
drifted off to go fishing.

People ask

where you’ve gone  
and I just say my stomach   
thought there were better options  
than staying on land with me.

Stomach, I miss you and your help   
with food that’s anything but  
bread and dry lettuce.  


My therapist said the way to deal with this  
is to pretend my stomach didn’t leave me

out in the middle of this desolate, sandy beach  
while my stomach is on a never-ending vacation.

Maybe pretending makes my stomach return! 

But stomach.  
You’ve still made me flutter away

from living properly,

when I am meant to be a grounded human.

I am not meant to be a bird, 

although it sounds nice. 

I’ll be waving to you   
from the shore sometimes.  
I’ll give you the middle finger when you 

turn your back to me out on that yacht,  
surrounded by pelicans in the sky who mock me.

You rich bastard,  
not appreciating the cake.",2019-08-12 00:26:45

He then proceeded to get sarcastic and say “just don’t eat broccoli for breakfast lunch and dinner and take these suppositories and I’ll see you in a few weeks”. There was never no follow up call or anything. This is not at all comforting to a 22 year old female who has dealt with these symptoms for over a month, has had multiple degrading accidents from failing to get to the bathroom in time, and has been barely eating to begin with. I now come to reddit to help me with some questions I have:

1. Should I get a second opinion?
2. Is colitis the same thing as ulcerative colitis? If not is colitis still IBD?
3. What foods should I be eating?
4. Why do I have abdominal pains if it’s only by the rectal areas?
5. Leave me any advice or tips for encouragement purposes :)

I’m looking for some advice to keep myself out of hospital between now and my appointment in December (earliest they could fit me in). 

I [27F] got diagnosed with UC about 3 years ago, it was mild, not a lot of blood, or too many issues. By the I had been through the tests and had the diagnosis, I was already in remission so they never gave me any drugs. 

I then moved to the other side of the city and had to leave that clinic and I never rejoined one as my symptoms were mild. 

Unfortunately now my symptoms are worse than they have ever been. There is a lot of blood and blood clots and it’s quite frightening to see.

I called up my GP and they referred me in “urgently” to a specialist, saying she couldn’t give me any medication and I had to get it from the specialist. She also told me if I got worst I should go to A&E.

When I booked the appt with the specialist the earliest the could fit me in was December. So now I’m worrying. 

I don’t want to get so bad I end up in A&E, I don’t even know at what point I would be severe enough to go any way. 

So I’m wondering if anyone has any tips for inducing remission or keeping it from getting worse over the next three months? 

TL;DR my UC symptoms are the worst they have ever been, but I can’t be seen by a doc until December so I want to know ways I can keep symptoms at bay.",2019-08-28 22:32:29

585,Help Wanted: Demon Hunting,DrSpontaneous,7,gdf3u2,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/gdf3u2/help_wanted_demon_hunting/,10,"  

After a few years of struggling on and off, I figured I would finally take some time to write out what I’ve been going through to see if anyone has had any similar experience. I’ll try to keep it brief, but I would appreciate the read. 

Every couple of weeks for the past few years, I’ve been having “episodes” of an origin that I can’t quite place. The worst of which happened about half a year ago while I was on vacation in Colorado and was bad to the point that I nearly took myself to the hospital. The most recent episode was today and has been sticking around for the past month or so. In Colorado, my anxiety progressed to full blown panic attack in the back of an uber with a driver who wouldn’t stop talking about the development of the human brain while I was quietly dying in the back seat. My fingers and toes and face would tingle, I had the cold sweats, shortness of breath - the full gamut. I got home and had a painfully loose bout of diarrhea. 

The symptoms, to me, always seem primarily gastrointestinal with secondary symptoms that spread through my body. Bloating/discomfort spikes during these episodes, and for the week following, the area under my ribcage felt full, as if someone had surgically put a pork tenderloin below my diaphragm. I would be constipated for a couple of days, and then once I finally had a movement, diarrhea would follow immediately afterwards. (TMI warning) It always had a burning sensation, looked like silt, and often had pieces of fibrous vegetables like leafy greens that had been undigested. Sorry for being so blasé about it, but I’m beyond the point of shame. My sinuses would be inflamed, I have chronic shortness of breath/mild asthma, and the back of my tongue would be covered in what I assume is dead skin cells/food/bacteria. During a particularly bad episode a few weeks ago, my tongue had become pale. These were accompanied by a mild headache and worsened tinnitus. 

Occasionally, when I eat acidic foods, I get a pain in my middle back. It’s like a crampy pain, that escalates and then de-escalates in the span of about a minute. I usually use a heat pack to relax the muscles there. Lately, my knees and ribs have been hurting in a way that almost feels arthritic. On the backs of my upper arms, there is a rash (resembling keratosis pilaris) that seems to come and go.

As to my diet: in the past month I’ve cut out dairy, gluten, added sugars, alcohol, coffee, and junk food in general. It has helped to a degree, but I’ve still been feeling inflamed and anxious, also finding it difficult to fall asleep at night without melatonin. Right now I’m taking a multivitamin to make up for any deficits. My doctor has prescribed me with Miralax but I’m not taking it right now thanks to diarrhea. I have also been prescribed Flonase, Cetrizine, and Budesonide but it seems to me like they are treating the symptoms rather than the cause.

I’m really looking for help. I’d like to go to my doctor and be able to ask him to look for something specifically. I’m also looking for anyone with a similar experience who may be able to share some knowledge. Thanks for the read.

My insurance doesn't kick in for a few days so I'm trying to do some self-diagnosis in the meantime to get a head start on treatment for whatever I have. I've narrowed it down as likely one of these two issues. 

Basically, I've been having tenesmus, bloody stool, and rectal pain for 3 weeks now. I started eating tons of fiber and drinking tons of water and I guess it's helped. My pain and blood definitely peaked about a week and a half ago and has since been getting a little better, but I still want to get a better idea of what's going on.

There's been a lot of blood, coloring the toilet water red and completely coating stool, which made me think it maybe wasn't an anal fissure, but maybe it's coupled with internal hemorrhoids. 

With BMs I have a sort of mild sharp pain, and it actually usually begins shortly before I have a BM, when I can feel it bearing down (also get the same stabbing pain when I have to pass gas sometimes). During the BM, I'll have involuntary inner contractions that push everything out, sort of like when you have diarrhea (but my BMs are usually pretty hard despite the fiber). The pain isn't that bad, but the real bad part is afterwards I get this deep ache that radiates all the way down to the back of my thighs. It usually lasts several hours, and will come back if I sit or go lax on my advil/tylenol rotation. 

Obviously I won't take any input as actual medical advice, but for those who may have experience, does this sound more like an AF or proctitis?",2020-05-05 23:43:34

Symptoms include: super painful intestinal cramps, going diarrhea more than soild, getting upset stomach after eating, randomly running low grade fevers, lots of mucus in stool, occasionally blood in stool (dark red/black mucus), some food makes me really sick (milk and pork), vomiting easily, easy dehydration due to diarrhea, not able to gain weight (seriously I eat 2000+ and cant get over 115 lbs), poop out undigested food, acidic yellow stool that burns.... theres more I just can't think of. 
Been to 6 gastro doctors and the most they do is an upper endo and tell me to increase my antidepressant. One sent me home with a Xanax prescription. 
This leads me to go through flair ups with no medicine. Which leads to ER visits where they pump me full of saline and phenergan. It's hell. Here are the most mind blowingly stupid things I've been told. By doctors. 
""IBS can be really painful. Have you tired this diet.?"" If I had a penny for every diet I've been on....
""Are you sure it's not menstrual blood when you wipe?"" What. The. Fuck. Yes I'm sure.
""Anxiety can cause you real physical pain. Up your Zoloft 25 mg."" Yes I'm aware, but I have control over my anxiety. This is not pain from anxiety.
""You're stomach ulcers are from you over medicating on NSAIDs for your period."" No. Just. No. I have endo but am careful to not over do the ibphrophen.
""A colonoscopy is an procedure that we want to avoid unless we have to...let's put you on probiotics."" Those do nothing for me. Why? are lower endos dangerous?
""Mid 20s is a stressful time, have you seen a counslor."" Yes bitch I have a regular therapist who begs me to see a stomach doctor.

Let me be clear I have mental health issues. I've been on antidepressants since I was 16. This is not the cause of my pain. It doesn't help my stomach/lower pain but it sure as hell not causing me to shit blood. 

I have had 2 upper endos., A million blood and stool tests, I am perscribed dicyclomine (which helps the cramps), see 6 doctors. Have 3+ ER visits a year. Stomach ulcers, a 3 day ER visit, and had my life derailed for 2 years.

I keep asking for a CT scan,and a lower endo. But because my stool sample doesn't detect blood they won't. I'm not sure why. Is it because I'm a meek looking 20 year old who has trouble advocating for myself? Idk. I'm just angry at this point.

598,Should i treat SIBO/Dysbiosis without being properly tested for it?,joshyowww,1,gh976x,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/gh976x/should_i_treat_sibodysbiosis_without_being/,1,"Sorry if you’ve seen me go off about this before, but just incase anyone hasn’t seen and can chime in with anything it would be so appreciated, Feel like there’s no one else to turn to! I need help, i can't let this ruin my life anymore, at such a young age. My main query is if i need to be tested by stool/breath test before carrying out any anti microbial protocols?

**SYMPTOMS:**

I’ve got a host of symptoms that look pretty related to dysbiosis/sibo, experienced the last 3-4 years (probably around the time i got cyclospora food poisoning and started taking lots of pro biotics (I’m 21 now):

Being bloated all the time with belly sticking out, Gut pain when consuming foods, Gut issues when consuming probiotics etc, LOTS of gas only when eating certain foods but definitely not always, Gas i do get is extremely smelly and same with number 2’s, i’ve got extreme fatigue/weakness, eczema/fungal acne/normal acne, Dry skin, Dandruff, Insomnia, Anxiety, Weight loss unless i’m eating LOADS of calories, Joint pains, Sexual function is not tip top for my age, Certain foods make my skin worse and Brain fog.

I’m not constipated (maybe a little strain), no diarrhea, All i know in terms of nutrition is my Iron is high which could show that i’m not having issues with the gut things robbing nutrients? I do have the H63D gene for accumulating iron (hemochromeatosis) but it’s not meant to be a high risk one and i’m only 21 so don’t think it would show this high this young (52% saturation). Not tested other nutrients for deficiencies.

**HISTORY:**

I’ve been on Anti-biotics like 15 times in my life (**flucloxacillin i believe mostly)**, the last time was last year when i went on clarithromycin in January 2019 for an eczema infection and even though my bowel movements are okay normally, they went amazing during taking the antiB’s, the stools were properly formed as opposed to now when their skinny/small so i don’t know if that indicated anything? Also went on anti biotics mentronidazole for dental infection in april 2019.

I contracted cyclospora back in 2016 august in mexico (found from a stool test) which is a form of food poisoning from water contaminted with human feaces and i had very bad diarrhea for a while, faded away eventually and i started taking pro biotics which made it even better, carried on taking pro biotics for a while after that but gut was probably never the same after getting cyclospora. Doc never gave antiB’s for it.

Over the last 4 years i've completed a bunch of blood tests related to Thyroid/Testoserone/Lipids etc etc basically all the standard tests and they've all come back normal, actually have really high Test..

**MY DIET:**

Consists of: Beef, Chicken, Cod, Salmon, Liver, Collagen, Potatoes, Sweet potatoes, White rice, Oats, Dates, Grapes, Mango, Melon, Bananas, Apple, Honey, butter, coconut oil, olive oil, Nutritional yeast recently, Peas rarely, Dairy sometimes, and the may treat myself with chocolate etc sometimes.

I use cronometer and make sure i hit the daily RDA for all nutrients. I eat more than enough calories, protein, carbs, fat etc. I've cut out junk from diet for 4 years now.

I've been trying to bulk up the last few months so i may get nearly 4000 cals a day which is a lot (i'm 5ft9 70kg and skinny), This means i eat a lot of the food above.

**MAIN QUESTION:**

I know i was asking about the stool/breath test the other day but i’ve realised i really can’t afford them at the moment..(Unless you guys think its ABSOLUTELY essential, then i would find a way)..

Based on my history above and current situation i’m wondering if it’s worth going on a gut protocol like the antimicrobials without having any tests? I mean WHAT else could my gut issues possibly be if it’s not dysibosis?? If i was to do one, it would be the stool test as i know it can give a better idea of things than a breath test. But surely it’s just gonna tell me what i already know?

It’s prob pretty obvious i’ve got sibo or whatever, what different info could a stool/breath show me that could change how i approach it with protocols etc?

Has ANYONE attempted extensive protocols on their gut without being tested but having all the symptoms, is it safe to do this?

My thinking has been, isn’t it better to treat by symptoms rather than inaccurate tests? i’m just worried that i’m treating something i haven’t got potentially without having a test to know?????

**TESTING:**

If i was to do a test it would be this one in the uk: [https://invivohealthcare.com/gi-ecologix/?fbclid=IwAR04yY4yrNN7s4qhhbTU219ivYWpgJdxxUv-PXRsQtKtUj8R8kQnEUjIgds](https://invivohealthcare.com/gi-ecologix/?fbclid=IwAR04yY4yrNN7s4qhhbTU219ivYWpgJdxxUv-PXRsQtKtUj8R8kQnEUjIgds)

Tried relentlessly for tests from NHS but theres absolutely no chance from them, couldn’t even get me referred to **Gastroenterology, i really would struggle getting anti biotics from them too. They just say IBS. SO THE DOCS WONT DO ANYTHING, the only option i have is to take it into my own hands and pay all that money for a test :((((**

**POLL:**

Answer below if you don't have the time to reply to this thread..

Question:

Should i get properly tested for SIBO/Dysbiosis via Breath test/Full stool analysis before starting any anti microbial protocols?

Hello everyone!  

My name is Darren Reynolds and I am currently a Trainee Clinical Psychologist completing my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) at **King’s College London**. My colleagues and I are investigating the role of ‘psychological flexibility’, in the development of internalised stigma in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 

Some individuals with IBD are known to experience stigma related to their health condition and this stigma is sometimes internalised (‘internalised stigma’) which can be distressing and disruptive to their lives. ‘Psychological flexibility’ is a term that includes the ability to stand back from distressing thoughts (cognitive defusion), the ability to be able to stay in the here-and-now (mindfulness), being willing to experience distressing emotions (acceptance), and to do what matters despite difficult emotions and thoughts (valued committed action). 

This new study funded by King’s College London will assess whether ‘psychological flexibility’ may help to explain why some individuals with IBD end up internalising stigma relating to their health condition and others do not. We are collecting data by means of an **online anonymous survey** **hosted by SurveyMonkey** which is to be answered by any adults aged 18+ with a confirmed diagnosis of IBD. We would like to hear from everyone regardless of whether you experience stigma related to your IBD or not. After reading the information sheet and consenting to the study, the online questionnaire process will take approximately **25 minutes** to fill out - this can be completed on any computer or smartphone. 

This study has received ethical approval.

I just received my prescription for Lialda to treat my mild pan-ulcerative colitis. Wondering if anyone has experience or guidance on how you time when you take the pills? There doesn’t seem to be any recommendations as to whether they must be taken at the exact same time of day, or within the same 2 hours, etc. Have any of you felt any negative effects of taking them at different times of day? I’m not looking to alternate between morning and night or anything, just wondering how much wiggle room I can expect to have without my body freaking out. 

Thanks!",2020-05-13 23:59:02

Wondering what your experience was like growing up with IBD? The pain of the disease is one thing, but I fear that she’ll encounter mean kids who tease her because she uses the bathroom too often, or her feeling scared to use the bathroom in public places especially school afraid that someone might make fun of her. She loves to be active, I wonder if she’ll be able to play sports on a field that might not have a bathroom available. I worry about her sleeping over her friends houses and the possibility of her getting in an embarrassing situation. Then there’s dating, I hope she doesn’t feel insecure because of all this.

Background:
Colic since birth, chronic constipation until she reached 3.5 years old and had three bouts of c diff over the course of two months, hospitalized over it was so severe. Then there were about 4 months of great stools but then starting a month ago she’s been having frequent diarrhea, pain, mucus, bloody mucus. Then she has days where she’s pretty ok. Goes back and forth. Her calprotectin level while on vanco was 16, two weeks ago calprotectin was 145 and we’re sending another stool sample this week to continue to check her levels. I’ll also add since being hospitalized she has a lot of anxiety, we’ve been able to calm her fear for the most part but because she associates pooping with pain she gets nervous when she has to go. Myself or my husband has to hold her hand while she whines/moans and sometimes cries from the pain. It’s heartbreaking. No known food triggers, she’s basically dairy free and eats very healthy for a kid her age. Drinks non dairy kefir with floraster mixed in and a little benefiber per her gi doctor. No medicine changes nothing, just one day a month ago things started to get wild.",2020-05-18 00:48:37

All started with noticing some blood in the toilet bowl last Sunday after a heavy squatting session. Went to see the doc. He said probably that.

Was very nervous all week. Had no other symptoms. Until Friday night. I did strain a bit this BM, Noticed a decent size chunk of mucus in the bowl separate to my stool. (Mainly whiteish/yellow)
And a tiny bit of blood in the stool.  Went and see doc and she said not to stress unless I see blood again. She also gave me a rectal examination which she said was all clear.

That same day I started to take metamucil just as I thought it would help. And every day for the last month I have been having a smoothie made of berries and lots of fruit (3+ pieced) daily.

I also started on anxiety medication friday night. And ever since this night I have been experiencing constant stomach dull aches/rumbles.  NO BLOOD thank God.
Theres A small amount of mucus in my stool most times I pass..
Constant feeling of need to go to deficate. Even tho when I try sometimes nothing comes out may be a little bit of mucus at times.
Somewhat burping (lump in throat) (may be anxiety or the pills)
Have been waking up in middle of the night to poop.
Have noticed undigested food in my stool lately too which I've never ever seen.  (Seeds and tomato skin)

I'm honestly so stress out. Does this sound like a form of IBD?


The symptoms all came on at once too. That's a good sign it's IBD and now cancer yeah?


P.s my nan had colorectal cancer diagnosis at mid 70s. I'm worried it might be in the family? But she isn't a first degree relative so apparently it doesn't matter?

Please help. I'm honestly so anxious. Thankyou

I'm new to this group, as I was diagnosed with UC 2 weeks ago. I'm on mesalazine right now and it's, till this point, working out pretty good.

I do have a question about fiber in foods. As you guys know, before a colonoscopy etc. you have to eat low fiber foods. They told me one of the reasons is so the intestines don't have to work that hard. It got me thinking, would it be better to eat low fiber food at all times, not just during a flare? I know fibers are known for being healthy but maybe that's different for these chronic diseases? 

I've had my first flare 2 months ago and during that time I ate a lot of high fiber foods. Like 3 times a day. 

I was wondering what your experiences are?

I've been snooping around this forum for the past few days because I'm starting to go crazy lol.

I feel very alone in this. :( **Sorry this post got long, but if someone could give some advice - I would be eternally grateful.** I know this is the job of my doctors, but my family doctor and all the specialists I've seen have been very...*dismissive* of me. :/

Here some background:

I'm a 24 year old woman, turning 25 soon. I've been having digestive issues basically my whole life, but they got much worse when I started university (most likely due to stress?). My main symptoms are constipation and what I think is acid reflux.

The past few months however, I've been having A LOT of pain. Like, way more than usual. I've developed a high pain tolerance when it comes to my digestive problems, but this new pain is bad. I spent most of this May in tears. I had to go to the hospital earlier this month (which is not the place to be during a worldwide pandemic lol). Nothing showed up in the x-rays, ultrasound, or the blood test. In the past I've done blood tests where my blood count was very high but no one did any further investigation?? Also a colonoscopy I did 2 years ago showed inflammation, which my dr only told me about last week?? Aren't both of these results concerning?

Here are my usual symptoms:

* very bad constipation (I know that most people with IBD get diarrhoea tho)
* INTENSE burning from throat all the down to intestines
* feeling like I'm about to burst, even when I don't have constipation??
* weird, tight feeling in abdomen
* burning in butthole (sorry tmi lol)
* fatigue
* red mucus in stool
* my face heats up sometimes like I'm developing a fever

Could this be IBD? I know it's sometimes difficult to detect these conditions. If anyone has had similar experiences, please let me know. It could be something else, but I'm tired of my doctors dismissing me and telling me it's all in my head. The pain is so bad.",2020-05-27 00:53:33

* stomach cramps first the morning (relief after BM)
* thin stool, but mostly loose either way - sometimes with mucus
* loss of appetite in the evenings
* random bouts of nausea
* tiredness and lack of energy 

Here are the tests that I've taken, if this helps.

3. Lactose Intolerance - negative

Long time lurker, first time poster. So the last 12 months or so have been a roller coaster with my disease. I was diagnosed back in 2011, have been on a few different medications. Long story attempted to make somewhat shorter.. my medications stopped working around this time last year so we stopped them, I had a small laprascopic resection and new meds were started. I started on a low dose of Imuran back in October and we slowly increase my dose every other week until Jan, did a repeat colonoscopy and determined I need to be on a biologic as well so I started remicade in January. Remicade has my disease symptoms mostly under control and I’m definitely on the upswing with that. Beginning in April, I started getting mouth ulcers and some lesions along my fingernails that we tried a few treatments for over a month and they weren’t working so I went to the ER as a last resort when it got so painful In the beginning of May. Well we found my white count was REALLY low and the dermatologists found out I had Mycoplasma Induced Rash and Mucositis (MIRM). I was taken off the Imuran and we treated the mycoplasma with a z-pack and that heard everything up just fine, however my white count is still below normal, although improving slowly. Over the last few weeks I’ve really noticed a lot of hair loss. My hair is now about half it’s thickness that it used to be. I had some mild hair loss back when I first started the imuran but it stopped about a month into taking it. Has anybody had issues with hair loss because of being taken off of Imuran, starting remicade, or because of a low white count? I’m trying not to stress about it, but losing half of your hair volume, especially as a woman, is emotionally very hard and I’m just looking for any kind of hope or help.

I phoned the doctors and the hospital and they told me that due to the current pandemic, unless I'm physically dying, nothing will happen until the beginning of August. All I want is to be seen by a gastroenterologist so I can be treated but they told me that they aren't doing any tests unless the patients are critical until then.

I really don't know what to do, and I'm really, really scared. The only time I hadn't felt like this was when I was in hospital overnight when I collapsed and they gave me Prednisone (at least I think that's what it was called, I am not sure). This was the only time I had felt normal in the past two years, but I only took it when I was there. Even when I got home I was full of energy and felt myself, and my appetite soared. But after that, it all went downhill again and now I'm back to this.

Every doctor I've spoken to have told me it's some form of IBD but they told me they can't treat it properly unless I have a camera put up there to check. My faecal calprotectin levels are currently over 2400 and they're still telling me the same thing. I really don't know what to do...",2020-05-27 20:59:27

I was diagnosed in January and did three months of 9mg, which totally resolved my symptoms. Then I did 2 weeks on 6mg which seemed to be okay, but then symptoms returned when I went to 3mg. My doctor told me to go back to 9mg until symptoms subsided (which took a few weeks) and then to 6mg; but after about a week symptoms returned again. I have a phone call scheduled with my doctor tomorrow but I'm just feeling frustrated. The more research I do the more it seems like this is pretty common and I'm just not sure what this could look like long term. Thankfully my only side effect at this point is mild heartburn so that's pretty manageable, but I know I can't be on this dosage forever (right?).

Just wondering if anyone has had any longer-term success. There just isn't a ton of info out there about microscopic colitis so I would appreciate any insight people might have. Any stories, good or bad, are welcome!",2020-05-29 02:24:50

The doctor suspects it could be IBD but they put me on a cancer referral since I also had all the symptoms of that. (But highly doubtful since I’m only 20)

This all started when I noticed A LOT of bleeding from my bum. (I’ve always had a tiny bit and never thought much of it) but this time it has been literally dripping down (TMI SORRY) and turning all the water red in the toilet bowl.

Additionally, I’ve always been chronically constipated, but I started passing loose stools and that’s when I was like hol’ up, something’s weird is going on here. (6 months later and I’m back to chronic constipation, but take laxatives everyday)

I’ve had a lot of time to think over these months and I can’t help but feel like what if it turns out just to be piles? Or an anal fissure? And I’ve wasted everyone’s time in thinking that it’s IBD or cancer.

686,Vent about work and chronic illness,floshoboo,16,caiq37,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/caiq37/vent_about_work_and_chronic_illness/,7,"I'm becoming more and more convinced that work hates me for having a chronic illness. I got told I have the best performance on the team. They rate competencies and objectives on a 5 point scale, 3 is average and I'm at a 4. But because I'm off sick sometimes after being in hospital they said it's only fair to mark me down to a 2.5 - 3. This is despite the fact my volume of work I get done is the same as my coworkers who haven't had time off. 

I work in a place where most workers work from home and there's meant to be the option to work from hom flexibly but in my team not so much. When I have diarrhea and ask to work from home my manager pushes back for the first few days and makes me take time off sick when I could be working then eventually asks when I'm off sick if I'd like to work from home. 

They pay 75% of your salary for sick pay, but they want to stop paying me anything so working from home would be the best option for me. 

They said me working from home puts extra pressure on the team and they can't cope with the volume of calls so I asked my manager to check how many calls came through that day and it was 2....so....one per person? This is not a slow day, there can be days where the phone doesn't ring once. 

Regardless, if I ever work from home now I take the general inbox, we usually take it in turns but even when I'm in the office now I take it. Which is actually a huge amount of work so they all benefit from it.

On top of this, I think part of the reason I have been having trouble recovering is because I have a coworker who was verbally harassing me, but when I tried to talk to my manager about it she dismisses it as him being autistic. He literally said to me that he can't believe I've gotten through like without killing myself and that he's only nice to me now because I recently got out of hospital. Btw, he's not diagnosed with autism but he is aware everyone in my office thinks he has autism and I believe he uses it to avoid responsibility for his actions.

My manager has the audacity to ask me could there be anything at work that's impacting your flare-ups?  Maybe the way you guys handle everything? She even asked me if I had caused my own flare-up by not eating healthily. I do eat healthily but I've put on weight and have a puffy face because steroids and I eat my lunch away from the office now so she doesn't believe me lol. 

I'm just so sick of this, it's bad enough that my coworkers are so incompetent that me being at 75% capacity operates better than they do. But now I'm being punished for the fact I'm not there enough to carry the team, even though I am struggling to do all my work and also take on their extra tasks to compensate for a day off here and there. 

I just feel like I need a few weeks off, but I never ever take a sustained period of time off because they talk me out of it. I've had two doctors notes I've not used and it still isn't good enough for them. And now they are saying if I take extended leave they won't pay me.",2019-07-08 11:11:48

I found that many patients were particularly concerned about the exact causes of their cancer and wondered whether the same causes could provoke the development of another cancer or could provoke a similar cancer for the people around them. So I decided to create an app to adress those concerns!

The aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. This includes IBD. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any medical or personal information to us or any other party.

To be clear, the app is **strictly educational** and all information contained within **cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician**. It is aimed at the general public, to clarify exactly what causes cancer and give some idea which risk factors have a larger or smaller impact.

The app is called 'Cancer Risk Calculator' and is available for both Android and Apple devices. If any of you would like to see the effects of a condition on the risk of cancer or would like to calculate your own risks, please feel free to try it.

I questioned her about the past diagnosis and my symptoms, she ignored my symptoms and said she didn’t know about the past as she didn’t have the details in my notes (bullshit). She said she was discharging me and I should come back “if I lose weight without trying”.  

Fortunately in the mean time I have been referred to another hospital for a second opinion.

**TL;DR: My boyfriend's doctor isn't a specialty chron's doctor and keeps giving him stupid advice and won't listen to him when he says he in pain. The prednisone does nothing and we need a new dedicated gastro located somewhere in Long Island, NY.**

Long story short...My boyfriend has Chron's and he is currently on 1 injection of Prednisone monthly.

He still is in daily excruciating pain and it gets worse each day, he has daily bloody stool, and he has mass amounts of pain still. It's affecting his sleep, it's affecting his skin and hair. etc. He is still unable to get any nutrients from food and is consistently losing weight and has crazy mood swings. \[He's 6'3"", 110lbs. from 180 lbs. since he started Prednisone\] They also found cancerous cysts in his colon and have not done anything about it since they found it in February.

So he has only seen 1 doctor for treatment in NY \[he was diagnosed at 15 in California\] However, the doctor he is seeing is not a specialty Gastro and some of the things she says makes me very skeptical if she actually knows what she is doing when it comes to Chron's.

Can anyone recommend a good Long Island, NY Gastro specifically focused on Chron's treatment?

Also, side note. The same doctor told him diet and nutrition doesn't matter, so he has been drinking soda and eating crap like burger king chicken because he says it makes his stomach feel better. But he gets sick again anyways. I made him bring a diet journal log of his crap food habits and the doctor straight up told him he was eating perfectly fine.",2019-07-30 21:24:36

I'm an almost 22 year old male. I had my first colonoscopy back in January for my initial IBD (UC) diagnosis. I get very regular blood work/stool tests. They're usually done about every 4-6 weeks by my gastro. I'm on Humira as of recently, along with 20mg of prednisone. I just did a calprotectin test and some other blood work. My doctor saw this stool test https://i.imgur.com/CRdsrJR.png and was not happy. He urgently ordered me to do another one, to which I begrudgingly obliged (I really dislike doing stool tests). The next test came back even higher https://i.imgur.com/svwOvZO.png. In conjunction with my elevated white blood cells in the blood work https://i.imgur.com/Ot55r7x.png, he decided he needed to do another colonoscopy on me.

However, I don't feel as if I'm in a flare up, that's what's strange to me. I just realized though, that both my calprotectin tests were done in the toilet--not a separate plastic vessel or something. I really hate pooping into a plastic bin, so I figured as long as no urine gets in the test, I should be good. Nope, google tells me I definitely needed to make sure the poop never touched the toilet water. Now I'm just mad at myself because it's possible my test results were inaccurate because of that and I just got myself another damn colonoscopy that I don't necessarily enjoy doing. However, the blood work looks a little strange (although apparently WBC tend to go up on prednisone?) 

What do you guys think? Did I fuck up and sign myself up for another day of fun with a colonoscopy, or was pooping into the toilet fine and I definitely need the 2nd colonoscopy? By the way, I haven't told my doctor this, I'm writing this post literally right as I realized I may have fucked up lol. I have a feeling that even if I do tell my doctor, he would still ""make"" me do this colonoscopy just to make sure the Humira is working (in conjunction with the blood test that is still be resulted that helps tell if my body is breaking down the Humira or not).",2020-10-01 19:31:50

I had 16 biopsies taken from all over my bowel including my appendix opening; however, ever since I've had constant bad stomach pain of which I hadnt experienced before the procedure, the pain is to the right side of my belly button.

Has anyone else experienced this? I figure it's from the many biopsy sites, however I wasn't wasn't warned that I'd be in pain for days following the procedure?

I been having suicidal thoughts everyday since day 1 and I just simply think its not worth living.

758,Could this be Crohn's,PurpleMermaid16,12,j6vc2t,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/j6vc2t/could_this_be_crohns/,2,"Hey guys, I'm working on being diagnosed with what the doc thinks is Crohn's and was wanting to see what you guys think?

I've been having stomach/GI issues since 2015. In 2015, I was constantly nauseous and had some right sided abdominal pain. They did a bunch of blood test and an endoscopy, which were normal. They said I had IBS, and I went gluten free, which helped huge (they said they ruled out celiacs for me). I had this right sided pain intermittently, for a while, and then in summer 2016, It was really bad for like a week (they randomly cleared up). They said they ruled appendicitis, and did a colonoscopy which they said was normal and said it was just IBS. 

In the years since, I sometimes get this pain (always in the same spot) but it has always just gone away in a few days or weeks. I will also sometimes just throw up when exercising and some other GI symptoms.

Flash forward to this summer, I have been progressively getting worse with this right sided abdominal pain, which aggravated when I eat and gets worse throughout the day. Middle of August, I talked to my primary care doc, who said that didn't sound like IBS and they started doing more tests. All blood tests they have done are normal and they said they noticed some inflammation in my jejunum in an MRI, but yesterday I got results that a capsule endoscopy looked normal. About 3 weeks ago, I started prednisone which helped but as I started to taper off, the pain came back (I just went up on my prednisone dose).  Doc still suspects Crohn's and wants to do more testing he said a CT scan of small intestine and then a balloon endoscopy. 

What I'm wanting to know is could this be crohn's if all these tests are coming back normal? Is more testing worth it, because it's been a lot and frustrating to hear normal when I don't feel normal? Could it be something else? If it is ""just IBS"" would I feel relief from predisone? Also, if I have had crohn's for years, could that explain right sided abdominal pain that comes and goes? Would a Crohn's flare resolve on its own if that's what I have been experiencing?

Back in August I was diagnosed with UC after basically a year of being unable to do anything, multiple sprints to the toilet each hour, the whole deal. I started prednisone and Balsalazide and my world turned around in two days flat. Now I’m eating super carefully when I’m not having my famous willpower slips (but still eating very healthy when I do, just maybe some inadvisable things) feeling way better still but I’m worried that with the weaning off of the prednisone I am getting some symptoms creeping back in. 

My doctor wants me to try taking Metronidazole (an antibiotic) for two weeks after I reported that coming off of the prednisone I’m getting increasingly gassy and bloated. He says it’s a narrow spectrum antibiotic that will target any SIBO I might have. I’m extremely wary of antibiotics and aware of their overuse.

After 10 months of pestering doctors, sending off multiple stool samples, a Calprotectin test being delayed because my GP failed to order it, several blood tests and a horrible trip to A&E where I was accused of trying to swing an emergency colonoscopy, I have FINALLY had an appointment with my consultant and have been booked in for a colonoscopy next Thursday, one week's time.

Problem is, now it's suddenly become extremely real almost overnight (consultant appointment was only on this Monday just passed), I'm now extremely nervous and scared, especially regarding the bowel prep. Had a brief conversation with the endoscopy dept nurse this morning where she ran through the instructions. 

I have to take half the Moviprep at 5pm the previous evening, then the other half at 7am on the day of the procedure, it's at 330pm. I've read a few horror stories here and elsewhere (stupid I know but I was searching for anecdotes and came across more than I bargained for) where a few unlucky souls had 'accidents' in various places, or their treatment was delayed/rescheduled because the prep hadn't fully worked it's way through. 

Can anyone give me some advice/tips on how to make sure the entire process goes as smoothly as possible, or try to alleviate some of my worries? In all honesty I was not expecting things to suddenly move so quickly after almost a year of what felt like stalling. I can't take anyone with me for obvious reasons, which makes it all the more nerve-wracking.",2020-10-08 21:00:31

In about June I started noticing significant amounts of blood in my stool, this then progressed through the months with abdominal pains and mucus/jelly like stool and diarrhoea. My GP have been pretty fast with referring and dealing with me with multiple bloods and stool samples and eventually got urgently referred to the gastrointestinal department.

Around September most of my symptoms started to get less and less evident, and was still getting tests done from my GP such as ultrasound ect. They noticed my liver bloods were slightly abnormal at this point and asked me to stop drinking completely (don't often anyways). It was around this time I developed a sore hip, that can really get rather sore. 

Fast forward to now, I had my colonoscopy at the end of September and it seems that the left of my bowel looks like crohns and the right looks like UC. I have extensive amounts of very small ulcers, and my bowels are inflamed. My stools have been improving a lot (only going a few times a day, and blood only present every now and then). My hip pain has been coming and going but is still there, and im experiencing ulcers in my mouth every few weeks. But apart from that? I feel completely normal and apart from my hip I feel great and not really effected.

At the latest hospital appointment where he talked to me about my colonoscopy results, he told me that my biopsies are leaning towards crohns disease. But after talking to me about how I feel, and that I feel very well, he says I am too well for treatment. Because I seem to be slowly improving that seems to contradict the signs that I may have crohns disease as someone with crohns disease cant just get better on there on and generally feel unwell. The only thing bothering me at the moment is my hip pain which during all this, and im slightly worried about my liver but my GP thinks this is related to my bowels. 

The next steps for me was more bloods, more stool samples and im going for an MRI soon.

To get the point, I feel like I should be happy that im slowly improving without treatment and don't require it according to my doctor but my hip is still sore and my liver bloods is slightly abnormal and I cant help but still feel so so anxious about it all. I struggle with anxiety as it is and this whole experience has been the worst as I have such massive phobias surrounding health, doctors, needles ect. I think this is more of a vent, but I would like to know...

Has anyone experienced IBD symptoms and slowly improved?

Hip pain and being related? (I haven't injured it in anyway)

I've been getting a lot of little boils in my inner thigh, some on my tummy and one on my tail end. Is this a symptom?

I'm just a very anxious and worried 21 year old that hasn't had anything health related happen to them until now.

I've been struggling with some gi issues, biggest complaint is ride sided abdominal pain.
My doc suspects crohn's, but I've been given a lot of tests that say ""normal"". Mri showed signs of inflammation in my jejunum. Colonoscopy, endoscopy, and capsule endoscopy were all ""normal"" , also all blood tests that they have done, idk all those. 
Now doc wants to do a ct scan and balloon endoscopy, but I'm getting really sick of tests. I feel like a lab rats and it's hard to hear a test is ""normal"" when I definitely don't feel normal. 
I'm on prednisone at the moment, which has helped huge and I'm working on tapering off. I'm also working on diet things to see how that helps. 

My question is how big of a deal is an exact diagnosis anyway? If I am feeling better after the prednisone taper is done, will they even do anything different with treatment? What are typical treatment options for mild crohn's? I feel like if I have crohn's it's pretty mild because I think if I had some complications it would have shown up in these tests?

So when I got out of college and entered the workforce I start drinking coffee..a lot of coffee. Sometimes on an empty stomach and I feel like this is where my issues began. In the morning I would normally have runny bm and noticed sometimes blood when I wiped from the amount of diarrhea I had. Ive since cut out coffee and made sure if I do have it I have a good amount of food in my stomach before hand. 

However, I have noticed since then wild changes in my bowel habits. Schedule is random, colors change wildly, and the consistency has firmed up but stays relatively soft. But it seems like a soft tan has dominated the color and it still feels acidic. I do take a small amount of metamucil every few days because my job doesnt allow me to pack a decent lunch with fiber (usually in the deep woods or top of a mountain) which could explain the tanish color.

A little background: I had Crohn’s/UC for 10 years, flared most of the time, tried every drug, lots of steroids, etc, and they eventually failed. I have a permanent ileostomy now and have been in remission and medication free for another 10 years! Yay!

However, I do have a lot of complicating factors with any illness now due to my IBD, pervious surgeries, and drugs taken. I am an unusual case, like many IBD patients. I feel I need a very thorough and thoughtful doctor for this reason. 

My first GI was AWESOME and I felt that he really knew me and my situation/needs well. Then after I had surgery, he retired. I found another GI, though I only go once a year for checkups now. 

In the last 2 years I have been increasingly disappointed in her care. She seems very nice but the office seems a little disorganized and as of my last appointment, I was very frustrated when I realized I was telling them (nurses and doctors) things they should have looked up in my chart before they met with me, such as my reason for my visit, bloodwork results, repeated DXA scan results, etc. Many times I have witnessed them going through bloodwork results for the first time as I am sitting there.

I can’t help but feel frustrated and like just a number. Am I right to feel annoyed? I feel like I want to find another new GI. I am a unique case and I would appreciate 2 minutes of prep before I meet with them.

Background: very little physical activity, but no change in diet for the last few months. I eat regular home cooked food.

Issue:

Although  there has been no change in my lifestyle or diet for the past 6 months,  I've had a stingy, burning sensation in the anal area while passing  stool for the last 4 days, with varying intensity on each day. The  burning sensation persists for a few minutes after passing the stool as  well.  
I've also noticed blood in my stool for the last 4 days. It's  bright red. I would characterize the sting/burn as a multiple point  sting. Almost feels like multiple points of the anus are on fire.

I've  tried incorporating more fluids into my diet, started drinking more  water and incorporated more vegetables into my eating routine for the  last 2 days now.

What could be the  cause of sudden onset of such situation? I've done some googling now,  but the answers vary from IBD, Crohns, UC, hemorrhoids, and so forth.

Took NSAID for a week (Which gave me the same symptons I'm having now) and went to the ER which diagnosed me with Bacterial infection (??). After taking some antibiotics I got better but had a bunch of tachycardia and got a unberable back pain that wouldn't let me walk or sit. I was diagnosed with cervical hernia which made me bedrriden for 1 month and half and when I got better I started to have a lot of diarreah (15x times a day) with mild pain, caused by incomplete bowel movement. 

Currently:

- I did blood tests, stool tests, stool culture and fecal occult blood and everything came back clean except that sunddenly I was lactose intolerant.
- My colonoscopy showed I had a mild longitudinal enanthem throughout my left side of my colon without exudate. That was the only abnormal thing there. The doctor who performed the colonoscopy was in a such bad mood and told without even looking to me that it's probably Ulcerative Colitis. But I heard that the Prep, NSAID and even IBS could cause this. So I'm hoping he's wrong. (I still have to wait for the biopsy)
- The endoscopy I did today unfortunately came clean as I was hoping to be diagnosed with some gastritis or ulcer. Even my doctor had prescriped me some PPI to me before, thinking that I had gastritis.
- My nausea episode only appeared 3 months ago, when I took the NSAID and once a week afterwards. (but it was really mild). But then, 2 weeks ago, I had some psyllium husk and this nausea started to become chronic. (It was one of the worst episode...I only got relief after evacuating a lot of mucus - like 2 white balls of mucus - )

Honestly I feel lost and extremely anxious/sad because I still have to wait for 2 weeks for the results of my biopsy  and I'm dealing with fear and constant nausea in a way that I can't concentrate or do anything on my day. I can't enjoy a conversation, I can't work or do chores, I can't play or watch something without losing focus because of the discomfort. I'm afraid it could be cancer or Crohn's along with UC (since I feel like my nausea and fullness comes from some bowel obstruction)

I feel so alone because nobody seems to be taking serious how crippling is my problem and 2 doctors already told me my nausea is all from my head. :(

Does anyone have some clue on what's happening to me or had some similar symptons like mine? I honestly would love if it was some sort of IBS, because at least I'd feel some hope to find a cure....

Edit: After a month, I don't have diarrhea anymore, only loose stool. 1-2 per day. Maybe because I cut gluten, lactose, followed FODMAP and etc... my main concern is the intense nausea.",2020-10-18 09:35:54

I am wondering if others have experienced this side effect or symptom. Thanks.

<edit> Apparently, after a colonoscopy with anesthesia, it is also possible to have brain fog for many days after the procedure due to brain hormone interference.

No bowel obstruction, perforation or abscess. Findings more compatible with mild left-sided/distal colitis. Continued follow up may be helpful for correlation as clinically warranted. Mild non specific fluid which may be physiologic.”

Alright so, I had a flexible sigmoidoscopy a week ago. Doctor saw mild hyperemia in my rectum but my left colon is completely normal. So he took a biopsy from there, here is the result:


> ""In the colon biopsy material, prominent lymphoid follicle structure in the lamina propria to the germinal center and minimal edema and moderate cell infiltration in the lamina propria were noted. Morphological features are nonspecific and it would be appropriate to evaluate the patient in the light of clinical data. No specific properties were observed in histochemically applied Alcian Blue staining. ""

So my doctor told me that I don't have ulcerative colitis, and the small bright red blood that I saw/small rectal bleeding could be due to temporary anal fissures that heals quickly. He advised me to drink a lot water, and not get constipated. As for hyperemia in rectum, he said it is probably due to the enema that I used before the procedure.

But anyway, I'm still worried. He also told me that if you see any mucus (like bloody mucus) in stool, come back to me. Though, at that time I wasn't seeing it so I said I wasnt seeing. But today, when I had a bowel movement I saw a mucus in my stool which made me worried. It wasn't bloody though.

860,IBD or IBS confusion.,LibrarySeveral,10,jjmu0x,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/jjmu0x/ibd_or_ibs_confusion/,10,"I’ve had bowel issues (tolerable and not severe)for years now however I was constipated during pandemic time, going to the toilet once every 2-3 days.

My main symptoms over the years have been consistent and have not worsened.

Symptoms:
- Stomach Ache (no pain at all just uncomfortable), A feeling that i really need to go poo.
- I feel 100% better and relieved after pooing, no more stomach discomfort.
- sometimes used to have poo that stings rectum (no blood)
- I’ve never seen blood in my poo once
-  and sometimes constipation.

I saw my doctor a couple months ago who gave me a stool sample which they said found very small microscopic amount of blood in poo and calprotectin of 1000.

2 weeks later I took a blood test which showed normal CRP below 5.

After this I changed my diet and take a probiotic everyday and all of those symptoms have gone, haven’t had a stomach ache in months, I have a BM every morning, however when i poo i feel incomplete evacuation but after i leave the toilet i don’t feel it anymore and feel normal for the rest of the day.
Also i’ve rarely had diarrhoea over the years but my point will be log shaped and soft. 

one GI told me my symptoms could just be due to an infection and my symptoms aren’t severe enough to be crohns.

Also another GI booked a colonoscopy saying there’s  50/50 chance they find colitis. 

I personally don’t think i have IBD because my symptoms lead more towards IBS. It’s the calprotectin that’s scary as i don’t understand why that’s raised.

What do you guys think? thanks.",2020-10-28 13:30:51
861,Colonoscopy found potential Crohn’s - but I don’t feel like my symptoms are severe enough! (24F),tdp0506,9,jjm5pp,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/jjm5pp/colonoscopy_found_potential_crohns_but_i_dont/,35,"Hi, I’m looking for a bit of advice in terms of a potential diagnosis (I’m 24F for reference). For the past 6 months I’ve been experiencing mild-moderate stomach symptoms (they are an inconvenience and have stopped me from doing some activities, but I wouldn’t say they are debilitating or “life-ruining”). These symptoms have included: 
- persistent stomach aches (generally 4-6 nights of the week) 
- constant bloating (id say I’m more often bloated than not) 
- urgency to pass stool but not physically being able to pass anything 
- occasionally I will experience very hard stools, followed by reasonably loose stools 
- blood in stools - it is generally quite a bright red and happens once every few weeks 
- low vitamin D, B12 and iron levels
- pain/pressure when trying to pass a stool (hard to explain but feels like it’s *there*, but I just can’t push it out). 

My Aunty has Crohns so after trying a low FODMAP diet and still experiencing symptoms, I was sent to have a colonoscopy to check that it wasn’t IBD. I went in feeling very confident that I just had internal haemorrhoids or something easily resolvable. 

After the procedure, the dr said that he found both inflammation and lesions in my small intestine. He took 4 biopsies and said that he is fairly certain I have Crohn’s disease. I asked whether it could be anything else as I didn’t feel like my symptoms were severe enough to warrant the disease, but he said there wasn’t really anything else it could be as the lesions heavily suggest that it is Crohns. He said that I could’ve potentially had a reaction to the bowel prep laxatives, but it was unlikely. 

Has anyone else experienced these types of symptoms? I don’t find out my biopsy results until Monday and I’m quite anxious as to whether or not I do have Crohns. Has anyone had a similar misdiagnosis?

I got out in 2000, and other than the initial problems that brought me in, where they identified I had PSC and UC, it had been mostly dormant for many many years.  I got my transplant in 2012, and since then, I've been plagued with more and more abdominal pain.  In fact, I was on pain meds longer than I should have been, and they just told me it was addiction or phantom pain.  I've had some C Diff issues in the past 3-4  years, and eventually got a fecal transplant a couple of years ago.  I'd say over the last year or so, my abdominal pain has been more and more constant.  I used to wear a compression garment because it helped with my discomfort.  The pain spreads to my back, and I always just assume it's because of pressure.  I realized recently when I started wearing the compression garment it was making my back pain worse, almost like it was pushing in my abdominal distention, and thus making my back hurt more.

I have infusions for Entyvio my GI doc started a year or so ago.  Without seeing me, my GI doc prescribed Prednisone 20mg, and then pretty straight into a taper after a week.  Within 24 hours, I felt much better.  As I got down to 5mg, that week the pain really started to come back, and so he pushed me back up to 20mg, and I felt almost immediately better.  I had a colonoscopy after that, on Sep 11th, and they said other than previous scarring, there was zero sign of inflammation.  I did the taper again, and felt bad at 5mg again, and then have felt terrible since.  I thought I was going through prednisone withdrawal, and might have been, but I'm still doubled over in pain.  In the past week my GI doc started me on Uceris to try and help, no change as of yet.  He also started me on Hyoscyamine yesterday, but it hasn't seemed to have any affect either.

Does anyone have any ideas?  I've had pancreatitis once (I don't smoke or drink or anything), and the pain in my abdomen and back is approaching that at times, but not quite at that level of pain.  They did blood work the other day, and things are more or less normal.

What else could be causing my pain, that prednisone almost instantly fixes the problem?  I am basically unable to work, as it's really hard to focus with all this pain, and I have a mild headache that comes and goes in severity for weeks, along with it.  Hopefully I didn't leave anything out.  I'm 42, male, let me know any other info you want, or if you have any ideas.",2020-10-29 16:29:13

889,Temporary suspension of Lialda,Ridolph,6,exf7v8,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/exf7v8/temporary_suspension_of_lialda/,3,"So a friend of a friend has been prescribed Lialda for a few years following an infection that caused pancolitis. It is not clear and has never been resolved that this triggered either Crohns or UC. There have been no further flares, though the damage was done during the infection and there are many polyps as a result and a long recovery. All inflammatory markers are where they were before the infection - that is to say unremarkable. Two gastric drs. choose to treat it as crohns and can’t seem to really deal with the details that don’t really fit either. The Lialda is more or less to prevent cancer. (Note that Delzicol was horrible, and Apriso neutral). Thus there is no evidence that the Lialda actually does anything.

Recently the generic for Lialda came out (before that the ‘generic’ was just the same pill as the real stuff), a larger and different pill, and for him it doesn’t seem to be equivalent, and may be causing gastropareisis. 

The main question here, besides a request for any info that might assist, is how dangerous is it to stop taking the generic Lialda altogether for a few months and see what happens? The drs are useless. If he does in fact get a flare, can he just start taking it again or would/could it actually cause damage and set-back? (Though again, the whole thing goes back to a one-time infection). 

As an aside, are there other treatments that might be considered equivalent? Like curcumin + CBD or other formulations?

And has anyone has issues with the new generic Lialda which is not from Shire? (It is Mylan)

And are there any good gastros in NYC? So far he’s batting 0 for actual ability to diagnose outside the box, and the infection was rare thus outside the box. It’s like they are programmed by the FDA.

Since last summer I have been taking imraldi (adalimmimab) injections and I find that they have been really helpful - I'm honestly the best I've ever felt.

However, at the same time I've picked up so much more of an appetite and a love of food (as I used to associate food with being ill and my appetite was really bad so was always very thin) and I've been rapidly gaining weight - I've moved up about 4/5 dress sizes in the last few months.

My doctor says that this is common among patients who are starting to become well again, and it should sort itself out soon, but at the moment I don't feel very good in my body and it's really affecting my self esteem, mental health, etc. 

Does/did anyone else feel this way when they started to feel better? How did you deal with this?",2020-02-04 09:53:23
895,My past few days with UC,bestasiam,9,ez7h3l,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/ez7h3l/my_past_few_days_with_uc/,6,"I just wanted to write this all out to people who understand. 

My first UC flare landed me in the hospital with pancolitis, but my presentation was usual and it took over a year, 2 colonoscopies, and a sigmoidoscope to get an actual diagnosis. Since then I’ve burned through Mesalamine (oral and suppository), budesonide, 6mp, and got pancreatitis from Imuran. I was on prednisone for months and became steroid dependent until they put me on Remicade. That worked, sort of for a few months, but it was giving me significant tachycardia at each infusion and then my symptoms returned. 

Finally they put me on Entyvio and I started to feel better, except for the week of joint pain. But I was able to deal with that. Then I started having symptoms before my next 8 week session, they switched me to 6 weeks, then to 4, and I noticed that in the last week of the cycle I had great energy and felt better than I had for a long time. But it took three weeks of pain and exhaustion to get there. It started to affect my mood, so the doc pulled me back to the 6-week cycle at the end of last year. I made it to 5 weeks before I had a weekend of bleeding and pain, but it kind of resolved and then went away after infusion. 

And that brings me to this week, the second 6-week cycle. I didn’t even make it 4 weeks post infusion. It hit me hard on Sunday, fever, no appetite, stomach pain, diarrhea. On Monday it got worse and the bleeding started. Monday night was agony, the pain, the nonstop bathroom visits, and it was all blood. I had hardly eaten for two days and I knew I needed help. 

I called the oncall GI at 4am, who said I should come to the ER. I couldn’t even imagine getting into the car at that point so I took some Bentyl and rested for a couple hours while the spasms calmed. Tuesday morning I spoke to my GI who reiterated that if I was still in pain and bleeding (I was), I should go in for labs and imaging. 

I waited for four hours in the ER waiting room. I made many bloody deposits in their porcelain sacrificial chamber. At one point they asked me to wear a mask, because of my biologic, they said. Turns out my blood test showed another surprise. 

My white blood cell count is way, WAY low, neutropenia low. For the second time this year. And they have no idea why. They got me back into my own room, hooked up to fluids, and drew huge vials of blood for cultures. Everyone has to wear a mask around me. They take me for xrays and CT scans. They take blood again. And again. They take stool (aka bloody mucous) and urine samples. No CDiff!! And they can see the colitis on the CT but otherwise no answers. 

They admitted me and moved me to a room later that evening and began to administer massive amounts of antibiotics. Multiple bags of four different types. And the resident GI comes in and says “I want to start you on steroids because you’re only passing blood. Oh, and colonoscopy tomorrow, so continue not eating.” I’ve had no food today and barely any the past two days, but stomach cramps make me lose my appetite. 

After the steroids I start to feel good, they always work quickly for me. No more cramps or bathroom visits. But now I’m hungry. Meanwhile, they are coming in for vitals and to change my antibiotics every 30 minutes. It’s impossible to rest but I feel wired even though I didn’t really sleep the night before. 

And now it is 5am. I have had 6 bags of antibiotics, and have 2-3 left. One shot of steroids and one more to go, four blood draws, including one that wouldn’t stop bleeding. A reaction to one of the antibiotics, which thankfully subsided on its own.  And I’m kind of ready to go home to my little girl. And some food. At least I don’t have to do prep!

It’s been a long few days and we aren’t done yet.  They don’t know when I’ll be released, it depends on the scope results and if my count improves.  And I expect I need a new biologic. My GI has been talking about Humira but it makes me nervous for a few reasons, mostly that I’d be administering it myself and I react strangely to medications. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you for taking the time. I’d love to hear any advice. I wish you all remission and many good days!",2020-02-05 11:15:01

I was diagnosed with UC just over a year ago. Since then I’ve been on asacol. I was still having symptoms on and off and my inflammation markers were higher than they should be. So yesterday my GI decided to move me to Imuran, while keeping up with the asacol for now and a short course of cortiment.  I totally  understand the need to get this disease under control and this is just the next step. BUT I’ve basically been crying since yesterday lol.   
I’m slightly worried about the side effects of this drug - both short and long term but I know I’m in good hands and watched closely. It’s just so much to deal with and I feel like this just makes it so much more ‘serious’ if that makes sense. I also feel like a bit of a failure that I couldn’t get this under control myself with the first meds and diet or something. I’m just so frustrated that this will always be a thing - it will never truly go away.

Info about addressing psychological & emotional stress is an important gap in resources for us people with IBD that is informed & indicated by the research.

My intention is to continue to create & share info about this topic for the community.  Full disclosure that I offer an online course for people with chronic GI problems to learn mindfulness but I honestly am not trying to spam or advertise as my main priority with this & future posts.

I personally have had Crohn's for 10+ years & am a licensed clinical psychologist, not some douche trying to make some quick internet money.

If information alone was sufficient I would stop there, but it's clearly not sufficient to change your relationship with stress & build stress management skills. It requires practice to build skills, hence the course.

I’ve dealt with this before and saw a GI for it when I had non-stop diarrhea for around 6-8 months. This was probably three years ago and fell right in between my two pregnancies. At that time they couldn’t decide what it was and ordered a colonoscopy. I barely made it through the prep (really wound up quitting it a bit early because I was getting so nauseated from the fishy aftertaste), and after the procedure the doctor said I was constipated (who knew?!) and had lymphocytic colitis. They tried to get me on budenoside (sp?) but my insurance rejected it entirely, and they wound up telling me I should just go on Imodium for relief and that was that. It seemed to resolve itself eventually and life went back to normal. 

Fast forward to January. After a heavy couple months of decadent indulgence (read: eating all the holiday cookies), my husband and I decided to lose weight. We kicked this off January 2nd and almost immediately my diarrhea came back with a vengeance. I had a new GP at this point and went to her when it was three weeks on. I gave her my background and she decided I must be dealing with LC again so ordered some tests done and sent me home with a prescription for vancomycin. 

Fast forward to this week and the meds have really only eased the intense stomach cramps but otherwise had no effect. I called the GP and learned they got my stool sample back and it wasn’t LC after all. So they’ve referred me to a new GI (the same one my mom sees, actually), and now I wait. 

I really, really, really don’t want another colonoscopy. The prep was one of the worst things I’ve ever dealt with and I dread having to do that again. But my guess is I’ll have to in order to figure this out. 

Anyway, I just wanted to vent a bit to people who understand. It may not be IBD, but whatever it is, it’s really frustrating and interferes with my quality of life right now.

I was starting to get sick and feel the symptoms about a years before I was diagnosed. I didn’t go to the doctors for a while bc I figured it’d just go away (lol) but when I did finally go, the doctor wasn’t the best. I was checked for piles, discovered I didn’t have piles and was given treatment for piles. Looking back, it both makes me laugh and angry bc I could’ve been saved a lot of trouble if she’d done her job properly and listened to me when I said to her that there’s something wrong *inside* me. Never mind. 

Later, things didn’t get better so late I went back to the same doc but this time with my mum who was ready to fight. I explained my symptoms again and my mum did it as well, giving a few more details. The doc said something about acid reflux and gave us some meds. I was given this liquid medicine which did help cool my stomach down but not my bowel (I was burning up in both places). I stopped bothering to go back bc I felt like nothing was working and the doc didn’t care. I suffered thru. 

Eventually, it went away by itself. I’d lost *a lot* of weight and had become so weak, I could feel my life starting to slip away. It was around that time that I started getting better and could eat again so I recovered. I thought that was it. Ha!

A few months passed, I realise I hadn’t had my period for about 2-3 months (can’t remember exactly) so went back to the docs (not the same one this time lol no way) and was referred to gyno to see if all is good. The gyno did a blood test and sent me on my way. About a day or two later, my phone blows up but I didn’t realise as it was in my bag. So my house phone blows up but no ones home. Eventually my mum got a call and she ended up giving the phone to me. It the gyno telling me I needed to go to the hospital *now* bc I was down 3 pints of blood and was dangerously close to heart failure as a result. Sooo I did lol

The hospital confirmed I had dangerously low levels of blood and I had to have a transfusion. I was down just over 3 pints. From there, the hospital launched an investigation to see what made me lose so much blood. Finally, I was diagnosed with an IBD. Ironically, about a week after my diagnosis, I flared again and had to be hospitalised lol.

I elected for surgery and on the 12th Jan 2016 I had a subtotal colectomy to remove my large bowel. Since then things have been great, no more pills! 
Fast forward and I’m now in my final year of university at Liverpool John Moores, with hopes of being a dietician in the near future and helping people with various illnesses including IBD.
As part of my final year I have to complete a research project of my own, so I’m hoping some wonderful people on here could give me a hand. It’s a four question survey that focuses on what people with IBD eat and why? Do you follow any specific diet? Where do you go to get your advice? Feel free to write as much or as little as you like. There’s a ton more info on the study if you follow the link, as well as my official uni contact info if you have any questions. Don’t hesitate to ask! Also if you just want to ask me on here about my own experiences with UC, or what it’s like to live with an ileostomy I’m happy to chat.
Anyone who wants to take part must be 18 and living in the UK. Thanks for reading everyone and I really appreciate any help you can give.

Sincerely
A fellow pooper

My mom (75 y.o.) has been sick since early to mid-September. She’s not had any previous bowel issues, that I know of. She’s always been fairly regular and would sometimes get stomach upset, like everyone does, but nothing out of the ordinary. After I hadn’t heard from her for a while, she called me to tell me this (rough) timeline of what had happened:

-Went to her primary care doc with severe anal pain; was diagnosed with anal fissure.

-She passed out in her bathroom at home, having had an “explosive” bowel event, with lots of blood.

-She went to the ER and had a hemorrhoid lanced. My dad said it looked like a war zone.

-After release, she went to see a surgeon. She passed out in the doctor’s office and was admitted to the hospital, where she had a blood transfusion.

-She went home and continued to have a lot of blood loss and explosive bowel events.

-She went back into a different hospital, where the doctor told her the only problems they could see were hemorrhoids and a tight sphincter. She had an MRI that showed, according to my dad, some type of infection, which they believed could be diagnosed by colonoscopy. Continued to have explosive events.

-Before she could have the colonoscopy, the hospital discharged her and sent her to a rehab facility.

-The rehab’s doctor took one look at her, said “You never should have been discharged,” and sent her to a bigger hospital, where she promptly received two more units of blood.

-After 2 days of dicking around, the hospital finally gave her a colonoscopy and biopsies.

This is when I flew out to see her, because I was freaking out.

The doctor gave us the wonderful news that the biopsies showed no evidence of disease. No cancer, Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis. Just diverticulitis and hemorrhoids, which he said were probably exacerbated by dehydration and malnutrition (she wasn’t eating very well and has lost ~40 pounds). She also has 7 ulcers in her colon, so I specifically asked about ulcerative colitis. He said no. She’s anemic and has low potassium and has been receiving supplements. The only other medications she’s on are Lidocaine and Hydrocortisone creams. 

They discharged her to a rehab facility on Tuesday so she can recover and get her strength back. Despite giving her stool softeners, she’s been a bit constipated since the colonoscopy. They also gave her instructions to follow up with the colorectal surgeon in a few weeks. He may give her a CT to look for, I guess, other evidence of Crohn’s?

What concerns me is her pain. She is in so much pain she can barely sit up in bed to eat. Any time she moves, she winces and sucks in her breath, and unless she’s received pain pills recently, it’s usually at a 7-9. They tried to put her on a sitz bath while I was visiting, and she lasted about 1 minute before she was begging them to put her back in bed. After that, she just sobbed because she was in such excruciating pain. It seems no better than it was a couple of weeks ago. Everyone’s assuring me that the hemorrhoids and ulcers can just be THAT painful, and that she just needs time to heal, but y’all, I just can’t shake the feeling that they’re broad-brushing it too much. 

Does any of this sound familiar to anybody else? Anything we should ask the doctor about? I’m at a loss, and I don’t want to put her through any more than she’s already been through, but if I can prevent this from ever happening again—or if I can give her some ideas to get past this right now—I will do it. Thank you so much for reading this novel.",2019-11-07 19:29:14

I've been dying the past two years, not to be dramatic or anything. The long short is I got real sick, lost lots of weight, got a camera jammed up and down me...

And then my gastroenterologist...died. 

So I've been in limbo, waiting for another. 

I tried SCD but couldn't move past the intro without flaring. Fair, okay. Next logical step was full carnivore. 

The first month was so so so beautiful. I was flat, stools were great, energy was up. After that though, despite no change - I started, uh, bloating. But this isn't like, *Oh, I ate too much.* This is, *I have a basketball and three babies in me* bloat. 

I've persevered. I stayed with it for four more months. 

Now we're onto month five. I'm not quite sure what to do anymore. I can't get medication, but it isn't so bad - I'm just swollen up all of the time and in so much pain it hurts to breathe. 

On the off chance it might be parasites, I downed some pinworm stuff yesterday. Eggs came out of me. I went to the doctor. I am back to waiting. 

Medical care here takes years, really. 

I'm debating on just adding in some safe IBD-Aid foods or switching over. I'm at a complete loss, but I really can't function this way. I'm tired, I'm weak. I'm in so much pain.

*I'm in so much pain.*

Zerocarb does wonders for some people. I suppose I'm just unlucky. It was going well. I had periods of ups and downs. 

But this is - bad. Everything is bad. Everything hurts so much. And I guess I'm just scared. I don't have a gallbladder, so maybe it's some weird bile issue. 

But I just wish I could see a specialist already. I hate this. I hate wasting my life in an agonizing limbo. 

I don't know. Guess I'm reaching out for advice. Anyone done carnivore and it didn't work? Any diet ideas to keep me relatively okay until I go? I still have months to wait and I just wanna do what I can. 

I know sensitivities vary. I think I'd ultimately be safest with low-residue foods, or congee, maybe. Vegetables are off of the table, though. I haven't found one that doesn't kill me. 

I'm sorry if this was long. I don't really get to talk to people about shit like this.",2019-11-18 21:37:45

I have colitis and because of that developed fissures quite a few years ago. We lived in a small town, I feel like my doctor's didn't take it seriously. I was told I had three that were quite severe and was given Nifedipine. They did not resolve. During this time I had two kids and also developed hemorrhoids. When I finally approached my doctor I was told the two issues were just a part of childbirth and to deal with it. The doctor specifically said, ""It's not even that bad, it could be worse."" That was a very shameful moment and I've been dealing with it on my own for the last two years. We finally moved to a larger city and I have scheduled an appointment with a doctor specializing in colitis and fissures but it's not until the end of December. 

I'm just so frustrated. I will be so careful, wipe extremely gently, do warm water treatments and over a month or two it seems like they'll get a little better. But then, if I have a flare or even wipe a little too hard, boom! They break open and the blood, INTENSE itching, and pain start all over again. I can't ever get ahead

The itching, oh my gosh, and then the intense, throbbing pain following an opening. I just can't. It's ruining my life. I don't know. I do know it could be worse but for me, in this moment, it's having such an effect on my quality of life. And I'm having so much shame surrounding it too...

For other people who have symptoms and peek through this sub like I did, I'll add my story.  I hope it helps someone.

About three months ago I went through a very stressful time at work and started to have diarrhea.  It sometimes got better for a few days but it never went away.  After about a month of it, I went to a GP and they did stool tests and blood tests to look for common parasites and diseases.  All were negative.  I got a second opinion and the other doctor gave me an antibiotic to be on the safe side but both recommended that I go to a Gastroenterologist.  So I did.

It took a month to get on her schedule.  And she was the first doctor I could get access to in my network.  So while waiting for her appointment, I noticed the first blood in my stool (Just a little.  I've never had more than just traces of blood) and pain started in by lower left abdomen.  And like most of you, I was concerned about colon cancer among other things.  I've had a mild lymphoma before so I had an oncologist to discuss my case with and he felt that it wasn't likely to be cancer due to so many years of clean CTs and blood work.  He also recommended that  I see the Gastroenterologist.

The GE doctor listened to my symptoms and then suggested a probiotic and fiber supplement and scheduled me for a colonoscopy.  The first colonoscopy opening was also a month away.  My symptoms have slowly progressed since then, moving from one or two movements per day to three or four.  Blood is still traces, but more frequent.  My appetite has come and gone and come again and gone again.  The colon pain went away, or moved around.

The colonoscopy showed mild, friable, inflammation throughout the colon and nothing in the small intestine.  She took a lot of biopsies. 

Now, I'm getting ready for the next step and hoping for a successful treatment.  My appointment is Monday and it can't come soon enough.  Of all the things that bother me now, I'd say the worst one is that I just don't feel like eating.  I'm also worried about long term liver or kidney damage, even though I know that's a much lower probability.",2019-11-28 22:19:07

I was first diagnosed with Crohn’s in 2009. Since then I have been on Remicade and humira. Remicade worked wonders- I was in full remission -which probably made me a little cocky- and I decided to switch to humira so I could study abroad in college. Humira has been anything but great for me. I had my typical Crohn’s symptoms return within a year of starting Humira (lots of blood in my stool). Also, about 25lbs of weight gain, which was surprising as I was fully in remission before starting new treatment. I’ve held out for 4 years, increasing my humira to weekly injections as suggested by my old GI doc. Eventually, my old GI doc wasn’t really listening to me anymore and I found a new doctor.

My new GI doc is awesome. She thinks I potentially have a misdiagnosis of Crohn’s, and that I actually have UC. Obviously the two have similar treatment, but I’m excited to make sure I have the proper diagnosis moving forward. She’s also suggesting different treatment, which I’m eager to start. She wants me to try Stelara or Entyvio. I like the idea of injecting stelara at home, but I’m not opposed to the short infusion time of Entyvio. 

Anyone have insight here? I mostly want something that will work (naturally!) but not have crazy side effects or cause me to gain weight like humira did.

-BMs that are pure mucus at times... Sometimes the mucus looks maroon... Old blood?

-Very yellow BMs

-literally lost control of my bowels a few times.

Hi all,

I posted about this survey around a month ago and got quite a few responses from Reddit so just wanted to raise some more awareness! **King's College London** are currently recruiting for participants **aged 18+ with a diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)** to take part in an **online survey** exploring why some people may internalise stigma related to their IBD. This online study involves completing some questionnaires about yourself, how you manage difficult thoughts and feelings and how you feel about your IBD.

The survey can be completed on any computer or smartphone at the following link:

[**https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/YR6JNSG**](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/YR6JNSG)

This will take around **25 minutes in total** and you can enter a prize draw to **win one of ten £15 Amazon UK eGift vouchers (or your country's equivalent - e.g. $15 Amazon voucher)**.

It would be *amazing* to hear from as many people as possible! We would like to hear from anyone who meets the criteria in bold above, regardless of whether you experience any stigma related to your IBD or not. Please feel free to share with anyone you know who meets the criteria.

**Thank you so much for your time!**",2020-08-05 00:08:02

I hate that it took so long to find good care, but once you find someone who is genuinely interested in helping you restore your quality of life, it is all worth it. 

Find someone who has experience with your specific condition - they will know the kind of questions to ask and will be able to recommend treatments others would not have thought of. Find someone who actually asks what your ultimate goal is and develops a treatment plan based on those goals. Find someone who will not leave any stone un-turned while trying to get to the root of your problem. Find someone who treats you and your condition like a unique case and not just another example out of a textbook. Find someone who takes the time to listen to YOU and doesn't try to rush you through the appointment to get to the next patient. They exist, I promise, just keep looking.

1025,Can a colonscopy detect Ulcerative Colitis during remission?,Eliebarbar,12,i3dmky,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/i3dmky/can_a_colonscopy_detect_ulcerative_colitis_during/,8,"Hello! I'm gonna keep this short. As a child, I always had stomach issues. When I was 15, I had a complicated case of appendicitis where my appendix burst and I had to get two surgeries, one in April and the other in August. The April one cleansed my body and the August one was for removal. The following summer, I went through a stressful time in life and I developed a gnawing inflammed pain on the left side of my body that runs down to my sigmod colon and it can be so painful sometimes. I went to doctors for years and did every test you could think of. They finally referred me to a GI specialist after having elevated igA levels after testing for celiac. which came back negative.

I think I'm just worried that they won't find anything because I've been chasing my tail for 4 years trying to figure out why I have this inflammation in my colon. I'm convinced I have ulcerative colitis or crohn's, but the issue is, I don't show the typical symptoms. My symptoms the first year were intense pain in that left side of my body that would even inflame my ribcage, plus an acidic stomach and intense nausea and anxiety then progessively I would go through periods where my symptoms would improve and I would feel fine for the most part and then it hits me out of nowhere and I start to go through another period where my symptoms come back. Lately, I've been experiencing dizziness after eating, charley horses in my gut, intense heart palpitations, brain fog, lethary, extreme fatigue, anxiety, sore eyes, sore/inflammed pain on the left side that comes out of nowhere, spreads to my back and ribcage and it's sooo intense but only lasts a few seconds and it's like once a day, intense cramping that lasts a few seconds rarely, pain where my appendix was taken out, and I think very minimal blood in my stool. As far as bowel movement, I will go to the restroom up to like 5 times a day and a lot of times, it'll be like 2-3 times back to back in the morning.

I just read all of these IBD stories and people tend to show much harsher symptoms. My symptoms tend to vary a lot, even by the hour. I remember 2 weeks ago, my left side was so inflammed that I was  getting tailbone and hip inflammation and I couldn't handle the pain! Right now, I'm still not feeling great but it wasn't as bad as the first year pain wise, so I always question if this is remission (just because I don't have intense pai). I just don't want to wake up from my colonscopy and endoscopy and be told that they couldn't figure out the issue. It could still be celiac I guess. Hypothetically, if I am in remission, would they still be able to diagnose me if I have ulcerative colitis or crohn's?",2020-08-04 07:36:59

I have been holding on to an IBS diagnosis since 2018, and have some intractable symptoms that don’t fit IBS at all. Also, I have never responded particularly well to any IBS treatments even after trying pretty much all of them over the last 2 years. I’m 27 years old.

IBS-like symptoms: I have chronic daily diarrhea, abdominal pain, gas, bloating for 2 years. I have a history of depression and anxiety managed through therapy primarily. 

Non-IBS like symptoms: bad night sweats, pain is more debilitating (can’t work as much), nausea/vomiting, burping constantly, waking up early to vomit or have diarrhea, and a rash/bruising/ulcers on my legs that I have been told by GI and family doc sounds like erythema nodosum, joint pain including TMJ back pain and shoulder pains, 20-25 lb of weight loss than I can’t regain

HOWEVER I get kind of frustrated because I have had the following normal tests:
-upper abdominal ultrasound normal
-colonoscopy and biopsies were normal
-CT scan just showed fluid around my upper abdomen, but I was told there wasn’t enough fat to properly view my small intestine
-fecal calprotectin was “normal” but no one can see to find a record of the value because I had it done in March when Covid first hit
-all my bloodwork has been normal including iron etc. Only ever had a vitamin D deficiency which has now been corrected

I have a new GI now who wants to do a MRI of my small intestine and a gastroscopy (although I’ll be waiting a while because of COVID). 

Anyone have similar symptoms to me and can offer any advice? I honestly am so tired of not knowing if I have IBS or IBD. At this point I’m willing to accept either one if it means I can get the right treatment! Thanks everyone.",2020-08-05 14:02:34
1031,Diagnosis paused - what now?,ItchyScallion,13,i427ii,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/i427ii/diagnosis_paused_what_now/,2,"Doctors back where I used to live kept dismissing me over my complaints of blood in the stool, diarrhoea for days or weeks on end, dramatic bloating, some vomiting with blood, bad stomach pain and cramps throughout. I've even gone to A&E for severe combinations and been laughed out as a grown ass woman without being examined because it's 'just a period' (??). At 18, I was also diagnosed with internal piles.

Before the outbreak, I started going to a private gastroenterologist. He became very quickly irritated looking at what I'd reported to other doctors so many times, and actually took the time to listen (Goes back to another post on here about finding a good specialist!). 

Blood tests were run on me as well as a few physical examinations, and all that was found was bowel inflammation - and that the vomiting with blood was probably down to ulcers from taking so many ibuprofens to manage the pain. I stopped, and that helped the vomiting!

A colonoscopy and gastroscopy to check everything were scheduled for April, but then the outbreak happened and that was put on hold until further notice. Still, nothing is available.

I have periodic episodes of bad pain, painful (and urgent!) diarrhoea that's sometimes bloody, and really insane bloating.

Definitely not looking for a diagnosis here, but just wondering if this is familiar to anyone. Even if I don't have IBD after all, it's nice to share some of these experiences with at least another human being! ^.^",2020-08-05 11:29:28

abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea since he was 12 years old. He has lost over 30 lbs and experiences joint pain (at times, his jaw is so inflamed that he has difficulty chewing), chronic prostatitis, severe headaches, chronic fatigue, insomnia and neurological symptoms including lightheadedness. He has seen multiple gastroenterologists over the years and has yet to receive a proper diagnosis. Here is a brief overview of his medical history: 	

-Tested positive for Epstein-Barr virus and diagnosed with mononucleosis at age 12

-Diarrhea and general gastrointestinal distress started shortly after bout with mono

-From the ages of 10 to 19, made multiple trips to the Caribbean and consistently contracted food borne illnesses, causing diarrhea and nausea

-At 25, he went to the ER with severe abdominal pain, fever and vomiting. They find a high WBC count and elevated amylase and lipase.

-At 26, he sees a gastroenterologist who finds the following clinical aberrations:

    * Blood test: Amylase and Lipase elevated 

    * Fecal Calprotectin: elevated

    * Gastroscope: Minimal focal acute duodenitis

    * Colonoscopy: Normal

    * Tested negative for Celiac and Ulcerative Colitis 

    * CT enterography: Normal

    * MRCP (MRI of Pancreas): Normal

    * Igg4: Normal (on the high end) 

-At 29, he sees an ENT due to difficulty breathing through his nose. The ENT finds:

    * Mild sinus pressure

    * Upon physical examination - sinuses appear to be inflamed

        * No known cause

-At 29, he sees a urologist for his chronic prostatitis. The urologist finds:

    * Microscopic hematuria (consistently)

    * Enlarged, inflammed prostate on digital rectal examination

    * Prostatic expression has bacteria

    * Many bacteria found in urine 

    * He is given an oral antibiotic that he cannot tolerate due to his GI issues and does not complete the course 

-At 30, he sees a rheumatologist who finds:

    * Low creatinine in urine

    * Elevated IgA 

    * Low red blood cell count 

    * CRP normal

Recently, a capsule endoscopy was performed on him and there were no remarkable findings.

Another interesting thing to note is that he was diagnosed with G6PD deficiency and hemolytic anemia by a naturopathic doctor.

My husband is on a gluten free diet and avoids all fibre as it causes him to have more frequent, loose bowel movements. 
We are at a loss about what our next steps should be.  He is planning on taking the test for SIBO within the coming weeks.  Is it possible that SIBO is responsible for his condition? We are looking for a grand unifying diagnosis that will account for all of his symptoms, but we have yet to encounter a physician who will investigate his medical issues in a holistic manner.  If anyone has any suggestions about what tests we should do or a possible condition that you think he may have, we would really appreciate it.",2020-08-07 19:24:09

1045,Please Help!,ShelbySnake88,4,i6tnq7,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/i6tnq7/please_help/,30,"Hi I am 31 and I feel like my time is running out.

I have been battling with stomach and gastrointestinal issues the past 3 years with no hope. Every doctor and gastroenterologist I’ve visited in Toronto hasn’t been able to diagnose me. They often down play my symptoms or continue to misdiagnose me. I even have had doctors walk out on me. I feel like the medical system here has given up on me. I am hoping you can help me.

My symptoms include extreme constipation, major bloating, frequent bowel movements, and a feeling of burning in my abdomen at times. I have at least 5-6 bowel movements a day, it’s as if the body is trying to empty out some kind of bacteria or parasite from within. Most bowel movements involve a little amount of stool and I need to strain extremely hard. I have excess gas and feel full from eating little food.

I constantly walk around with a large bulging stomach from bloating which is extremely noticeable. I often wake up in the middle of the night with the need to have multiple bowel movements which seriously impacts my sleep and mood.

This all started in 2017 when I living at a university dorm. I was using a shared kitchen, utensils (gross I know), washroom, and living room with other students. Shortly after a few weeks of living there, I started to have extreme urges to both urinate and defecate. I visited many different family doctors and three gastroenterologists who were of no help.

The first gastroenterologist I visited performed a colonoscopy on me. He said that my colon was a bit twisty which may be why I am experiencing these symptoms. Both the second and third gastroenterologists I saw said this finding is irrelevant. The second gastro just gave me laxatives with no possible clues as to what is happening. The third gastroenterologist suspected it could be SIBO and gave me antibiotics for it. Unfortunately the treatment did not help my symptoms.

I have done multiple blood tests, stool tests, a breath test for H.Pylori and urinate tests. All of these tests were negative. The only extra test yet to be done is an endoscopy with an examination of biopsies. I saw an urologist for the peeing problem, he did a cystoscopy and said my bladder had a minor infection. Luckily with antibiotics the frequent urination problem has been relieved which still leaves me with the stomach problem.

I have been prescribed all sorts of different laxatives from the gastroenterologist which include Constella, ClearLax, Senekot, and Dolculax. All of these medications help a bit to facilitate some of the bowel movements but it isn’t a long term solution for the underlying problem.

It may be worth noting that I had an H.Pylori infection when I was 14 years old and faced similar symptoms. At that time, I took antibiotics for the bacteria and was able to eradicate it. My brother also had this bacteria around the same time. I do suspect this could be the cause of my problems given the nature of living in a dorm and sharing utensils etc. However, all the tests are still coming back negative which has been puzzling.

As result, all the gastroenterologists I have seen are unable to diagnose me with anything and they resort to identifying my symptoms as “Irritable Bowel Syndrome.” I find this hard to believe since I have lived a very healthy and active lifestyle during and prior to this problem. This is includes eating healthy and fresh food while going to the gym 4-5 times a week.

I hope that you may please put me in touch with someone that can help me. I have struggling with this problem which has affected my career greatly as I can no longer work a regular 9-5 job. The stress and sleeplessness has also deteriorated my marriage with my wife. I feel I cannot hang on anymore as it has damaged my standard of living significantly. Any help that you and your publication can provide will be greatly appreciated. I promise to return the favor and then some.

Second day the same thing kept happening, but in the night I woke up with lots of pain and after applying pressure I just felt gases moving and the pain went back to being minimal. Third day just felt mild pressure in the area and took a laxative before sleeping because I’ve been a bit constipated (going daily, but not releasing much), but at night I woke up with sudden pain in the lower middle/right abdomen that didn’t felt like gas and pressing didn’t help, but only lasted like a minute.

1057,In urgent need of advice/a friendly ear,pancakelady2108,17,i9u73e,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/i9u73e/in_urgent_need_of_advicea_friendly_ear/,20,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this sub and really in need of some advice and just a place to explain my story. Just to preface, I'm based in the UK.

My gastric problems began about eight months ago, and they piggybacked off of a terrible flu I had that lasted a few weeks over the Christmas holidays and into mid January. It started as diahhroea with streaks of blood, a fever and stomach cramps which was diagnosed as gastroenteritis for which I was given antibiotics. The doctor at the time also suggested I had diverticulitis, an idea that has since been deemed ridiculous by an A&E doctor given that I'm only 32 years old.

After this, I decided to adopt a gluten free/largely vegan diet, and took up regular swimming. This hugely improved symptoms, I lost two stone and was feeling pretty good. I did a coeliac blood test which came back negative, however I had already cut out gluten for a over a week by the time I did the test, so there's a small chance it was innacurate. Unfortunately due to Covid, lockdown took its toll, I slipped off the diet wagon, was unable to swim for five months and gained another stone. 

During lockdown I had another flare of symptoms, for which more antibiotics were prescribed. Since then I have continued to have flare ups, and requested my GP make a referral for a colonoscopy, which they did, however it was just a routine referral, meaning an appointment is months and months away. I also did some stool samples, which came back as normal.

Fast forward to this week, I experienced an awful flare of symptoms two days ago at work, where I had horrific stomach cramps for hours, followed by explosive bloody (always red/maroon in colour) diahhroea. Over the last few weeks my symptoms have steadily worsened. I am constantly bloated, go to the toilet at least five times a day, every BM is soft/liquid with blood, and sometimes pencil thin stools, after eating the bloating worsens followed by horrific cramps before the inevitable dash to the toilet. Sometimes I pass little more than clots of blood, there is constant rectal pressure, I never feel like I have truly finished 'going', along with general fatigue/malaise and a gurgling stomach.

I called NHS 111 yesterday who told me to go to A&E, where upon checking vitals, doing full bloodwork and a physical exam, I was shocked to discover the doctor there could find nothing clinically wrong with me. Blood pressure, temperature, BPM all normal. Liver and kidney function normal, all cell counts normal, particularly haemoglobin which was slightly higher than average. This was deemed a good thing. Then physical exam also yielded nothing of any concern. The doctor seemed annoyed I was there, and even went as far as to suggest I had only gone in the hopes of being offered an emergency colonoscopy, which offended me considerably.

She did however suggest it was a good thing I had come, as it proves that whatever is going on, my body is coping with it well, which doesn't bring me much comfort to be honest. After a look through my recent medical records, she discovered that the stool samples I had done needed to be done again, as my GP had not ordered a faecal calprotectin test, something she described as the 'gold standard' for diagnosing IBD conditions, as it was astounding that this hadn't been done. She also wrote to my GP basically ordering them to change my colonoscopy referral to urgent.

I called my GP this morning to ensure they had ordered the new stool sample test, bumped my colonoscopy referral up to urgent, and to also request another coeliac blood test, since I have been eating gluten regularly again for a few months, so I guess it couldn't hurt to do the test again. 

Basically, I'm just wondering where on Earth do I go from here? I haven't been offered any treatment, and have been advised against anything to relieve diahhroea or wind incase it makes things worse. The blood and clots in every stool are increasing with every movement, yet it feels like because I am relatively young no doctor is particularly interested or concerned. I called NHS 111 again today due to going to the toilet three times in two hours just to pass several clots and little else. They suggested returning to hospital, however understood why I said no. The only advice they left me with was that if I started bleeding continuously, to the point where the amount of blood could fill a mug in two hours, or I am in so much pain I rate it a 9 or 10, then I was to go to A&E instantly.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2020-08-14 22:59:28

I'm tapering down off prednisone after nearly three months on it. Recently started Humira (took forever to actually get started due to an inconclusive TB test and wrangling with my insurance company). My doctor has me tapering down by 10 mg every two weeks. I was fine at 40 mg, fine at 30, ok at 20 (though my symptoms started to return), and then at 10-- BAM. Felt like I had the flu. Exhausted, sleeping 14 hours a day and still feeling totally destroyed, aches in my arms and legs, wrist joint pain, headaches, nausea, total loss of appetite. Have a call in to my doctor's office to ask if I can taper by 5 mg instead of 10 because I think that's the cause; I experimented by taking 15 mg today instead of 10 and I feel almost totally normal now and an hour after taking the prednisone the headache went away. 

Anyone else been through this? Do you usually taper by 5 mg or by 10 mg? Any advice while I wait to hear back?

I have been experiencing almost all the symptoms of colon cancer.,SnooCakes2354,9,ibamj6,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/ibamj6/27m_and_extremely_terrified_right_now_i_have_been/,10,"I'm so scared and anxious right now I can barely even function. My symptoms started 3 months ago when I ate some take out food one night. A few hours after eating, I suddenly felt stomach cramps and bloating, followed by nonstop diarrhea the day after. After that it changed to bad constipation that becomes worse as the days go by. I started having what looked like normal constipation with alternating watery stools. But 2 nights ago I forced myself to poop but what came out was short literally pencil thin stools. That is what terrified my the most because every search you make on the internet regarding thin stools always point to cancer. These are my other symptoms:

-nonstop belching
-sour taste in my throat
-feeling of something coming up my throat whenever I burp
-badly constipated, but when I do manage to go it's either loose and watery or short and flat/pencil thin.
-mucus in my stool, especially if it's watery.
-noticeable weight loss
-weakness
-loss of appetite

These symptoms have been going on for 3 months now with no signs of subsiding. In fact it feels like it's getting worse every day. The only hallmark colon cancer symptom I haven't experienced yet is probably blood in my stool. I've talked to some people with Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis and some of them told me that they had the exact same symptoms before getting diagnosed and it eased me a little. My grandpa also told me a story of him having a bad case of stomach pains and bleeding diarrhea back in his working days which sounded a lot like IBD, but he never got any official diagnosis because he had never undergone colonoscopy so he just kind of lived with it. I thought maybe my disease actually is IBD that I got from heredity after hearing that. But I'm still very scared because these symptoms feel much closer to colon cancer than IBD. 

I just want to hear everyone's opinion about this. Do my symptoms sound like surefire colon cancer or could it be something less serious? I'm literally losing sleep over this for a few days now. Seeing the thin stools really freaked the hell out of me and I've never been able to calm down since. I'm already scheduled to visit the GI tomorrow and I want to get a diagnosis so bad right now to give me some piece of mind. I am very, very scared right now. 😭",2020-08-17 11:01:56

Three years ago I started suspecting that food may be linked to my ever present brainfog, depression and loss of cognitive power. After desperately googling my symptoms trying to figure out what’s wrong with me, I’ve stumbled upon a forum post from a person that was facing the same issues. He proposed trying a diet comprised entirely of non-allergenic food. I have decided to follow his advice and soon my symptoms began to lift.

This was a long and arduous process, but I slowly managed to learn more about how some foods affect me. I had to keep a log of the foods I would eat at any given point and make sure to only introduce one new food at a time. It took about 1 year to figure out what my trigger foods were.

I soon figured I could perhaps make it easier for the next person dealing with this, so I came up with an app. The app is specifically designed to make detecting trigger foods as simple and intuitive as possible. To do this, I’ve added in a simple, but powerful mood tracker to the app, complete with a symptom tracker. The app will automatically correlate certain moods and symptoms with potential trigger foods.

Over time, I’ve taken advice from people and made the app better and better. The app now sports support for ingredients, allergens and a generous database of foods.

I've been having issues with my bowels for a few months but I'm struggling to get a diagnosis. Doctors aren't taking me seriously and the pandemic is making it difficult to get timely diagnostics.

My BMs are looser than they used to be - I have gone from smooth sausages resembling a 4 on the Bristol scale to - in general - a 5 or 6 (most BMs are quite mushy, but not full diarrhea). I have also noticed a significant increase in gas, albeit almost odorless gas. The occasional number 4 I do get is thinner and more fragmented than it used to be. I've also noticed that my stool is a lighter brown, sometimes floats and is very sticky (often leaves residue even after flushing). I haven't noticed any increased mucus production, either.

I don't really have any other bothersome symptoms. I have very mild rectal fullness when I sit down, but I have recently had suspected prostatitis and I also have a prolapsed hemorrhoid, which may explain this.

Systemically, I feel great. I have had no weight loss, my appetite is better than ever and all my tests have so far come back without any issues. I have had a full panel of bloods, c-reactive protein, coeliac and FIT tests. My GP was reluctant to do any stool cultures as apparently my symptoms aren't severe enough (things like c.diff would result in severe diarrhea, so I'm told). I'd be curious to do a SIBO and candida test, though. 

As things stand, my GP is going with a diagnosis of IBS, but I wonder if there's potentially something more sinister going on? I understand that - in most cases - IBD and the big C would result in some bleeding (I've never noticed any bleeding and my FIT came back negative). However, I wonder if it's worth pursuing a calprotectin test? Or would that likely return the same result as CRP? My GP inferred that CRP and calprotectin would generally return the same result, so doing both is a waste of time...I've read differing views on this.

Is it common for people to have IBD without bleeding, mucus and elevated CRP levels? I know the only sure-fire way to find out is through a colonoscopy, but I just want to gauge opinion from those with the condition in the meantime. 

Also, I understand IBD usually presents with abdominal pain - whatever my condition is, I don't have any pain at all. This is another reason I'm doubtful that my IBS diagnosis is correct given the primary symptom of that affliction is pain and discomfort. 

Thanks in advance!",2020-08-21 11:54:49

I’m here asking questions since I finally had an endoscopy & colonoscopy and they said I clearly have an IBD, but we will not be sure if it’s Crohn’s or Colitis and whether Celiac is involved after all, until the biopsies get back. Last scope was 2016, when they said they saw “nothing functionally wrong” and diagnosed me with IBS. Fast forward 4 years, symptoms have become debilitating in spite of greatly reduced stress levels, and this time they say “you’ve got a real mess in there.” (Tell me something I didn’t know, doc...)

I plan to call them with my list of questions Monday and hope I can ask them all but in the meantime if anyone who’s been through this can advise me from their lived experience I’d be greatly appreciative!

1. What does “Patchy cecal Colitis, Sigmoid-rectal active Colitis” mean?  Specifically “cecal”... googling has only brought up these scientific papers I can’t understand. 

2. I’ve had chronic constipation for my whole life. It became mixed with terrible diarrhea this summer when I started eating gluten daily to prepare for the Celiac test. (Which is why I think there must be Celiac) Everything I’m reading says Celiac and IBDs cause diarrhea, so what could explain the lifetime of constipation?

3. What is a diet that one in my situation should follow? Or does anyone know of GOOD resources online for how to eat and what and what not to take or do... lifestyle advice that really tells you what you need to know, tips tricks from people with firsthand experience, etc. Everything I’m finding online so far is this GENERIC advice that just isn’t helpful or really gives me any good idea of what I should actually be doing. 

4. [ETA] On the subject of eggs and oats - I’m reading in many places that they are both verboten in anti-inflammatory diets. AIP diet apparently says no eggs or oats. But then others including the IBD-Aid diet say to eat eggs and oats.

I have been flaring for a couple years (since the second trimester of my first pregnancy). I started Remicade last week and I'm already having milder symptoms. Amazing! I’m so grateful. My question is - how long did you wait to try to conceive after you started to be in symptomatic remission? 

One doctor I saw said that the formal recommendation is at least 3-6 months after a colonoscopy confirms remission. Another doctor suggested that simply being in remission should be sufficient. The literature seems consistent in recommending remission but not for specific durations.

I am really scared now. My IBD pain/symptoms aren't even that bad so taking a super painful medication is really not appealing.

Edit: Just wanted to thank everyone for their input. Although I'm still not feeling great about this, I do feel a bit better knowing it's not guaranteed to be super painful.

I went for 7 years in total remission with no medication after initial prednisone course, clinical and endoscopic. I've been having issues for the past 8 years. Was on Humira for 18 months but came off due to an ankle surgery and was off for a year and felt fine. Colonoscopy last February showed inflammation - even though I was't having symptoms - so had to go back on something. New gastro said Humira wasn't working as well as he'd like, so on to Stelara. It's been a bit of a roller-coaster, even though I feel good now, colon-speaking (no symptoms).

Here's the story:  I had my loading dose in mid-April and heartrate flew from 60 to 170 in about 30 seconds, got red and felt a fuzzy headed. They added Benadryl and Steroids and then slowly got the Stelara in. My doc wasn't really worried, but I was. Fast forward to mid-June and at-home injection. I had the same response, only milder due to less medication in the shot. I took a Benadryl immediately per doctor's recommendation, and eventually it calmed down. For my mid-August injection my GI doctor recommended taking Allegra for two weeks prior and 50mg Benadryl 30 minutes before - which I did. He feels it's a histamine reaction and not dangerous, but recommended this process to make it more comfortable for me.  I did the injection at my functional medicine doctor's office as he said he'd recommend having an epi-pen close by. All went fine and no issues, but I'm fearful that long-term it's not good to keep going. Also, my hair is shedding like CRAZY! It's worse the first 3-4 weeks after the injection. I have a colonoscopy set for 9/11 and if things are better, I'm going with what my functional med doc advises - try it with food and very specific supplementing. He's done a full workup on me - very deep dive - and thinks I may be able to heal naturally. After a ton of google searches - you really have to search - I found two very recent (2020) studies about people with this reaction: [April 2020](https://academic.oup.com/crohnscolitis360/article/2/2/otaa022/5818521?searchresult=1) and [June 2020](https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa115/5862862).",2020-08-24 14:52:58

For context, I'm in the UK and currently work in a restaurant kitchen.

I've been off work since Monday as a ""Covid precaution"". I started to get what felt like a cold, very sore throat, croaky voice, headache and things smelt strange. I was like...98% sure I didn't have Covid and that I was just run down from having one of my near constant flare ups from as-yet-undiagnosed-gastro-disease, but rules are rules, so home I went. Husband and I quarantined for 4 days in total, got our test kits in the post, and got the negative results yesterday evening. Hooray?

Not quite hooray. I'm in the process of getting diagnosed with... something. It's been 8 months and counting so far. I finally got an appointment through to see a gastroenterologist on 5th October (gotta love those NHS wait times), and my Calprotectin test came back as 'abnormal but expected', whatever that means. Don't have a Calprotectin number unfortunately, at it was a doctor's receptionist who gave me that information.

I'm probably gonna have to go back to work today or tomorrow, and honestly the thought fills me with dread. I work in a restaurant kitchen on the back line, and I am the only back line person we have. There are several issues with this. The first is that I am constantly being given 48 hours a week, which is far too many and is physically unmanageable for me. This is even after a conversation in which I said I can't do that many anymore. The second is that the front line chefs all have unbearable egos, and believe having to do back line duties are beneath them, which is why I end up with so many hours because they won't do the job in my place in order for me to have another day off. The third is that as back line, I am also in charge of potwash, which stacks up and becomes out of control during busy periods. Pre pandemic we had hired a potwash person so this wouldn't happen, but apparently the company has issued a hiring embargo for now incase we close again, so I won't be receiving any help any time soon. 

The general attitude where I work, at least in the kitchen, is that illness equals weakness. We only have six kitchen staff in total anyway, and one of them is already off due to having surgery, so that takes us down to five. I know that when I return I will be treated with scorn and suspicion, like I only claimed Covid just to get some time off, and that if I can't do the job I should just quit. I'm trying to find something else, not that there's much out there, but the stress of returning is making my gut worse so I don't know if I should get signed off for longer in the hopes my flare calms down.

This whole experience is making me incredibly depressed and anxious. The GP surgery have been utterly useless, and actually contributed to the process taking longer, as I had done some stool samples about two months ago, but they failed to order the Calprotectin test, and I didn't find out until about two weeks ago. It just sucks knowing that I very likely have some form of long term illness and nobody in my life actually cares.",2020-08-29 09:11:04

The guideline (and the synopsis) is intended for physicians (and as such are written very technically) and provide the general consensus on treatment approaches and the our understanding of the disease. I'm also told that guidelines like these are really important for insurance companies determining what they will pay for and for who. I'm not sure if I would say it's worth a full read for everyone out there since it's so technical, but it could serve as a tool to discuss with your doctor and/or insurance companies to help make sure you're getting the best care. Especially if your care is being managed by a family doctor or even a GI doctor who doesn't focus/specialize in IBD. JAMA also put out an accompanying \~20 minute podcast with one of the authors. It is also meant for physicians, but I thought a good chunk of it was clearly explained enough for a somewhat more general audience, especially since a lot of you out there are pretty good about educating yourselves on the disease.

I am currently part of a team of design thinking students. We are trying to develop meaningful solutions for people affected by IBD in a very broad sense. At this point, we have developed two prototypes on which we would love to hear your critical opinions so that we can try to improve or adjust our approaches. We'd be happy if you're interested and find the time to give us some feedback.

Imagine having to use a public toilet and finding this one. Please take a couple of minutes to look at the picture and listen to [this audio](https://clyp.it/ssuzo0fl) file at the same time, imagining that you really were in that situation.

What were your first thoughts hearing the audio? You can also add an emoji here. :)  
How do you think using a public toilet with a poster and sound like this would make you feel?  
Would it help you to relax?  
Would you prefer using a toilet like this or one without sound? Why?

&#x200B;

**Rent-A-Loo**

Our second prototype covers an app which is introduced by the images below.

If you would like to test it in more detail, e.g. in an online interview, we would appreciate hearing from you! Otherwise, feel free to just leave us feedback here, covering questions like:

What do you generally think about the idea of booking public toilets?  
Under what circumstances would you use this compared to using a normal public toilet?  
How would this help you in your daily life (if at all)?  
Would you be willing to pay for such a service?

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot for taking the time to share your thoughts on our ideas! Again, we would love hearing from you if you would be willing to give us more detailed feedback in an online interview. But commenting here also already helps us a lot.",2020-07-02 15:44:06

I found research that suggests that corticosteroids, which solumedrol basically is, are linked to decreased libido, but I also know that both men and women with IBD have an impaired sex drive due to the disease/complications. Has anyone experienced a decreased libido from entyvio? I talked with my gyno about it and my theory, and she thinks that the solumedrol is the most likely to be causing this.

So quick back story I had my oldest daughter 4 years ago, took a bunch of antibiotics presumed to contract c diff (I saw presumed bc they never could sample my stool) after recovering from that I had a new found gluten and dairy intolerance. During this time I also starting passing mucus with tinged bright red blood in it. Fast forward 6 months free of passing the mucus, I ate something with shrimp in it, it happened again. Slowly brought gluten and dairy back into my life and have been fine ever since for almost 2 years. About 6/7 months ago, I again are something with shrimp in it. This happened again. Rewind to two weeks ago, we ate at a Mexican restaurant where everyone at my table got shrimp and I got chicken I’ll just assume they cooked it together, and it happened again.. for the first day I had awful diarrhea directly after eating the food accompanying the excessive mucus with some tinged pink blood streaks in it. I’m still passing it even two weeks later. No diarrhea. But I was wondering, does this sound like food intolerance affect still lingering, or the early diagnosis of UC? I read so where that c diff itself does not cause IBD, not true that is. If that’s the case and I had it back then, 4 years ago, could I have been in remission that long?

1148,Mesalamine was ineffective,guppygirl103,4,hmhu6w,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/hmhu6w/mesalamine_was_ineffective/,15,"I was diagnosed with UC and prescribed 4 pills of Lialda daily.  After two weeks, if anything, I had only gotten worse, including an incident on Friday when I had severe abdominal pain and passed stools that looked to consist entirely of clots of dried black blood.  The office was closed Friday, so I called my gastro doctor today.  He was surprised to hear I had had those symptoms, as when he conducted the colonoscopy, there were no ulcers and he considered my case “mild-to-moderate”.  He’s taking me off the Lialda today and putting me on a “hefty” dose of Prednisone, with instructions to take it today, tomorrow, and Wednesday and call Thursday if I’m still not in remission.  He said the next option, since the Lialda didn’t work, is an immunosuppressant medicine, which neither of us is thrilled about.  

It also seems odd to me, as my blood work came back in a way that suggested it’s not autoimmune.  There are two types of antibodies often present in the blood with autoimmune disorders that weren’t present with mine - the doctor’s notes even said that it “almost ruled out autoimmune conditions”.  I’m a little concerned about how well an immunosuppressant would work, given those circumstances, but I suppose that’s something to discuss with him when I see him on the 16th.

EDIT: I also already had fucky liver enzymes BEFORE taking the mesalamine and it’s known to CAUSE fucky liver enzyme levels so that might have been a factor in him taking me off the mesalamine.  He also put me on 60mg Prednisone for 3 days, then 40 for 3, and then 20, so the initial high dosage might be why he expects to see rapid results.",2020-07-07 00:16:28

My UC diagnosis only came about two weeks ago.  My first flare began roughly at the same time that I began taking a drug called Midodrine for the POTS, so we suspect that's what caused it.

Being diagnosed with UC has rocked my world.  Ever since I was little, my daydreams for the future included having a child or two of my own, alongside one or two adopted children.  Even with the EDS and POTS diagnoses, that idea didn't change, because my own life was testament enough to me that it's possible to live a fulfilling, happy life with those things.  But UC is its own special kind of hell, and if I had a child, and that child inherited ulcerative colitis, I don't think I could ever forgive myself.  It's really hard to deal with the emotional fallout of the effect this is having on the future I'd envisioned for myself.

What makes it harder is my mother's reaction.  She's convinced that the Midodrine is what caused it, and if I stop taking the Midodrine, once this flare ends, I'll never have UC symptoms again.  She adamantly refuses to believe that this is a lifelong, incurable condition, and her insistence on denial is making it even harder for me to cope emotionally with this.

I can crosspost this if anyone knows of a more appropriate sub.

So, I have a follow up on Tuesday regarding the results of my biopsy but of course I’m impatient and would like to know if anyone else has received similar biopsy results as me.

Terminal ileum biopsy: Normal

Random colon biopsies: Focal active colitis with changes suggestive of melanosis coli. No evidence of microscopic colitis. Per the pathologist, the differential diagnosis includes infection, ischemia, allergy/medication effect, inflammatory bowel disease, and unexplained etiologies. 

If anyone received similar results: 

1) What were the next steps taken in order to determine which diagnosis it actually was? 

2) What was your eventual diagnosis and how was it treated? How long did it take to feel better?

A little bit about my self: I’m 25 years old, female, and at 7 years old I was diagnosed with delayed gastric emptying (Gastroparesis). Since then, I have always had issues with diarrhea and nausea but it was mild and infrequent. However, these past few months, all my symptoms have escalated so quickly. I am now experiencing weight loss, loss of appetite, intense nausea, vomiting, cramping, bloating, occasional abdominal pain, piercing headaches, bowel movements that are pretty much diarrhea 100% of the time as well as being especially painful and hard to pass, followed by bouts of constipation, and intense rectal bleeding.  I had an emergency colonoscopy done (the one I had set up with my GI Dr was nearly two months away and my symptoms began to worsen further). They found internal hemorrhoids and took biopsies. While I’m not sure this is related, I’ve also been experiencing low blood pressure, faintness, paleness, dizziness, constant fatigue, and malaise. 

I know I should just wait until my follow-up but I’m scared. I will admit I’m not familiar with any of the terms in the biopsy report. I’ve googled some but everything seems to contradict each other or doesn’t really fit what I’ve been going through. I’ll leave it to the doctors of course, but my symptoms seem to most closely align with IBD. I’m not very educated on this so of course I could be very wrong.

This stuff is starting to effect my work. I threw up in secret 3 times today and have had to make urgent rushes to the bathroom. Due to the dynamics of my very active job, this is definitely not ideal and I’m not always near a bathroom. I had to get back on Prozac just to handle the stress it’s been giving me. It’s helped a little bit.

If you haven’t had a similar experience, I would still appreciate some support. This has been one of the worst times of my life. This is getting harder and harder on a daily basis and I dread knowing that this possibly isn’t a quick fix. 

Thank you all for reading. I needed to vent a little as well so I appreciate you all for letting me use this as an outlet.

I’ve never posted here and I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask, someone recommended I ask here.

I have had a history of bowel issues my entire life, been diagnosed with IBS / IBD, just had an endoscopy/colonoscopy done and I had 3 10-12mm polyps removed from my sigmoid colon. I’m feeling alright albeit a little nervous when the doctor says “precancerous” and my anesthesia hasn’t even worn off yet... 

My question is this: I’m assuming bleeding is normal after having a biopsy done, and I am going to call my GI tomorrow to ask, but I’m having black tarry stools that are pretty painful. Is this common for anyone that’s recently had a biopsy? I was expecting some blood but this is kinda worrying me. I feel fine otherwise, no fever or fatigue etc...

I'm a 22 y/o female with celiac disease and asthma but otherwise pretty healthy, despite having a great deal of uncomfortable symptoms (TMI ahead).
I been having stomach problems for yearsss, but when testing was first done it was only discovered that I had (mostly) silent celiac disease, and that perhaps my issues with other foods and weeks of cramping that would disappear for a month at a time before reappearing was a result of the damage in my small intestines and it would go away as I stayed gluten free. 
I was gluten free for many years but continued to have issues. Last year I went through an eating disorder and started eating gluten again, but I have been gluten free again for over 7 months. 
About 4 months ago I got a sudden and severe uptick in my symptoms. 
I had a week of several pain and cramping around my right mid/side and back that seemed to be in the same area as my appendix, possibly a bit higher. I was having a week of constipation where I would only be able to get out mucus, and then suddenly I was having loose stools that would shoot out of me once a day after my coffee. 
The pain disappeared and I was relatively back to normal except for that I would have random spells of nausea. I never really threw up, but I would feel really ill all of a sudden, and usually after a few minutes it would go away. 
I started to get cramping, a lot of indigestion and nausea about 30-90 minutes after eating that would intensify for a few hours and then go away. This would last a week at a time and then things would be fine for a couple weeks before that would return. 
At the same time, I started to get more and more mucus, often with little bits of blood in my stools. 
The stools were sometimes fine other than the mucus, other time they would be extremely urgent but not particularly loose, and for a few days at a time they would be very loose, urgent, and happening 3-4 times in the morning and not again until the next day. 
During the very loose days, I would end up with anal fissures because of what felt like acid. 
Now for the last few weeks, they have been more solid but it appears as though a great deal of food is undigested. 
There is mucus, sometimes with blood in it, and a good deal of the fruits and vegetables I have eaten at dinner appear the next morning, almost entirely intact. I know that fibrous foods can appear in stool, but I'm getting peas that look as though they've only just been chewed a bit, large quantities of grapefruit pulps that look entirely intact, and now even what appears to be whole rounded pieces of rice from rice cakes. 
Sorry this is so gross. 
I've also been having that severe pain in my stomach and radiating into my back and downward around 30-90 minutes after eating. I feel nauseous and become full very quickly and the food comes back up into my throat for several hours after. It's awful. 
I had bloods done and I know that my CBC was totally normal. 
Still waiting to hear about the bloodwork that would indicate inflammation. 
What do ya'll think...? 

Sorry again for tmi and thank you for reading and responding x",2020-07-18 09:37:44

1192,"Anyone have pericarditis during an initial acute severe flare? Just diagnosed, but also having heart issues.",smashley2142,5,hu4epv,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/hu4epv/anyone_have_pericarditis_during_an_initial_acute/,2,"Hello! My husband was diagnosed with severe UC on Tuesday. We’re at Day 14 in the hospital (due to a misdiagnosis and multiple days of antibiotics that he didn’t need). Sigmoid scope a few days ago and some gnarly photos of a very angry colon. Biopsy showed early IBD. Ulcers everywhere. 

Biopsy also confirmed that this was an acute episode. He had a clean colonoscopy in Feb. This started in the last week or two. 

Yesterday was the fourth day of IV steroids without much improvement. We were 30 mins away from a Remicade infusion when he started having stabbing pain in his back (left shoulder blade), radiating through to the front. 

EKG showed signs of a massive heart attack and everyone came running (absolutely terrifying). They ruled out heart attack and most of the other scary stuff via echo/scans/heart monitor. 

Presumptive diagnosis on the heart issue is pericarditis or myopericarditis. I haven’t been able to find any case studies with similar characteristics at acute presentation of UC (only ones discussing it as a side effect of the anti-TNF drug class or ppl who had IBD-type issues that ultimately didn’t have IBD). 

He’s also a steroid “failure” so he needs the Remicade. Nobody wants to give him the remicade yet bc we can’t find a case study and they’re worried about the side effects of Remicade on the heart issues. Cardio is prepared to clear him for it after a cardiac MRI, but the other teams aren’t necessarily on board with that plan. 

It’s kind of a catch 22. 

My question: Anyone else have this issue during initial presentation? Anyone start Remicade after? Anyone have secondary inflammation that was attributed to UC? Any chance they’re missing a bigger diagnosis of some systemic inflammatory condition?

Anecdotal evidence is basically what we’re looking for right now, so if you’ve got a similar story, please let me know! Thank you!!",2020-07-19 19:37:05

It has helped me so much since I was diagnosed, so thank you to everyone for exhibiting the trust and vulnerability it takes to talk about your experience. Long post/vent warning, but I hope someone has some advice on how to cope with this because I doubt I'm the only one on here to experience something like this. 

I was diagnosed with LC last year after years of being told it was just IBS. As many of you will understand, it has major impacts on my quality of life and really controls my every move. Jobs, vacations, and everything else was/is dictated by the fear of a bad day away from home. 

My family knows about my long-lasting digestive issues, but I'm kind of the ""suffer in silence"" type and don't really like to talk about the problem unless someone expresses a genuine interest or concern. I just don't like to be that person to complain and lecture people if they just don't seem to care, plus, it's a pretty embarrassing subject! So, that has left me pretty much talking to only my husband about the problem, who is so supportive and really understands how challenging and emotionally exhausting it is to deal with this disease every day. But the rest of my family doesn't express any concern whatsoever, even when I try to explain as best I can, so I just let it go when they clearly aren't listening. 

When I was diagnosed, I told my family and explained how I was still struggling to find an effective treatment. All of the standard treatments were unsuccessful, and my GI just told me to take 4 Imodium every day with no end in sight. Obviously, this is not a sustainable treatment because missing even a single dose brings my symptoms rushing back, so now I live in the fear of missing a dose and what that would mean for the next day. Plus, it's still not perfectly managed on that treatment, so I've been pretty disgruntled and felt a little hopeless the last several years. 

I was preparing to find a new GI doc because I was really unsatisfied with my original doctor, but then the world had other plans and I found out I was pregnant. It was definitely a surprise, but a happy one. Managing LC while dealing with all of the pregnancy symptoms has been really challenging, but I'm doing my best with the support of my husband. However, I'm not comfortable experimenting with other treatments while pregnant, so I'm stuck managing it as best I can until I can find another doc and try other treatment options. 

Well, a few days ago the lack of support turned to an even worse situation. My sister and niece called me and immediately said ""So you know how you have no control of your bowels?! Well we were talking about how you are going to poop all over the table when you're in labor"" and then just had a good laugh about it together. I wanted to hang up, but instead I just tried to brush it off and said something to the effect of ""Thanks for making fun of someone how has a diagnosed medical problem - you guys are jerks"". I guess they thought I was playing along, because they just kept laughing about it and having a good time even though I couldn't even crack a smile. After I hung up, I was trying to process it, but the pregnancy hormones took over and I had a pretty big breakdown. I mean, they just used one of my biggest fears about having a baby as a  way to make fun of me. I've been feeling so hurt, embarrassed, sad and frankly mad the last few days. I texted my sister after and told her that I understood it was just a joke to her, but it's something I really struggle with and it really upset me. I said I'm having a hard enough time dealing with it every day without being made the target of people's jokes and I would appreciate it if she didn't make fun of me for that in the future because it really hurt. Her response was ""it was a joke"" - no apology, no acknowledgement that it was a misstep on her part, nothing. That part almost hurt more than the actual joke because I can understand why she might think it would give me a laugh, but when I took the time to tell her it was not something I could laugh about, she made me feel like I was being stupid for being offended and hurt. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time I've been made fun of by my family, but this was the one that hurt the worst and I'm having a really hard time processing and moving past these emotions. 

TLDR - Does anyone else have experience not having great family support to the point of being made fun of because of their digestive issues?",2020-07-19 18:14:31

Isn't fecal lactoferrin more than simply a ""positive/negative"" test? My result simply came back ""positive (abnormal)"".

52 white male here, history of joint inflammation in the past, perhaps 25 yrs ago. Was on methotrexate for about 2 years in my 20s, then Celebrex for about 5 years, then nothing was needed through my mid 30s until now.

I've not had a normal bowel movement in about 4 months. I didn't think it was possible to have diarrhea for more than a month and not die. 

For around 4 months I've had persistent nausea, cramping, fatigue, Olympic grade diarrhea, no diet selection seems to give remedy. I haven't had a drink in 3 months (I thought alcohol was a factor). Also, no weight loss.

I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy last week. GI said it was structurally normal, but some evidence of acid reflux in esophagus. He did a few pathology tests and the results were posted yesterday. I'm seeing him tomorrow for a follow up. 

It may be just a quirk of the lab's online reporting system, but there is no scalar value given to the lactoferrin, just ""positive/negative"". Dr. Google shows most tests have values in ug/mL(g).

Should I be expecting something beyond positive/negative?

The pain can appear in a matter of minutes out of the blue and can last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks.  
For the last two months I've had very severe pain somewhere in my hands. It started in my thumb then that settled and my wrist flared then my ring finger then my index finger and back around again.  
I've gone to my gp and he prescribed naprosyn ec but i haven't taken them yet.  He also contacted my ibd dr to arrange an appointment but with the whole covid backlog it could take a while to be seen. 

Do any of you suffer with the same thing? 

I really just want to know I'd there's anything i can do to alleviate the pain when it flares and is there anything i can do to prevent it happening.  I'm really struggling to find information.

I’ve been dealing with some form of GI issue (I assume) since March. Well, before that kind of. I had, what I first thought was food poisoning, on New Year’s Eve. That ended up lasting a good week or so, so I thought it may be Gastro. That passed and things seemed normal other than a near constant discomfort in my chest (worrisome in itself through COVID). In March, it seemed to get worse. Had heartburn often, lots of belching and bloating, at times pain in my upper abdomen and losing weight (possibly due to change in diet). To make matters worse, COVID was in full swing so I couldn’t get to see my family doctor. Had a phone appointment with her and she thought maybe Gastritis. Started some PPI. Did one round of that and it seemed to get a little better. Stopped the PPI and things were semi normal but then started to flare up again. I am still waiting on a scope to see if anything can be seen. I’ve had a couple rounds of bloodwork and the only thing that showed up was my hemoglobin being slightly low. All in all, I’ve lost about 40lbs since March, with the caveat that I was the biggest I ever was and am no longer eating any fast food or snacking in the evenings. Lately I’ve been getting more spotty pain at different points in my abdomen. The belching and bloating is pretty much stopped. But now I seem to get a little light headed when I go from sitting to standing. 

I’m just really stressed about not knowing what’s going on with me and I don’t know what to do in the meantime.

EDIT: in an unexpected turn of events. I received a call today and they had a cancellation, I am scheduled for my scope Wednesday morning! I was originally told end of August at the earliest.

EDIT: scope complete. The doctor said she seen nothing concerning, just a little redness and inflammation so likely just gastritis. Apparently gastritis can linger for quite some time. She did take a biopsy to test for H. Pylori. Thanks everyone for the replies.",2020-07-27 01:21:07

It's flu season, and it's been going around, but I've also been struggling with trying new medicines and their side effects.

I switched from Remicade to Stelara (had my starting infusion 3 weeks ago) and tried to supplement that with (started and stopped before the Stelara) Azathiopran, 6MP (lasted about a week) and now Trexall (started on the 1st).

Everything seems to have ""Flu like symptoms"" on the list of side effects (under the contact your doctor right away section).  I contacted the GI office that prescribed the Trexall (most recent and most probably cause, if it's a side effect) this morning, but haven't heard back yet.

I actually felt like I caught something when I got home from the Pharmacy Tuesday picking up the Trexall, but didn't start having real symptoms until Friday/Saturday.

The oddest/most concerning part about it is that it seems to be keyed heavily on my bowel movements.  It can be normal for me to have sinus/allergy problems when I've got a bowel movement waiting that has stuff I'm a little intolerant of, but I've never had symptoms like this or had it effect the Flu like this.

I steadily creep up to about a 4 or 5 in discomfort, with a stuffed up head, end up having a bowel movement (generally normal movement for me), and the discomfort drops to about a 1 or 2, and my head clears up right away.

If I don't hear back by morning I'll contact my primary GI's office (they put me on the Stelara) and let them know as well.  (I do have a blood test due to see how I'm doing on the Trexall, and I'm probably taking that tomorrow morning as well)",2020-01-06 23:26:59

I’ve lost a lot of hair. It’s starting to look like I’m going bald near my hairline, which saddens me a lot because 1) I can’t hide it, 2) I used to have really thick hair, and 3) if I’m balding at 21, I’m very afraid to know what’s going to happen in the next couple of years. 

I’ve looked into taking oral Biotin supplements, but found out I can’t because it has gluten in it (which I can’t eat). So, do any of you guys struggle with hair loss, and have you done anything that’s made it better?

It's been flailing and causing me pain but I've managed until now to keep it relatively controlled. I'm being started on a biologic in the next week or two.

However I took a sleeping pill last night. Dr prescribed zopiclone. My problem is that I sleep eat when i take these. I did last night and i truly don't remember what i ate.

I woke up in the most horrendous paid I've ever felt. I thought maybe i had a blockage in my small bowel and treated myself for that, to be sure. 

The pain I've experienced is a pain I have never ever felt before. I've had serious blockages in my bowels. Both in my small and large colon.

The pain I'm feeling is like I've swallowed a knife and it is shredding my insides. Its moving. It started on the left and slowly over the day it moved to the right. The exact same pain. I'm concerned that in my night eating that I might have swallowed something I shouldn't have. I do the eating in my sleep and have very little recollection.

I'm currently running a low grate favour of around 38.6 or there abouts.

Even though I was eating exactly the same foods at home as I was these past couple of days in college, my symptoms have gotten MUCH worse. And since my college is close to my house, I don’t think the differing environments would have that much of an impact. So, I basically think my unconscious stress over school is what is causing my symptoms to worsen, because this always happens to me. Whenever I go back to school, it seems my symptoms get worse. So what do you guys do to handle unconscious stress?? Because I’m not actively stressed out; I’m doing things that make me happy, like playing piano and walking and hanging out with my friends, but I guess my body is still stressed out?

I had been dealing with some stress with work, as well as anxiety, and I knew it was only a matter of time before it happened.  Also, I had to take some prescription antibiotics for a sinus infection and that just made it completely worse.  I reached out to my doctor because I wanted to try and get this handled fast.  Originally I wanted Prednisone, but he recommended that I try the enemas first as they are a bit less harsh since they don't go directly into my bloodstream.  I was fine with this as I have never used them before, and I would rather try the least harsh treatment first.  


To make a long story short, I have been using them for about 3 days now, before bed.  I use the enema as described, wait for about 30 minutes laying on my side, and then go directly to bed after.  I have noticed some improvement already, but I was expecting a faster improvement.  


So my question is for anyone who has used these or are familiar with them, when will I be seeing more of an improvement?  I know it has only been three days but I am anxious to having some sort of normalcy again.  


Also to add, I have been dealing with UC for 15 years and I average a flare every couple years.",2020-01-17 01:40:30

I've dealt with stomach issues my whole life,  but within the last 6 years it has taken control of my life, sick with chronic constipation issues, swollen intestines, a hiatal hernia and GERD.

Ive had at least 7 Colonoscopies in the last 6 years, I will be 30 in April of 2020, not sure if that has any bearing on anything but yeah.

In july of 2019 I had a colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy and and a endoscopy done in one go.  They said they found inflammation of the small intestine and affected the left side I believe the sigmoid colon? finding small ulcerations throughout it.  They said well clearly you have some small ulcers and some decent inflammation, we don't know what it is persay, so we'll treat it as IBD since the inflammation is there.  So they put me on 3 months worth of steroids I was ok for a bit then they took me off of them in the end if October of 2019.  Ever since they discontinued the steroid I relapsed and flareups are non-stop. Now they tell me use enemas, take Miralax, lots of water, stay on the FODMAP diet and exercise. I can do all but one of those-- Exercise. I can barely leave the house because 85% of the time I'm sick as a dog, and when I'm not in flareup mode, I'm resting because being sick all the time as I'm sure you all can relate to, takes a lot out of you both physically and emotionally. So I do everything else, still not seeing results. Within the last year I've lost 25 lbs due to not being able to eat. Colon polyps and colon cancer both run in my family, so of course that will ALWAYS be looming in the back of my mind. I'm in so much pain, I'm at the end of my rope.  I wish they'd treat me for the symptoms I have, like put me on something for UC or Chron's (both run in my family) if neither work, back to the drawing board.  They aren't treating me, I wish they'd do SOMETHING to treat these symptoms. My last GI doctor's visit was in November.

I don't know how much more of this I can endure.  Are there any suggestions you all might have for me as to what I can do moving forward?  My next Dr's appointment is on Feburary 4th.  I feel like I've hit a wall, all I really want are some answers.

I started getting suspicious that there’s something wrong with my body because with the amount I eat surely I should be gaining weight...

I started experiencing bad acid reflux. Had an endoscopy that came back clear. I have diarrhoea on and off and have done ever since I can’t remember.

However, last month I started getting cramps, constant rumbling noises from my rectum/stomach area and noticed blood in my poo for weeks (not everyday though and not too much blood). I also noticed mucus in my poo. Eventually went to my doctor and asked for a stool test. 

Stool test came back today and I guess the levels were high because my doctor is sending me for a colonoscopy.

I have a history of severe anxiety. The pain in my stomach isn’t that bad, like I barely feel it throughout the day but there is the odd day when I’ve eaten a lot my stomach cramps and my stool is loose.

I've been Dx tentatively with IBS but went for a colonoscopy to rule out IBD as a have a family Hx (cousin & uncle, fairly distant). Anyways, I've been a pescatarian for over a decade, no dairy, no gluten, the odd glass of wine and have been working so so hard on my gut health & pain with a naturopath while awaiting this procedure.

So afterwards, my GI stated they found several ulcers in the lower small bowel (ileum) which “could be normal or Crohn's” (waiting on biopsy results).

For now...out of curiosity, does anyone know how normal ulcers would be in the ileum? Wondering what the likelihood is of crohns for a young person like me. What can someone do to help them heal?

I have been having digestive issues for almost 2 years now and it is progressively getting worse every flare up. I have seen GI specialists and have been to the hospital a couple times but am still looking for answers. My primary care is concerned that it is a more serious matter and wants me to see a better specialist but it is taking a lot of time for the referral to go through. I am hoping if any of you can tell me whether my symptoms may be similar to what you are experiencing. This flare up has been really bad and is becoming debilitating as my school semester has just began again.

I’m a 23 year old female. About two years I was having severe abdominal pain (I remember it being upper abdominal pain but not sure) and was hospitalized. They said it was Gastritis and gave me smooth muscle relaxers for cramping. Since then, I have had severe stomach pain almost every morning with very loose stools. I saw a GI and had a colonoscopy and have had CT scans. They said that the colonoscopy showed some inflammation and they thought it was IBS. This was about a year ago. The problem went a way for a while so I thought it was IBS and moved on. I recently had an endoscopy and the report said The biopsy showed chronic inflammation in the stomach and the top of the small intestine. They also said there was some water in my stomach even though I hadn’t drank or ate in 15 hours. That’s when they gave me a prescription of pantoprozole and never told me what was going on. Since then the pain has been progressing and I’ve had severe nausea and bouts of vomiting. I have had blood in my stools that I initially thought was a hemorrhoid or fissure since there was pain (like a tearing) during vowel movements. Now there has been significant amount of blood where the whole toilet is red and has been for about two weeks. I have severe upper abdominal pain and have had diarrhea that lasts about 3 to 4 hours usually in the morning. The first major day of the flare up I was vomiting for 24 hours and have had trouble keeping food in. The past few months I have had trouble drinking even water since it comes back in my mouth. Now I have been unable to eat without pain. I feel like I have really bad acid reflux but I have been on pantoprozole for a month and it did nothing. My primary care thinks that my stomach problems are more significant than just IBS and that they need to be addressed quickly and recommended the capsule test to look at my small intestine but I have to wait as it’s taking a long time to schedule an appointment with the new GI specialist. The first day when I was vomiting, I had a fever so she thought I had the stomach flu on top of the stomach problems I already have. I think she may be right but i am concerned because I have seen another doctor and been to the emergency room in the past 2 and half months and every time they have said it’s the stomach flu on three different occurrences. Is it likely that you can get the stomach flu three different times in such a short amount of time?


I have trouble expressing my concern to doctors as it seems like they disregard what I’m saying. I’m a 23 year old woman in a doctoral program and look much younger so I feel like they think I’m overreacting and that my problems are due to school stress. Because of this, I have trouble telling them how much this is affecting me. I don’t know how to get anyone to take me more seriously.  I can’t tell them that now I am becoming concerned about how I am going to attend lecture and clinic when I’m in so much pain and constantly needing to be in the bathroom. My primary care does take me seriously and she keeps telling me I have symptoms of chrohn’s or ulcerative colitis but my original GI kept only making comments on how young I am and how these issues do not happen to young women. I am not sure on where to go from here. It’s the weekend now so I don’t know when I’ll even be able to get in touch with the GI. When I do, I am not sure how to be taken seriously as an adult. I used to avoid going to the doctor because I would hope it would eventually pass. Now it seems like every flare up is 100x worse than the last.",2020-01-25 18:58:10

1309,My IBD and Health Concept Survey,VNagendra,3,etzfth,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/etzfth/my_ibd_and_health_concept_survey/,6,"Hi everyone! my name is Varun Nagendra and I am a 21 year old senior enrolled at Youngstown State University. I am pursuing a biology major and degree in medicine. In March of 2018, I was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. At the time, I was in the spring semester of my junior year in college. What was thought to be only a minor health issue turned out to be nothing but. From these experiences, I couldn't help but come up with a solution for one of the dilemmas I had - I will explain that in a bit. To test my idea, I developed a brief 15 minute survey and see whether it is feasible or not.

I know surveys can be super annoying, especially when it is about something that may not even concern you. For that reason, I thought I would provide you with a brief backstory to not just explain the following survey, but to hopefully connect with you on a more personal level. If by the end of this intro you think these matters simply do not click with you or lack the appeal, you are more than welcome to go on with the rest of your beautiful day - I still thank you for hearing me out thus far :)

If you do choose to take this brief survey, I want to thank you for participating. Your feedback is sincerely appreciated. I understand how busy you probably are, so I am grateful you chose to dedicate some of your precious time to answering these questions. I have posted the link at the bottom of this post :)

Note: The survey contains the same backstory that I have provided below, so no need to read both!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of today, there is no permanent cure to ulcerative colitis. Instead, there are only a variety of treatments to make the disease tolerable for patients, with the end goal being remission - a stage in which the disease and clinical symptoms subside. 

Secondly, the disease is very inconsistent in nature. The same disease can manifest in anyone, anywhere, at anytime, for any reason - and it can go away just as mysteriously. Furthermore, the SAME condition may present DIFFERENT clinical symptoms across multiple patients. For instance, between two individuals with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, one may experience bloody stools and incontinence while another may only feel abdominal pain and cramping - of course, every symptom varies by degree and no symptom is mutually exclusive.

So what options do such patients have? Well the most tried and true method out there is a colectomy, during which a part of, or the whole colon is removed. Typically, this is performed as a last resort and in extreme cases, where no other treatment options have proven to be effective. Unfortunately, I seem to fall into this category - more on this in a bit.

So what options are out there? Well...pretty much anything if you have an open mind. Standard procedure usually entails treatment via a class of medications known as biologics (Humira, Entyvio, Simponi, and Stellara are some examples). Supplemental or temporary methods of relief may include steroids, 5-ASAs, Acetaminophen, exercise regiments (or lack thereof), yoga, meditation, mindfulness, acupuncture, homeopathy, and much more. But probably the most significant supplemental treatment method is **diet and nutrition.**

Just like all other treatments, the diet best for one patient may not be best for another. However, researchers have been able to roughly identify some of the types of foods that tend to cause further issues for most colitis patients. Some examples include the typical list of unhealthy ingredients like sugar, fats, and cholesterol. But many of the foods that I discovered are problematic for me are not on such a list - these include spices, vegetables with high fiber, lactose products and even fruits due to their acidic nature. But as with all things in life, there are exceptions, perhaps even more so in this scenario. One patient may be able to tolerate fibers perfectly fine while another would end up in the restroom within minutes.

However, one thing all these patients face? A dietary restriction in one way, shape, or form. More often than not, it is enough to not just be an inconvenience, but a complete nightmare, capable of changing lifestyles. This could be socially, mentally, athletically, educationally, or even religiously.

At this time in my life, one of the more severely impacted areas from my disease was my education. Now, its no mystery that diet is not exactly the most maintained part of a typical college student's life, let alone a student with excessive dietary requirements. I can personally attest to the fact that all those rumors you hear?...well...let's just say they can be true ;) We HAVE eaten cereal for dinner, we HAVE skipped breakfast if we are late to class, we HAVE skipped meals if we aren't hungry, and we HAVE eaten Ramen noodles or fast food five nights in a row. Now, obviously this is nowhere near healthy for a regular student, but for an ulcerative colitis patient? It simply isn't sustainable. 

After my diagnosis, each day that passed, my disease worsened. What originally started with occasional bloody stools, turned into always bloody stools, which turned into, 2-3 more bowel movements, which eventually became 8+ movements of nothing but blood, incontinence, and the inability to digest food or absorb nutrients. After a year had passed, I was beginning to lose weight and energy. My attendance rate plummeted to nearly 50%, which in turn increased stress, which would worsen my condition further. Nonetheless, I continued to self-study and force myself to keep up with my classes anyway (bad idea). By then, I was so fatigued, I didn't have the energy to buy or get food, let alone make it. I scoured online for any solution, and all I found were directions, rules, tips, and recipes - none of which mattered if I didn't have the energy to follow them.

Fast forward another 6 months and I began developing severe abdominal pain, to the point that I was admitted to the emergency room on three separate occasions. I was cumulatively in the hospital for about 20 days, which was more than enough for me to fall behind the point of no return. Catching up would be impossible and so I had no choice but to pursue an emergency gap year.

By November 2019, I was under my parents' care at home - which is where I am writing this from today. To date, my condition has limited improvement, mainly due to - you guessed it - diet. I no longer have to make my own food or stress about what to eat or force myself to consume something that is as good as poison. Thanks to my mother, we have established a rough food log, and she is able to adjust her cooking to AT LEAST sustain my condition. For this, I am grateful because I know many do not have such a support system.

Now, am I on the road to recovery? Not even close. Currently, we still have not found a feasible treatment that works for me. I am on my third biologic, and nowhere near remission. Unfortunately, the daunting thought of surgery seems to be more and more likely to become a reality. But I have more time. I may not be getting better but I am no longer getting worse. I am stable. I am not in agonizing pain. I can function. I can write this, what was supposed to be a brief, introduction - sorry! 

With all this said and done, I couldn't help but wonder that maybe had I been on my mom's diet earlier, my disease wouldn't have gotten so bad. Maybe if I had the access to a diet suitable for my condition in college, it would have given my medications a better shot of working.

With all this said and done, I couldn't help but wonder that maybe had I been on my mom's diet earlier, my disease wouldn't have gotten so bad. Maybe if I had the access to a diet suitable for my condition in college, it would have given my medications a better shot of working.

But the past is the past right? Wrong. Well...maybe for me it is. After all, I am back home under as-perfect-as-can-be conditions. But what about for everyone else? Not just people with ulcerative colitis, but everyone who has been diagnosed with a medical condition that limits their dietary freedom. Everyone who simply needs one less thing to worry about. And then I remembered. There are plenty of meal services online right? The first one that came to mind was Blue Apron. You can go online, choose a meal plan for you, and have fresh ingredients delivered right to your front door - especially with the recent development of so many delivery services (Grubhub, DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc).

After more digging, I could see some of the restricted dietary options available...but only for the most popular restrictions (some may even argue they are lifestyle choices). These include lactose free, gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, and so forth. But what about vegetarians who can't eat fiber? Or lactose intolerant individuals who can still eat cheese? These two examples both highlight the dietary inconsistencies brought about by so many medical conditions. Inconsistencies that I was never able to find to be accounted for in modern day meal services. Furthermore, many such companies ship you ingredients, meaning you still have to make the meal yourself - which does no good to a patient who is stressed, fatigued, and/or busy.

Which brings me to this survey. The survey is designed as a market researching questionnaire that allows me to analyze the thoughts, opinions, concerns, and demands that patients like me have. But maybe I could be wrong. Maybe I am just a one-of-a-kind case and no one else feels the same way. Maybe there is a meal service out there that has already addressed this issue. Maybe there are some logistics that are simply just not feasible. At the same time, maybe there are others like me. Not just college students but anyone - a mother who is fatigued from a condition and still has to take care of her kids or a husband who has no lunch options at work. Maybe this is something we could all use. Most importantly, maybe this idea is something that can be the difference between a quick medical recovery and ending up in the OR. This survey is designed to test all these concerns. 

Oh and one last thing, I promise :)

At the end of the survey is a brief contact form to provide me with your name, email, and phone number. Providing this info is completely voluntary and will not be seen by anyone but me. The reason for this info is simply for me to provide you with, if you choose, statistical information about survey results. Additionally, **if** by some chance the demand is high enough and this project takes off, I can provide you with updates, information, and perhaps SOME day, even discounts/rewards for helping me begin this journey :)

Once again, I would like to thank you so much for taking the time to read this far. Also, whether you choose to complete this survey or not, I wish you the best of luck with your health and future endeavors. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at [vnagendraphotography@gmail.com](mailto:vnagendraphotography@gmail.com).

DISCLAIMER: Please do not interpret this post or the survey to be clinical, professional, or medical advise in any way, shape, or form. The information in this post is purely anecdotal and highlights my experiences as well as what did and did not work for ME. As mentioned, these can vary greatly from person to person and each patient needs to determine what is best for themselves. Furthermore, the survey is not intended to be used for any research or advertising. Rather, it is purely a method by which I can personally determine whether my idea is something worth investing my time, money, and effort, into.

Sincerest regards, 

Varun Nagendra

Hi everyone first time posting on Reddit pardon me my English isn’t very good it isn’t my native language so let’s get to the point a month ago or something I started noticing mucus in my stool but I wasn’t much so I didn’t give it much  thought that time I was a heavy smoker and suffered from post nasal drip and being as stupid as I am I thought the mucus in my stool was because of it as the quantity of the mucus varied daily an it wasn’t that much after all until 5 days ago suddenly I got very nauseous and tired at first I thought It was just cold but 2 days later I started pooping way way too much mucus the scene was horrific I rushed to the doctor who first thought It was a sort of bacterial infection and asked for a stool analysis prescribed a couple of pills then asked me to check next week next day the mucus quantity in my stool dropped significantly and diarrhea started and I got pretty bad it was no way that I was gonna wait for another week went for another doc this time I got the stool analysis back and guess what it didn’t show and kind of bacteria but cal protein was 271 the new dock said he was sending me to a gi and said he will probably scoop you and prescribed some pills said they would help till I met the gi but I don’t know there was something about the second doc that was off to me so I went to a new one mom used to go to he examined me and said that I had an inflammation in some part of the colon told me to stop the meds the two previous two docs prescribed and gave new ones one of them is Pentasa(which I found out online that it’s used for mild cases of uc not sure if it used for any kind of colon inflammation) told me to use them for one week then do a couple of tests then get back to him he if the tests are good there is no need for CT’s can or a colonoscopy and I am already  feeling pretty good the diarrhea is almost gone no mucus and no nausea I fell normal only 2 days after taking the meds just as he said he is suspecting some sort of allergy or that I ate something bad with a lot of spies that caused the inflammation When asked about possible ibd he said I was getting ahead of things asked me if i was losing weight and that’s another point for the past 2 weeks or so I stared felling more and more hungry but I only eat my target calories per day and I didn’t lose any weight so I don’t know about that the thing is I am really terrified about being diagnosed with an ibd as I have a friend who was diagnosed with uc maybe 7-8 years ago and he have just got a really bad flare up for about 6 months now and been submitted to the hospital twice and I have been visiting him and have seen what he looked like and it’s not pretty not pretty at all oh forget to mention all this time there was no pain it was just the felling of excessive gas that I couldn’t get out and now it’s significantly improved sorry for this long story it’s just I don’t know what to do or what to think looking forward to your advices thanks a lot for reading",2020-01-29 11:31:11

I’ve done well to stabilize symptoms over the past month or so since my last flare up but lately, with no obvious dietary or lifestyle change, I’ve started to get an almost burning sensation in my stomach and sharp yet, subtle pains in the lower right quadrant. What makes this so much different than most symptoms I tend to have is the feeling of an empty stomach. I’ll have a medium sized meal, say, Eggs and toast and within 15-20 minutes I start to feel like I’m starving. But it’s not actually hunger, just the stomach sensation of being hungry. I feel like I could continue to eat all night if I wanted, meal after meal, but even if I try to eat more, the same feeling lingers and other symptoms start to come out to play. 

Anyone have a similar experience? Any suggestions?

For the past few years I've been on our cheapest plan, but I am currently in the middle of an IBD diagnosis (fecal calprotectin at 1400, endoscopy/colonoscopy next week to confirm).

The timing of me finding out the diagnosis is likely going to fall within a week or two of my employers open enrollment period.  This means that I will have to choose insurance for next year without really knowing what this disease is going to cost me.  I have generally been healthy until this started so I've always gone with the lowest plan. I'm 30 years old and just started having issues this year - they are unpleasant but I am functional, the worst being diarrhea and back pain, so I'm not sure where I lay on the spectrum of mild-severe (again if a diagnosis is confirmed).

I suspect that the plans offered for next year will be similar to this year with minor price increases.  The planthat I have now has a high deductible ($5000 for me & my spouse combined), 20% coinsurance on visist and does not start covering medication until the $5000 deductible is met.  This plan is $90 biweekly for my spouse and myself. My employer contributes $700 a year to my HSA spread out over each pay period, and I contribute some as well.

The top level plan switches to an embedded deductible (which I dont fully understand) of 500 per individual. The cost for myself + spouse was $348 biweekly.  Office visits drop to 10% coinsurance and medication is covered in tiers with copays of $10/30/60/90 for 30 day supplies and a bit if a discount for 90 day supplies.

There is also a mid level plan that is very similar to the lower plan with a slightly lower deductible.

My spouse is a student and may be re-entering the workforce next year but for now needs coverage through my plan.

If anyone has any insights it'd be greatly appreciated.  Do you take medication 365 days a year? Or just until remission? I've read most people start with steroids and cheaper drugs, are they still expensive? Should I expect a follow up colonoscopy or other procedures, GI visits, etc?

Generally I manage with a careful diet - well cooked veggies, no legumes, gluten-free/lactose free.  When I flare I go on rectal mesalamine until it's under control.

I have been experiencing increasing fatigue and weakness - I'm a competitive long distance runner but I've had to cut back my training substantially.  Also an increase in muscle twitches, reoccurring nerve irritation/injury issues, and some trouble navigating broken up sidewalks that could be in my head.   And a constant low level nausea.

Went to the doctor to get bloodwork done.  The bloodwork results are surprising.

1) very low folate.  1.7 where 5.4 is the lower cut-off for ""normal""

2) high B12 - 1492 (don't know the reference range)

3) iron is normal, CBC is completely normal - absolutely no indication of anemia, infection, etc.

4) liver values all normal.

I'm just really surprised that my folate is so low while the B12 so high.    Especially since a) I have all the nerve issues and b) B12 is water-soluble.  My understanding is that folate deficiency by itself can result in fatigue, but nerve issues are associated with low B12, not low folate.

So my question to the group - has anyone else experienced low folate, normal to high B12, and nerve issues? (things like nerve pain in extremities).  

\[it is worth noting that I see where my normal diet might be low in folate, since gluten-free foods aren't usually fortified and cooking veggies well can destroy the folate.   Room for improvement there.\]",2020-09-02 18:54:42

My partner and I both are having the same symptoms and got sick at around the same time. So I'm not 100% convinced I have IBD just yet. I have seen over 15 specialists and don't have an answer yet. It's been almost a year so I'm finally breaking down and at least trying to get the inflammation under control until I find the cause.

I'm new to all of this, not even properly diagnosed yet, but this is my worst fear. 

I went through hair loss years ago and it made me suicidal.

Right now I have been diagnosed by 2 different specialists with crohn's, ulcerative proctitis, GERD, gastritis, or indeterminate inflammatory bowel disease. 

My main symptoms are from my anus / rectum. My inflammation was found in my esophagus, ge junction, stomache, a patch in my cecum and a patch in my rectum.

I know some people will preach to me that getting better is more important than hair, but to me I would rather just end my life than deal with all of this and lose my hair as well.

So far I am prescribed 1000 mg mesalamine suppositories and I was also prescribed a mesalamine enema in May by 2 different drs.

I read the side effects and when I saw hair loss and looked through the subreddits here, on /IBD and /ulcerativecolitis I found so many posts confirming mesalamine causes hair loss.

What meds caused hair loss for you? What didn't?

Been going on about 7-8 weeks of strange GI symptoms. Been through a ton of traditional workup testing including a colonoscopy endoscopy this past Friday. They found some aphthae in my terminal ileum. I've been mostly low fodmap for the past 2-3 weeks and was able to swing my symptoms of frequent undigested loose yellowish stools back to a side of normalcy was wondering what anybody's thoughts may be. Tests have all been normal with no finding for celiac or h pylori or other general fecal tests. I have difficulty sleeping, staying asleep, tons of burping, some gas and bloating, brain fog, anxiety, fatigue, occasional night sweats, nueropothy pains and some slight muscle twitches, candida thrush on tongue.  I'm thinking potentially hydrogen dominant Sibo or chrons. Starting to loose faith here.

Yesterday I had tons of energy and mowed the lawn did chores around the house visited with a friend but today I'm paying the price. Headache fatigue, general malaise. 

This all started with stomach pain and diarrhea but now the mental symptoms have had a slight uptick. Extreme belching has persisted throughout.

I'm a 26 yo female who has had IBD for about a year and a half now. In August of 2019, my colonoscopy was ""aborted"" because my colon was so inflamed the GI doc was afraid the scope would cause permanent scarring. They decided to immediately start me on Remicade without getting an official diagnosis (UC suspected). Around March of 2020, my blood work showed antibodies against Remicade as intermediate. Because I didn't experience any symptoms, my doctor decided not to change course of medication. Come July 2020, Remicade basically stopped working entirely and I've been experiencing a flare for two months now (went to the hospital, got another colonoscopy, waiting on biopsy results, in an uncomfortable amount of pain and can't really leave my house). I'm pretty bummed because infliximab is like the gold standard treatment atm for both UC and Crohn's.

I think if it had taken longer, I would've fallen more on the moderate-to-severe end of the spectrum.)  I had BMs hourly, they were purely liquid and occasionally consisted entirely of undigested fat, I couldn't sleep more than two hours at a time due to the pain, etc.

After a failed week-long trial of Lialda (the doctor told me he had put me on the highest amount he could safely prescribe, and the fact that I was actively getting worse after a week was a sign it wasn't going to work no matter how long I stayed on it), I was given prednisone to induce remission (which worked, like, the very next day.  Honestly, I was kind of shocked.) and a prescription for azathioprine (my insurance shot that down so I'm on mercaptopurine instead.  Doesn't matter much overall, except that if I ever want to have kids I'll have to switch to azathioprine, since it's pregnancy-safe and mercaptopurine isn't.) and Humira

I've also had a calprotectin stool test that was normal, and have had some blood tests for inflammation markers which have been ok.

So all of the above has really not to lead to any answers. I can go months and months with normal bowel movements, but then experience a couple months of misery (which I'm in the middle of as we speak).

The stools are anywhere from a 4 to a 7 on the scale, ranging from thin stools to watery nothingness. There is usually also watery blood when wiping but never seems to be in the stools.

Rarely I will have thinner stools but also lots of normal thick stools. Sometimes I burp up food and sometimes my stomach will rumble excessively. Sometimes when using the bathroom my butthole will burn. Also sometimes I notice abdominal tenderness all over my abdomen that is mild but noticeable when touched. I also notice I don't digest some foods very well and will see the food in the toilet.

Has anybody in here experienced anything similar? About three weeks ago I started experiencing some difficult times to pass stool but it doesnt look or feel hard as in constipation. I go only in the morning and it feels ok but incomplete, then ill go again and strain to get some little pieces out. Sometimed they look flat. Also it ranges from brown to yellowish sometimes. Today I went in the morning but only a small amount came out and it had like this white clods of mucus, is this normal with IBD or something like that?  Also it feels like im going not very often since I was used to go twice a day and now just once. I wonder if I maybe have some kind of blockage but i dont feel bloated or in pain. I strained and strained today and i only could get white mucus out. Sorry, I know it sounds disgusting. I passed blood once. 

My question is, has anybody experienced something like this? Im so scared it might be colon cancer. But i also believe that just before this all started, i could pass big bowel movements without any trouble, and If i had a tumor big enough to block me, I would be in pain, right?

Please, im not looking for a diagnosis but a little advice and any similar symptoms.

I had an upper endoscopy because i had a weird feeling (still have) in my throat. It showed esophagitis and gastritis. And normal blood tests btw. However, no colonoscopy, FOBT negative.

1454,New here. Looking for advice,emeraldsaiyan_92,10,ivy6fy,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/ivy6fy/new_here_looking_for_advice/,7,"Hi all, I’m new to this subreddit and don’t post very often on reddit so apologies for any errors in this post! 

I’m looking for advice or just some support as I’m feeling very alone in what I’m going through right now. 
I have had a lot of illnesses throughout my life and currently suffer with polycystic ovaries, asthma, back and joint problems and my mental health - all which have been debilitating at certain points in my life. 
One of the things I have suffered with in the past is bowel movements and one doctor when I was very young suggested IBS but also attributed it to my anxiety which seemed to fit. For when I was stressed, my bowel seemed to suffer the most in terms of going to the toilet a lot, gut pain, constipation, diarrhoea etc. 
I’ve just sort of got on with it but things have taken a drastic turn in recent weeks. 

A bit of a background: 

For a few months now I have suffered with chronic constipation and bloating. I found that making my diet more plant based and cutting out gluten has helped with this, along with taking a stool softener as prescribed by my GP. I still eat fish and eggs and get my heathy fats in too. I eat fairly healthy and have a normal BMI. My job is exhausting as I work for the health service but I try and destress by practicing yoga and getting a good sleep and read where possible.
However as soon as I stop taking the stool softener as advised by the GP when things become loose, a couple of days pass and I clog back up again. 
Occasionally I’ll find blood in my stool and mucus. My rectal examinations by GP have said they can’t feel a thing. 


A few weeks ago I was taking broad spectrum antibiotics for a skin infection - unrelated - and of course my bowels were all over the place. 
I was going to the loo above 10 time a day. Pale stools. Blood. Mucus. Violent diarrhoea. It was like torture and I could feel a prolapse when actually going to the toilet. 
I thought this was a bit extreme for antibiotic sensitivity and went to an out of ours GP who thought this might be antibiotic induced C Diff. Couldn’t feel a prolapse but I had managed to take a picture (crude I know but I had to for my own peace of mind) and he agreed that it did look like a prolapse but assured me that it would go back to normal when I wasn’t going to the toilet so much. Told me signs and symptoms to look for if it got any worse but was happy I was managing to keep down fluids even though I had lost over half a stone in just under two weeks.
 I had an appointment over the phone the next day with my normal doctor who took a history, got bloods done and upon stool samples confirmed C diff. 
I had to have time off work for this, managed to go back in for 1 day when I probably wasn’t well enough to do so but was 48 hours clear of diarrhoea so felt like I had to... 

I thought that was that even though I was still feeling rotten and unable to eat normally. 
Doctor called me last week and said that another test had come back from the stool sample. Calprotectin is it? Said that had come back sky high and he was thinking IBD. 
At this point I had begun to get bad symptoms again, blood, mucus, pain, extreme fatigue and feeling sick constantly. Still losing weight. I felt so poorly at work I had to beg my manager to go home. 
Manager was EXTREMELY unsympathetic. Basically asked me ‘what was wrong now?’ Even though she new why I was off the week before. Surely a health professional wouldnt want a person spreading the highly contagious C Diff round a ward right?! 
She then went on to tell me that I ‘looked well for someone who keeps going to the toilet’ and that family members of hers ‘were on deaths door before they were diagnosed with IBD’ even though my colleagues had remarked throughout the morning how poorly, thin and pale I looked. Manager asked if I wanted to stay for another hour. I said no because I felt as though I was going to crap myself and I had been to the toilet 3 times in the space of an hour! 

So apart from work being unsympathetic, the doctor has referred me urgently to gastroenterology which is great. But an urgent referral is an 8 week wait in the current climate, what with covid and a severely strained and underfunded NHS here in the UK. 

I have gotten a bit better stomach wise in that I am able to keep a little bland food down. But now I have lost close to 10lb. Im so tired all the time, and every time I eat my stomach feels like it’s attacking itself. I go from constipated to diarrhoea in the space of one bowel movement to another. Prolapse seems to have rectified I think... but I’m not going to the toilet over ten times a day, closer to 6 or 7. Mucus still present, blood not AS present. 
I call the doctors again the other day and he’s given me an antispasmodic and painkillers but it’s not helping as much as I’d hoped. 
I’m still off work until the beginning of next week as signed off by the GP. But I’m just not sure whether to go back or not yet. 
I’ve triggered sickness policies at work because of coming back for a day and going off again, so it’s 2 sickness episodes in the last 6 months 🙄 even though I’ve had no sickness since having a knee op at the beginning of the year - I was back in feb.

I am even more concerned as my mother had colorectal cancer when she was in her early 40s. And my grandmother also had bowel cancer. I am 28F. 

The really sad thing is that my husband and I have begun trying for a baby last month and this has thrown everything for a loop. 

I’ve not been diagnosed with IBD by a gastroenterologist yet. But I seriously need some advice or if any of you know of anything to help with this interim period before diagnosis and/or treatment? Anything I can do to help my case or anyone who has been in a similar predicament? I would really appreciate the advice. 

Thank you 

TLDR: on urgent waiting list for 8 weeks to see gastro. Not diagnosed yet but GP thinks highly likely. Looking for advice and support during the interim.",2020-09-19 20:40:13

I was diagnosed in late August with UC, placed on 40 mg prednisone. Just a week ago we tapered it down to 30 mg. I’m also on Balsalazide 750mg 3x a day. 

I have HSV-1, but not on my mouth. Generally, a maximum of maybe once or twice a year I will get one little ouchie that will go away quickly with just home treatment. Hadn’t had one in at least a year or two at this point!  Until just last week, I got the most aggressive outbreak I’ve ever had. I had a bike accident a day or two before it started and I thought maybe I’d busted my crotch on the bike or something. But, no. It’s hanging in there a week later and hurts like heck. And I have been taking fairly high doses of L-Lysine to try to help it along. So I’m going to call my doctor Monday but in the meantime I’m wondering if anyone knows if there’s likely a relationship between the prednisone, or the tapering down of the prednisone, and a herpes outbreak?  Or the Balsalazide? 

The timing just seems weird I guess since I both had a bad fall/ hurt myself and had tapered the prednisone down just a couple days before this problem started. 

Also wondering if anyone takes these drugs I’m on and Valacyclovir, or knows about the potential interactions.",2020-09-20 01:49:03

I’ve been on salofalk (mesalazine) for three years, using tablets and suppositories regularly and never had any problems.

I recently moved and have a new doctor- he prescribed me Pentasa suppositories rather than salofalk. I know that the active ingredient in both is mesalazine so there shouldn’t be any problem there. However, I’ve had a slightly awkward problem! I can’t seem to get these new suppositories to insert properly, so to speak. With the salofalk ones they’re a conical shape and made of wax and they seem to insert very easily. The pentasa ones are a lot harder and tablet shaped and just seem to stay in the same place until I have to remove them from discomfort. Has anyone else had this issue? Any tips or is there any reason why I might not be using these properly? 

Thanks!",2020-09-28 19:05:40

I finally got sent to Gastro. He thinks I have i forget what kind of colitis (the appointment was 2 hours long and I was given a shit ton of information).

I’ve had digestive issues for years that I assumed were IBS. I started having more frequent symptoms last year. Then I was really sick in December, and since then have not been back to normal. All my symptoms could be IBS but I have several strange things:
-weight loss, I went from 105 lbs to 88 lbs and still losing weight. I’m petite so a few pounds makes a big difference. I eat pretty light due to lack of appetite but still get 3 meals a day. 

-Pain every day in the same spot in my left pelvic area, below the navel.

-I have cramping and gas at night and my “poop alarm clock” wakes me up at 5 or 6 AM every morning. 

-I had a stool test and it was positive for E. coli. I took antibiotics and then had a negative test, but I kept having symptoms. It seems strange I had E. coli present for so long. Is it possible I have some other condition that predisposed me to an infection?

-During the infection, I had a blood test and my liver enzymes (ALT and AST) were extremely high. The doctor thought I had hepatitis. All the tests came back negative. I had an ultrasound and then a CT scan and everything was clear. The levels came down gradually. Dr still doesn’t know what caused it.

-I stopped taking birth control as a result of the liver test and haven’t gotten my period since, 4 months now. 

My main symptoms besides the pain are gas, bloating and early satiety, and loose stools. I don’t have frequency of diarrhea, usually just 1-2 urgent loose, mushy stools in the morning. I sometimes have a tenesmus feeling later. I have loud gurgling a lot of the time from my bowels. I’ve modified my diet to cut out almost all insoluble fiber but still have diarrhea every day. None of the IBS meds work for me, like bentyl. I took Xifaxan for SIBO and that did nothing. The doctor wants me to try nortriptyline next.

I never saw blood or mucus and my calprotectin and crp levels were low. My CT didn’t show any signs of Crohns. Blood tests were normal other than the liver function. Because of all that the doctor thinks UC is impossible and Crohns extremely unlikely. 

Autoimmune diseases run in my family (dads side all has Hashimoto’s) and I have a cousin with UC.

I can’t get a colonoscopy right now because they’re only doing emergency appointments. Hopefully I can do one soon. Just wondering how much I should push back against the doctors belief that it can’t be IBD.",2020-06-02 14:19:17

I’m struggling since 4 years with burning pain after bowel movement.

If I don’t have bowel movements I’ve zero pain. The pain is proportional to the feces size. Bigger they are, worse is the pain. 

I usually have bowel movements in the morning and the burning pain last all day. The next morning I wake up without pain till the next bowel movement. 

During this year the diagnosis was always CPPS or Pelvic Pain, because in the early days I had also pain in my penis. 

I did a lot of exams:

- uroflometry
- 4 spermiocultures
- transrectal prostatic ultrasound
- 3 urine cultures
- spine radiography
- spine magnetic resonance
- 2 pelvic magnetic resonances
- colonoscopy

Doctors consulted:

- dozens of urologists
- 4 proctologist
- 4 neurologists
- gastroenterologist
- 3 pelvic therapists


Like many people here, everything came out clean regarding infections or other big issues. Prostate is ok except some calcifications.

Colonscopy showed a small diverticulosis and a small sigmoiditis.

My wondering is if during these years I was concentrated too much on the prostate while instead the problem is bowel or something like proctitis.

What do you think? What other exams do you suggest to do?

I had diarrhea for almost 6 months straight, about 6/7 times a day and sometimes i would feel so weak i unintentionally drop my phone or whatever im holding. I ran to different clinics for a diagnosis and they just said some bullshit until we suggested for a bloodtest. and then, IBD..
I was admitted into the hospital for a body checkup through endoscopy and colonoscopy
They took many many bloodtests, had 3 times of plugging in the IV and few iv drips during the stay. From 3 days stay to 6 days, we were confused. After i was discharged, i was prescribed with mesalazine and a milk formula that will be my food for the next 5 months. No chocolate no nothing, just milk and water and the meds.
And every month i had to go back for a blood test, sometimes with a stool test too.
So i heard alot people saying that IBD cant be 100% cured.
 Now at 17, where i have been going back every year for a bloodtest. All my tests came out as normal. As if ive never gotten IBD. They wouldnt discharge me because they thought it was weird, why would this girl recover 100%? So yep.. thats my story.. i just had my Nth blood test.. hope everything will turn out fine like always!! Stay safe and strong everyone!! You can pull through this!

My gastro put me on budesonide, but it was not effective. It made me nauseous and didn't relieve my symptoms (was still having painful cramps and watery diarrhea 10-12 times a day). I tried telling my gastro that the medication wasn't working, but he just gave me a lecture about being consistent (I think he thought I wasn't taking the pills). My mom wanted to keep me on the meds, so I stayed on them for 2 years. 

When I turned 18 and went to college, I stopped taking the budesonide, and haven't been to a gastro since. I manage my symptoms by keeping a pretty rigid schedule and diet. I still experience the painful cramping, and (TMI) haven't had a solid BM in 12 or so years, but for the most part it's livable. It sucks that I can't really live a regular life, and have to think about when and where I can access a bathroom at all times of the day.

My question is--is it worth it to go back to a gastro? Reading the experiences of other colitis-sufferers in this sub, it kind of seems like most gastros will either try to put me back on budesonide or just tell me to manage the symptoms with immodium and pepto.",2020-06-10 04:23:21

It’s extremely painful to the point that I can’t move that joint at all because of the pain. I’ve had UC for 7 years but in the last 6-7 months I’ve been taking meds for it. I was on mesalamine, but it wasn’t working so my doctor put me on azathioprine. Currently on 200 mg daily and I think my dose needs to be increases because I’m not in remission yet. My question is, do any of you have arthritis due to UC and if so did it get better when you hit remission? And what treatment have you done for the arthritis that had been helpful? TIE

Edit: I should also add I’m a female, 29...
Thanks for all the recommendations. I will talk to my GI doc tomorrow and see if he can refer me to a rheumatologist. Have y’all had any success with OTC meds to help with the pain? I just picked up some Aspercreme to see if it would help, but my pain only got worse over time. Any of you use essential oils on your arthritis. I hate taking new meds, just for them to give me other side effects.",2020-06-14 23:41:00

After gastroscopy and colonoscopy about 6-8 months ago my gastroenterologist now wants me to start mesalazine and also have an mri but after ive started the mesalazine as opposed to before which i thought would make more sense so as to see wether the mesalazine works? Anyway my brother has been diagnosed with crohns for around 4-5 years and is on his 8th different medication and every med he has been on has given him terrible side effects, fatigue, joint pain, weakness, headaches, low white blood cell count etc and he has yet to have any remission from his symptoms! So my question is, should i even bother? My GE has basically tried to say” well if you dont treat it now youll get bowel cancer later” thing is right now i have learnt to deal with my symptoms ( primarily stomach pain, urgency to poo, large number of poos/day nausea) and still hold down an active job in construction.

I barely noticed it back when I was in the worst of the flare because it was just THERE all the time; but it had been gone and now I'm aware of the fact that it's back. My question is: I'm not sure if it's because my symptoms just haven't responded to the mesalamine yet, and the lower dose of prednisone isn't controlling things as well as the higher dose; or if the mesalamine itself could be causing the pain?

Hi all,

I posted about this survey around a month ago and got quite a few responses from Reddit so just wanted to raise some more awareness! **King's College London** are currently recruiting for participants **aged 18+ with a diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)** to take part in an **online survey** exploring why some people may internalise stigma related to their IBD. This online study involves completing some questionnaires about yourself, how you manage difficult thoughts and feelings and how you feel about your IBD.

This will take around **25 minutes in total** and you can enter a prize draw to win one of ten £15 Amazon UK eGift vouchers (or your country's equivalent - e.g. $15 Amazon voucher).

It would be *amazing* to hear from as many people as possible! We would like to hear from anyone who meets the criteria in bold above, regardless of whether you experience any stigma related to your IBD or not.

The survey can be completed on any computer or smartphone at the following link:

Turns out it’s...proctitis? I searched it up and I don’t even have many of the symptoms? And it seems like something else must be causing it, yet the diagnosis only said proctitis (and also took 4 biopsies)

Sent me home with a letter with a follow appointment in 6 weeks....so, am I supposed to just keep bleeding out of my ass and fainting from the blood loss for the next 6 weeks then? I thought they’d prescribe me medication or something. 

I’m not sure if I agree with the diagnosis, is it possible to get it wrong?

ALSO during the procedure I have no clue what the nurses or surgeon said because I was sedated so all I know is what was on the piece of paper I was given.

I asked the question ""isn't it because I've been on medication for four years?"" he replied that there should still be signs even so. I was undiagnosed, taken off Mezevant and left to wonder wtf happened for those 18 months if it wasn't colitis. 

A year later and I'm starting to think maybe he was right I've been off medication for a year and I feel fine. Then. I notice blood. Maybe I have a hemorrhoid *nervous laughter*. 

The bleeding continued for a week before all the other symptoms joined for the ride for over a month. Today I had my colonoscopy and was rediagnosed as having Ulcerative Colitis. I'm starting Mezevant again and hoping to achieve the same results as I had previously.

 - I took an antibiotic and saw no improvement, so it’s probably not anything bacterial
 - My liver enzyme levels are elevated in a way that suggests my gallbladder is fucked.
 - My gallbladder looks fine on ultrasound.
 - My liver looks fine on a CT scan.  We don’t know what it’s doing.  We do know that the lymph nodes are swollen around my intestines.
 - I saw a GI doctor, and he thinks it’s likely either autoimmune hepatitis (family history), ulcerative colitis, or Crohn’s.  He asked me to provide a stool sample and I have the kit, but despite the fact that otherwise I cannot STOP shitting, if I try to use the hat thing to collect a sample I suddenly cannot FORCE myself to go.
 - My blood sed rate is stupidly high.
 - I have a colonoscopy next Monday.
The concept of having a colonoscopy is already intimidating.  The idea of trying to pay for it when I cannot work due to a severe chronic pain disorder is downright frightening.  The prep - 4 laxative pills and an 8 oz laxative drink on top of having existing severe diarrhea - is TERRIFYING.

Back story: I was diagnosed with eosinophilic gastroenteritis 18 years ago. I haven't been actually treated for the last 8 years because I didn't have insurance.

I'm very stressed right now because I think I've given myself food poisoning, when my inflammation is already up. 

About a week ago, I started trying to eat foods that I know are beneficial for IBD, I already eat plant foods, which improved my symptoms, but I wanted to see what was specifically good for me. I heard papaya was good so I bought some and had half of it one day. The next day I started getting frequent extreme cramps out of nowhere (which has never been a symptom of my IBD). These lasted for roughly 3 days and the cramps were so debilitating. I could barely move and I had to sit in a certain position for long amounts of time to try and avoid them, they weren't the usual cramps I get before going to the toilet. One notable thing, is that once or twice when I did go to the toilet, I noticed my stool had very a bunch of weird with small, slightly clear, circular things inside. Really sorry for that image.

After 3 days I cried tears of joy to find out that they had mostly stopped, partly because I had no idea what was causing this and was scared it was a new symptom that I had to get treated for. Today (about 2 days later) I had the other half of the papaya, not thinking anything of it and not wanting it to go to waste. Now about an hour later I feel the cramps coming again but slightly less painful.

I searched online for papaya and food poisoning, and I found out last year there were a few articles about how papayas were giving people salmonella, specifically Mexican papayas, mine did not specify the country of origin. I am so anxious that tomorrow I'm going to wake up with the extreme cramps again from that papaya. I don't feel nauseous yet otherwise I would've thrown it up immediately. 

I know this may seem like typical IBD symptoms, but from my own IBD it really doesn't feel like it, I may be wrong though.

Does this sound like salmonella poisoning?

Had blood taken and a CT SCAN was performed & I was diagnosed with colitis & given a script for Metronidazole & Levaquin (I refused Cipro). I was told my sigmoid colon is inflamed. But my question is- is colitis the same as UC?? I was told to schedule an appt to see a GI specialist in 2 days, which I will do.

(I tend to be constipated and have been taking Sunfiber, a hydrolyzed guar gum to stay regular. It is low FODMAP.) 
I tend to eat low carb but last week I had coffee only for breakfast, consecutive days of eating spaghetti squash, which may have irritated by gut, in addition to changes at work that sent my gut motility a kilter...then Friday we were at a party where I had too much alcohol and 3 chocolate chip cookies--- all these things, in hindsight led me to a trip to the ER.

As an aside in 11/2018 I was in the ER for colitis & given Metronidazole & Cipro- but pain and constipation was the issue then..no other issues until now.

I know only the GI specialist can truly diagnose me, but what do you make of what's going on with my gut? Does this sound like I have IBS or just a freak thing I will be affected by periodically?

English isn't my native language, so I am sorry if there are any typo's and stuff :)

Last january I have been diagnosed with Crohns Disease after 3 years of stomach and bowel pain, nautiousness and tiredness. I also lost 10 kg because of this. I was a little overweight and after the weight loss I had a perfectly normal weight. My BMI was very good (22,3) and I felt better in my body, even though I still had the stomach pain. 

At this moment I ate a lot during quarantaine and because of my medication I feel so much better, which led to eating more than before. Right now I weigh around 70 or 71 kilos and my length is 1.67m. My BMI is still okay, but these extra kilos are not good for my mental state. I am not saying I am fat, and every body is beautiful, but I do want to work on my own body. The problem is, doing full work outs just make my stomach and bowels hurt SO much. I feel worse after a work out instead of better. I do some yoga instead, but that is not as effective as working out.

I want to lose some weight (2-5 kilos, not more!) in a healthy way. Maybe you guys have some tips for diets which are safe to try with Crohns, without a dietist? If this is not possible, I understand. I am quite new to this disease and I do not want to trigger it, now that is is going so well with the medication. I hope you understand!

Thanks in advance!",2020-06-23 22:40:15

Everywhere I read, it's defined as watery, loose stool. Type 6 or 7, as I understand.

However, how would you define frequent (from 3 to 7 times a day) bowel movement of formed stool? Type 4 to 5 and sometimes even a small one like type 1.

1596,My first colonoscopy experience,colonoscopyhrowaway,30,hfgiym,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/hfgiym/my_first_colonoscopy_experience/,15," 

Hi all, I am in my late 20s and due to some bleeding and constipation had to have my 1st colonoscopy. I just wanted to briefly discuss my experience:

I was very nervous going in as I have bad health anxiety to begin with. I was terrified that despite the very low odds I was going to be perforated (I was obsessed with it). So for the prep I had to take 3 ducolax and something called Bipeglyte (I am in Canada, not sure if it's common elsewhere). The prep wasn't that bad. Zero pain and you just run to the bathroom a lot for 2 hours to essentially pee out of your butt. I had a split dose so it was running to the bathroom a for a couple hours the night before and a couple hours the day of. Some tips-Buy Vaseline and some flushable wipes as toilet paper will kill you by the end of it. As I was so nervous I had no appetite so not eating was not a problem for me but I imagine that's usually the worst part of it for most people, especially if your appointment is in the afternoon. Stock up on jello, yellow gatorade, and ginger ale and you will be ok.

As for the procedure itself, well there isn't much to tell you! When I got to the clinic they gave me a gown that opened in the back, they do give you an IV (I know some people are terrified of needles but I promise you it i quick and will not hurt). They will you into the room and you say hi to the doctor and anesthesiologist. In the USA, versed and fentanyl is common but here in Canada they give you something called propofol (what Micheal Jackson OD'd on) and let me tell you I see why he loved the stuff! Despite sleeping less than 1 hour due to my fear of perforation, despite being under for only 40 minutes, I felt like I had just been out for 10 hours! I know some people are scared of being put under but I promise you it will be ok. The experience was far less hassle than going to the dentist, and I encourage everyone who is 50/has symptoms to go. My findings were benign. I worried myself to death thinking of perforation/pain and everything about the procedure was fine

TL;DR-Getting a colonoscopy is not tough and I promise you will get through the prep and procedure without much hassle, it is far better than letting a cancer go undiagnosed. If I can do it so can you!",2020-06-25 07:22:51

After years of slowly gaining weight, I’m finally where I consider healthy, but I’m actively trying to build more muscles. I track everything I eat, which started because I wanted to make sure I was getting enough nutrients, but I’m honestly still confused. I follow a few fitness related subs, and the nutrition calculations never really work for me. I have my Crohn’s relatively under control, but often experience constipation and fatigue. On these days my calorie count is usually under where it needs to be, but on days after I’ve had intense workouts I ear so much.

I'm trying to do a low FODMAP diet to get my bowel issues back under some measure of control (I do have medication as well, it's helping some), but it seems like most low FODMAP foods require cooking, and POTS causes such severe fatigue that it's extremely hard to do anything, and I usually require at least one nap of 2-3 hours to get through a day because of it.  Also due to POTS, I need a high salt intake, yet most low FODMAP food doesn't seem very salt-heavy.  Does anyone have easy foods for bad fatigue days?  I'm primarily thinking things like something I could keep in the freezer and then just pop into the microwave or the oven for meals, or bagged snacks, since that's where I used to get most of my salt (seriously, there's so much salt in those things).
