0,Brown rice is a trigger but white rice isn't?,ulcerativebolitis,2,ex9ugj,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ex9ugj/brown_rice_is_a_trigger_but_white_rice_isnt/,8,"I had never had brown rice before, and recently I've been trying to find optimal foods for my digestion, I found foods with lots of fibre helped me have regulated, normal bowel movements as my main symptom is usually constipation.

So I tried brown rice knowing it has more fibre than white rice and I really liked the taste however it gave me quite sudden (severe) diarrhoea just 10-20 mins after eating it which is extremely unusual for me and white rice doesn't do this. My colon is not inflamed as I'm on prednisone and it works well on me so what could this mean?

I want to have it again to see if it was just a one off but am scared because it left my body in shock I guess because it emptied me out and I had less regular bowel movements for a few days after. The diarrhoea was just after the meal though it didn't continue on after.

My questions: Could it have been something I ate before that? Is it possible to be intolerant to brown rice but not white rice? Is rice intolerance even a thing? Should I try it again (in a controlled environment of course)?

I'm almost certain its not the fibre in the brown rice because I regularly eat fibrous foods and do not have any bad reaction and even if I did it doesn't make sense for brown rice to give me such extreme diarrhoea (it was straight up liquid and made the same noise as a garden hose hitting the pavement, if you know you know).

I appreciate any advice. Also if anyone has any vegan diet tips for ulcerative colitis I would greatly appreciate as I'm trying to learn as much as I can.",2020-02-01 18:52:08

2,Starting Remicade soon,WowItsCharles,4,ex5d85,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ex5d85/starting_remicade_soon/,12,"Hi everyone. Just looking for advice or thoughts. Ive posted here a couple times before and the replies helped me before.

Ive had UC for a little over a year now. Has been constant 10 bowel movements a day give or take, only a couple good days I can count on one hand. Its draining and the only thing that seemed to help slightly was a medium dose of prednisone, which I obviously can't stay on.

&#x200B;

I've tried Mesalamine, Delzicol, Humira, and Entyvio with no signs of improvement in the first 3 months each. Next up I'm starting Remicade and while I want to be hopeful THIS will be what works, I just can't believe it since that's what I thought when I started Humira, and when I started Entyvio.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to get some feedback on other's experiences of these treatments and maybe get some hope for Remicade. Thanks!",2020-02-01 13:19:41

Anyone else had inflammation skipping?,,6,ex2rle,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ex2rle/doctor_cant_make_a_definitive_diagnosis_anyone/,3,"Quick backstory: out of nowhere I started having HEAVY bloody diarrhea up to 10+ times a day for weeks. GI prescribes me Prednisone and a few weeks later the bleeding and diarrhea stops. Everything was fine except my large intestine during my colonoscopy and endoscopy. 


During my colonoscopy my Doctor noted that certain parts of my colon were not inflamed. He said that was common with Crohns so he took a bunch of samples for biopsies and then scheduled a barium MRI.

The barium MRI showed a pristine small intestine and the biopsies came back negative for granulomas. But he also said skip lesions (I think that wss it) were incredibly uncommon in UC. 


So now I'm left here feeling very unsure about what exactly I have.

Has anyone else experienced something similar to this?",2020-02-01 08:45:33

At the worst I'm in and out of the bathroom all day, even when I have no stool left I'm still having to run to the bathroom just to excrete blood and mucus.

I started on mesalamine and prednisone for a while, moved onto uceris, then humira, and finally ended up on Entyvio with Apriso pills.  The only think that really had any lasting improvement was the humira and the current Entyvio with Apriso.  Humira and Entyvio alone took down my symptoms but i still had some inflammation and ulcers.  A couple of years ago my doctor was talking about starting to consider surgery if Entyvio didn't work out.  I'm so happy that I stuck it out and that things are going well!

&#x200B;

Here's a summary of what I've done along the way to help minimize the symptoms and overall in my opinion aid in my recovery:

* Don't eat any animal products (more of an ethics thing, but I think it helps)
* Stopped drinking alcohol and coffee
* Almost completely avoid spicy food, caffeine, beans (aside from soybeans for some reason), and tomatoes/other nightshades
* Get enough sleep regularly
* Figure out some safe foods that I really enjoy and eat them often
* Use probiotics and drink kombucha after I eat something that I'm nervous about (likely placebo, but your mind does impact your gut)
* Cut down on stress in general
* Exercise regularly.  I think this one has been a big one for me to stay strong physically and mentally.  UC can really beat you down mentally so its good to see some long term progress in your body in other way.  Personally my exercise is rock climbing.  I think it works pretty well with UC since you can do it at a gym where a bathroom is always near, the intensity is high when you're climbing but you do rest a lot too so overall i think its not as hard on you.  Those of us with UC also tend to be on the skinnier side which also helps, and its a very long term progress sport, so even if you have seasons of shit and flares you can still progress in the long term

&#x200B;

These are just my thoughts and reflections, I wish you all luck on your personal UC journey.  One word of caution I have would be to never forget how much UC can mess you up mentally.  I've been borderline in remission now for a couple of years but still tend to reflexively turn down fun and just in general allow my life to get too regimented.  I still have quite a long ways to go to get past the PTSD of the various flares I've had, so please just take care of yourself and keep trying to enjoy your life.  Worst case scenario you shit yourself.  And lets be honest we've all done it and it wasn't the worst thing in the world.",2020-02-04 20:02:21

I’ve been getting very mild flare symptoms recently. I started Humira a few months back with high hopes this would send me into remission after a few months long flare following being taken off 6mp. I had been on 6mp for the last twelve years. A new GI I started seeing wanted me off because I’m in the highest risk bracket (male, 29). It was frustrating enough to come off a drug that had worked so well for me due to a slight risk but I understood and agreed. I had difficulty accepting now with this most recent flare off 6mp that oral meds weren’t going to manage my condition. I was on Lialda only and it didn’t do anything to control the flare My doctor explained I have an aggressive case of UC; I never thought of it this way because I had been in remission for basically 12 years. She wanted me to start Entyvio infusions once I started flaring about 6 months off of the 6mp and again, I had difficulty accepting that my disease was this aggressive warranting infusions. That’s quite a drastic change in the treatment I had been used to. She optioned alternatively for me to try one of the new oral meds or Humira. I opted for Humira bc ironically it was cheaper on my insurance. Now that I’m getting minor symptoms back, she’s said multiple times that “if I FAIL Humira, we’d be looking at Entyvio”. I just found this super off putting. For an autoimmune disease, I’m sure we all experience feelings about our bodies rejecting us. Is it so much to ask for doctors to consider their verbiage when discussing things like this with patients? Like it’s not my fault the friggin Humira isn’t working as planned lady. I’m a therapist for a living so maybe this is just my therapist brain. But it just felt punitive to me. And maybe again that’s more reflective of my difficulty accepting infusions as a treatment option. I’ll be seeing a new GI this month because I moved. And I’ll discuss other treatment options with them to see if there’s any in between from Humira to Entyvio. Anyone have experience with Stelara in contrast to Humira? Are there differences?",2020-02-04 03:29:58

I couldn't take the suffering and my Guardian Angels  prompted me to go. So I went to local ER. 101.8 fever at check in, HIGH  BO and HR, low respiratory rate. They hydrated, me (4 IV's later and 18  tubes of blood9 from each arm + a failed IV and then another IV. Dr.  Pyle did CT scan and blood work and told me I had to stay.   
 My  anxiety hit the roof, I did not understand how sick I were at ER and  they had my pain in a good place, manageable and I had topped puking and  they gave me liquids due to severe dehydration. Due to pain contract  they can not send me home with pain meds. They told me to portal my PCP  when I got home explaining all this and tell them they by law are the  only ones who can manage the pain portion of this infectious disease. My  PCP treated me months ago if I asked questions of wanted explanation of  abnormal labs, I was not entitled to use use portal like the rest of  her patients, because I use the whole 1,000 letters allowed and she has  20 other patients and I overwhelm her. She had the practice manager in  on that meeting months ago. I told her if she and everyone else had been  worried about my labs over the past years I would not have progressed  to a SERIOUS liver disease, doing perm. damage to my liver. The practice  manager just nodded in agreeance with me. PCP said if I used the portal  again, she would get ""behavioral health"" involved. (WTF does that even  mean?!) I had sent her Rx requests and she blew a top and was very  condescending in that 11/4/19 meeting.   
 So after leaving ER tonight I  went home and did what the Dr. and Gastro told me. I portalled her  explaining, and telling her I need her to manage my pain meds, nausea  meds, and discuss the realty if I should go back and be admitted.

 I left a bunch out but NEED & REQUEST your thoughts on this. Do you  think my PCP is obligated to deal with the pain management? If she  refuses do I talk to practice manager and explain what I did to you and  whatnot?

After New Years I was feeling slightly better with more formed stools (no blood )but my doctors put me on entyvio and it worked nearly immediately! I have no blood and I only have 1-3 BM’s a day with no urgency. The stools are formed like snakes. I know I’m not suppose to drink but I had 6 Guinness’s last week and felt fine the next day. My poop was blackish that morning which is common with drinking Guinness and went back to normal that night. Soo to get to the point My doctor told me not to drink until I get this completely under control. I’m going in for a scope after I get back. Hemoglobin-11.3 and c reactive protein is 1.3.

I had to cut out dairy which was sad but I can deal. However, this past month and a week now, my UC has given me both an external hemorrhoid and proctitis. I have been at level 10 pain almost the entire time. I was in a point in my life where things were very emotionally stressful and I was getting ready to move on top of that. So it left me very little time to tend to these side effects. But the pain when I would have a bowel movement was excruciating. To the point where I was biting towels and pounding on the counter until the pain ebbed back down.  I ended up going to a prompt care because literally the pain was keeping me from walking. I couldn't work. Nothing because the pain was so overwhelming. I got there thinking it was the hemorrhoid causing the pain until they did an exam and told me it was the proctitis. All they were able to give me was a cream, which didnt help that much. In order to keep this from getting very long, Ive been to two prompt cares and the ER. The ER gave me suppositories which helped with the pain fr about an hour and then it was back, and somehow I ended up with a UTI at the same time, so I got meds for that. Really...all I wanted from them was something for the everyday, all the time, debilitating pain so I can go about my days more comfortably. I cant eat. I cant sleep because I cant get comfortable.

Hello, 
Sorry for the long read but I can’t really explain my situation with out some background. Thanks 

 So basically I was diagnosed April, put on mesalamine (oral) after my extremely mild colonoscopy (only got one because I had a couple weeks of loose stool and thought it was weird only going once a day no issues) anyways I was on mesalamine for about 4-5 months and I started to fall into a flare pretty slowly (took about a month of unshaped stool and smelling awful) I finally started to bleed horribly for a month and lost almost 30 lbs. got put on predisone while I’m taking the mesalamine and the pred did pretty much nothing other than give me a diet and make my face weird. 1 month later my doctor schedules me another colonoscopy because he has never seen such a mild case go south so fast. As we schedule he gives me a prescription for budenside (uceris).

Meanwhile we are both talking about why my UC took a turn for the worse (this is my first flare btw) I mention everything has pretty much gone bad since I was diagnosed which was the same time I started mesalamine. I ask if that’s why I’m flaring? He says it can’t be and it’s very very unlikely. 

Well I try the budenside and I asked if I can try stoping the mesalamine for a week and see what happens, he agrees. Not even 3 days later I’m pooping amazing. Zero blood, once a day, zero diarrhea and a month of this I begin to gain my weight back And I’m almost back to normal. 

I get my second colonoscopy and it’s even better looking than my first one. He can’t visibly see any disease. Okay well now I tell him I never got back on the mesalamine and he’s like “okay I didn’t want you off of it for that long”. At this point I’m still not sure if it was because of the budisinide or the stopping of the Mesalamine that my body bounced back to being normal. 

Follow up appointment like two weeks after my colonoscopy he says we need to get me off budenside and back on mesalamine. I express my feelings toward mesalamine and he says just to try it and go from there. And stay on budesnide for another 15 days. 

well lo and behold I take the mesalamine in the morning and the next morning (mornings are my poop time) I am having violent diarrhea. One day, okay what ever it might just be a fluke. So I stopped the mesalamine for the next day and I poop relatively normal. So I go back and try the mesalamine and woke up at 5am to have mild diarrhea. And now I’m sitting in bed writing this because I feel like I’m going mad and I can’t be this crazy to feel like the mesalamine is causing this. Even people in this sub have told me the mesalamine isn’t the reason i am flaring. 

Btw I’m still on budenside and today I’m going to not take mesalamine and see what happens. My doctor is afraid of me being on no drugs but at this point I know I need to get off mesalamine, right!?

Thanks for reading, I’m in bed and it’s too early to get up so I needed to get this out and see if I’m not seeing something that would make sense to why all of a sudden I’m beginning to flare again. 


TLDR: mild case of UC, took some mesalamine and have been living in hell for the last 6 months.",2020-02-10 15:38:23

Still on 20 mg prednisone and on iron tablets. I went to the foot doctor last week and started antibiotics amox-clav for an ingrown toenail that has been bothering me. I started the antibiotics on Wednesday and today (Sunday) my stools were a bit looser then normal. The first 3 were formed into semi fluffy logs ( sorry for the detail) and the last one was just a blob with mucus sitting on the top. I talked to my GI before taking the antibiotics and he said it was fine but to call him if I had diarrhea. I read online it’s probably from the antibiotics messing up the good bacteria in the gut and it goes away when you cease medication. I’m worried it could be c-diff though and I’m leaving the country on Friday for a week and I would hate to cancel my trip. Any advice ? Should I ask my foot doctor tomorrow when I see her for the operation if I can stop the antibiotics early ? Has anyone had bowel movements like this when on antibiotics ?,2020-02-10 04:09:37

I started Mesalamine ~8 weeks ago and I am feeling loads better! No more bad discomfort and blood/mucus, with 2-3 bowel movements a day (i tend to get constipated during flares, so this is a good thing i think).  I’ve also been slowly increasing my consumption of vegetables recently and I’ve been tolerating them very well compared to my flare!

The only things I am worried about now is my abdominal tenderness. I don’t get the same bad type of discomfort that I had in my flare, but sometimes I feel bloated and I’ll touch my stomach and I feel discomfort. This usually occurs after eating.  Furthermore, I’ve noticed that eating coconut ice cream (i’m dairy free) can make my stomach kind of upset, which is new.

I see my doctor towards the end of March for a follow up, but she said that if I’m still experiencing symptoms that I can call and she’ll put in an order for a steroid enema if I feel I need it.

What do you guys think? Should I worry about it or just wait?

I my name is Scott, I work as a psychologist & I also have Crohn's Disease. I help my clients work through anxiety & depression and often incorporate the skill of mindfulness meditation.

I have found personally in my life that mindfulness has been a game changer for me to be able to handle stress better and thereby cause less flares. Working full time & having a toddler keeps me having to be on my A game when it comes to not letting stress build up :-)

I'm trying to help people with Colitis, Crohn's & IBS to come together and learn in a like minded group of people who have shared struggles. If you are interested here's a free live webinar I'll be host next week.

**Side Note:**  
Info about addressing psychological & emotional stress is an important gap in resources for us people with IBD that is informed & indicated by the research.

My intention is to continue to create & share info about this topic for the community.  Full disclosure that I offer an online course for people with chronic GI problems to learn mindfulness but I honestly am not trying to spam or advertise as my main priority with this & future posts.

I personally have had Crohn's for 10+ years & am a licensed clinical psychologist, not some douche trying to make some quick internet money.

Because of the biologic as many of you know, you can’t have live vaccinations.

Turns out I’m not immune to MMR (all three, had the vaccination when I was younger just didn’t develop/sustain adequate immunity). This cause a bit of a hassle in terms of qualifying for my hospital placements, (lots of forms, doctor’s visits, medical notes and so on).

Whilst I’ve still got a ways to go yet, I’d love to also complete a medical degree later on down the track.

149,Newly Diagnosed - My Story + Some Questions,,8,f2jc9n,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/f2jc9n/newly_diagnosed_my_story_some_questions/,6,"Hello all!
I'm a 23 y/o female and as of yesterday, February 10, I was diagnosed with mild ulcerative colitis. The doctor said specifically that only the left side was inflamed but I'm not exactly sure what that means, but he really emphasized that I'm on the very mild side because I lack majority of the symptoms. 

MY STORY: because I couldn't figure it out for the life of me what it was because the symptoms were so mild.

I've had an issue since October 2019. My symptoms were mild diarrhea, occasional bloating that could be fixed with one gas-x pill, and bright red blood with occasional mucous (and going to the restroom 1-2 times every day even though what's normal for me is once every 2-3 days). The blood is what scared me the most and I even went to the ER because of it but left with 0 answers after being there for 12 hours. I had horrible insurance at the time and it took 3 weeks to see a doctor only for him to just tell me it could be hemorrhoids or something worse like IBD or cancer and that it would take 9 weeks to get a call from a GI. During that waiting time, I made the horrible mistake of googling everything to see if I could do a little process of elimination myself, cause your girl has anxiety and it's all I could think about. All the stuff I found on UC/IBD absolutely terrified me because all I saw were the severe stories or horror scenarios and my biggest fear out of my Google results is getting a stoma, especially at a young age (mad props to those of you with a bag and are confidently rocking it and living). I foolishly thought I could tick off IBD because I wasn't in pain, I wasn't cramping, nauseous, light headed and my blood results were normal. In late november, the bleeding had stopped on its own and everything went back to normal so I figured it was a hemorrhoid or a fissure and thought nothing of it...till it came back a month ago. 
Still no pain, no cramping, no nausea or any other symptoms other than oddly loose stools, a sour tummy, and blood. Thankfully, I decided to switch to a private insurance back in January because I made like $2 over the limit for medicare but paying a little bit out of pocket is totally worth it because I saw a doctor and a GI all in the span of 3 weeks which is INSANE to me because I'm used to that free insurance life with waiting months on end.

So I had a sigmoidoscopy yesterday and was told I have very mild ulcerative colitis. My heart dropped at first and I immediately started crying and thinking ""this is it. Im going to have a poop bag sometime in my life"". But he then explained to me that I'm very misinformed. He told me that UC ranges from mild to moderate to severe and said I'm very fortunate because I'm on the the mild side because I don't have any major symptoms other than blood, loose stools, and gas. He told me that he is very confident that I will most likely live a very normal life and he was very confident that the anti-inflammatory medication is going to be more than enough for me since my UC is so mild and if it works well enough for me that I can go from 4 pills a day down to 2 in 6 months. He said my chances of it ever getting worse are pretty low and generally less than 25% of people do end up getting progressively worse. So after hearing all that, I ended up being not *as* upset as I thought I would be. Sure, I'm upset and slightly depressed about it because I'm pretty healthy but I'm so relieved to finally have an answer. 

The medication he is starting me on is Mesalamine and I'm crossing my fingers it works for me. I have yet to start it because the pharmacy is out at the moment but it'll be in stock in a few more days. Thankfully I don't really have any allergies to medications so we'll see!

QUESTIONS: 

So because I was in the middle of my world crashing down, I forgot to ask questions that were kind of important but also I had some questions spark up when reading some of the threads on here...

1. How do you know when you're in a flare up? I feel like for me it'll be hard to tell when one is coming on because my symptoms are so *mild*.. that and I feel like some symptoms are hard to tell especially when it could be something else like the flu or food poisoning and I've always dealt with a gassy stomach so I don't know if I'll be able to tell the difference between normal gas or a flare up.

2. Can you prevent a flare up?

3. What do you do to make a flare up go away quickly? Or what do you do differently during a flare up? (I.e medication, diet, etc)

4. Do probiotics help? If so, do you take them all the time or only during a flare up? What strain is most helpful?

5. Can something cause a flare up? Like spicy food or stress or something ? Or does nothing particularly cause flare ups?

6. How do you know when you're in remission? 

7. If you're in remission, does that mean my bowel movements will go back to normal?

8. If what he says is true, the body doesn't become immune to the medication inevitably leading to more serious treatments and whatnot? Or is that only for unfortunate 25% that do end up progressively getting worse? Is there a possibility that the medication I'll be taking will work for many many years without having to increase dosage?

I think that's all the questions I have.
Thank you for reading my story and for any advice that you have.",2020-02-12 02:51:49

I could still remember the first year I was diagnosed with UC, I was a freshman just starting university, but because of my condition I had to stop eveything. In these past 5 years, there was hope everytime a new medication was injected into me. Hope that I could go back to school, hope that I could lead a normal life, but that hope always get crushed in the end.
As of now, the doctors feared that if this keeps on, my colon won't hold any longer so my family and I finally decided to go through surgery. Doctors promised that this could be life changing, even if its a tad bit inconvenient.
I want to hope, but with the things I've experienced, I don't want to get let down again. It's hard to go to bed these days without the thought of losing a part of me which is my colon. I felt that I've missed something, I can't shake off the feeling that it feels like I chose surgery because I gave up fighting as all these years I kept hoping that a cure might come soon.

Of course that's it me and my family into a deep depression while we're waiting for the results. I'm thinking I'm probably got a couple of months to live or something like that. So I started telling on my closest friends and teachers that I had cancer.

I'm finally feeling better in that regard and have my appetite back, but now I find that eating food is not sitting great with me. I'm not dealing with extreme urgency, but it feels like food is just passing through me and I'm getting a lot of cramps and gas. I've been going to the bathroom a lot, far more than before I caught this cold, and I'm not sure if this is something that'll resolve itself in a few days or not. Does anyone have experience with something like this? I want to gain the weight back and not be dealing with going to the bathroom so often.

I was treated and that was that, or so I thought.. Less then 2 weeks later I started getting lower abdominal pain, the NP I was seeing told me it was likely UC with proctitis and put me on antibiotics for several weeks. Well the pain was not there at all and I could eat like my old self with no complaints. Once I was done with my antibiotics the pain came back and with a vengeance.. she said that the pain was normal and that I should take Advil twice a day and the symptoms should reside. I took her advice and stayed in excruciating pain until mid January when a doc I work with suggested high dose Tylenol, take 3000mg spread out throughout the day and it’s helped a lot. My pain went from a 5-8 to about a 1-2. Within the last week I’ve had a few days were my symptoms were barely noticeable. I don’t know what remission is because I’ve just been in constant pain. I found this sub hoping to find help but have become overwhelmed by all the pain each and one of you experience. I know it’s an echo chamber of hurt in here and I keep trying to tell my self that this isn’t the end and that I’ll get better. I feel like I’ve been living that day back in September.. I was a healthy, active and a very happy person. I’m trying to figure out what I can eat and what I can do to get myself in remission, if that’s even possible. I see a new doctor (just got insurance finally) and hope I can start steroids to be a bit more aggressive on healing. Most days I feel my proctitis more so then my UC so maybe that’s progress and now I just need to focus on that. I’ve been living this nightmare for months and I just don’t want to see my future as having this the rest of my life. I’ve turned into quite the vegetarian but still trying to figure out which foods are okay or not, I’ve lost about 40lbs since the start of this. Anyways I thought I’d share my story and that Im sorry to all of you who suffer through this. See my new doctor later this week and I hope there’s some relief coming. 
Thanks for listening.

Edit: thank you everyone who’s replies, I woke up in a dark place this morning and everyone’s helped me get through my mental block. Going to take some of the wonderful advice and get some new groceries tonight.

I sat for over an hour on my couch waiting to see if something would happen. All the while googling if someone out there had a similar experience. It's been about 4 hours now and still fine. I'm sure i'll be alright. \*\*touch wood\*\*

I found it weird how UC has changed my mindset. I got worried that the stings might trigger some reaction and how I've got to be more cautious going forward and stressing that this could be the end of my remission etc.. UC is a real pain in ass and mind in guess.

Hi everyone, My husband and I have developed a new resource for Ulcerative Colitis and request your opinion and feedback.

My husband has been diagnosed with UC nearly 10 years ago, we have been together for 7 years. Before we met, his first 3 years of UC, he struggled to control his symptoms with medication. When we met, we started researching better ways to control his US: we did allergy testing, gut bacteria mapping, saw naturopathic doctors,  read peer-review journals that publish serious research on UC, and tried every diet there is to try.

We are not doctors, but we are 2 PhD researchers who were motivated to educate ourselves and find scientific ways of improving symptoms and quality of life.

From all this experience, we have scientifically designed a diet that has kept husband in deep remission for 4 years to this day: no pain, no bleeding, no inflammation (normal C-reactive protein). He has felt better than at any time before.

We have created a website to share our experience: out research, our diet, our recipes, our tips for travelling with UC and getting through flares.

The website is : [https://thecolitisblog.com/](https://thecolitisblog.com/)

We would like to request your feedback on this website before we launch it.

Please let us know:

* what do you think of the content?
* what kind of information would you like to see that is not already there?

Thank you. We can't wait to hear from you.",2020-02-17 21:50:36

Today I understand the illness much better than when I was first diagnosed or even just a couple years ago.  Today I understand that for me at least, my UC flares up mostly only after I get really frustrated/worked up at work which causes anxiety for me.  Flare ups also occur after going to the gym and lifting too much weight which for whatever reason causes me inflammation, which causes me to bleed, which in turn, causes anxiety at work/personal life, which causes depression.  The only medicines I have found to be truly effective are benzo drugs which help immediately and long term but long term, they have very negative side effects.  I am currently taking Apriso .375g x4 per day for UC maintenence with canasa 1g at night during a flare, pepcid ac 40mg 2x daily for reflux,  and trazadone 50mg once at night and am starting remeron again currently at 7.5 once daily at night both trazadone and remeron are for anxiety/depression.

My pains were so extreme that I often times couldn’t breath until I blacked out. I’d come back and get a few breaths until the pain became extremely bad again. I luckily made it to the hospital one time it happened. Out of all 8 times I made it once. It immobilized me and pretty much paralyzed me the pain was so bad. So the one time I made it to the hospital. I was given four or five steriods, 6 or 7 anti inflammatory medications, and none of it worked for an hour. So for an hour I experienced pain that made me want to die. Unable to breath. Blacking out and waking back up. Until the medicine finally started to work. Then I fell asleep from the exhaustion. I stayed in the hospital for a good while and woke up with my parents there and my buddy still there. It was probably 12 hours later. 

I already know there’ll be one or two to say it didn’t happen but I have the medical documentation in writing because I needed it for work. So your opinion is invalid to me. 


But I said all that to say this, I absolutely hate people that discredit what we go through. The women said my pain probably was no worse than extreme period cramps.

i know this topic has probably been posted a thousand times on here before but i’m considering surgery and am looking for some advice and opinions.

i was diagnosed in 2015 at 19 and since then have exhausted most options since. was started on prednisone, budesonide and apriso immediately after diagnosis without much effect. i was quickly prescribed humira, which did nothing for me. my first gi (thankfully) referred me to an ibd specialist at ochsner who has been great, but it’s been a struggle getting any good results. since then i have been on and failed:

•humira
•remicade 
•entyvio
•mesalamine and cortisone enemas
•all varieties of diets

i also had a bad bout with c diff during which time i was having about 18 bowel movements per day all while attending college and working. needless to say this was the lowest point of my illness.

i ended up on The Great Satan prednisone for about 3 years before i was finally weaned off, and i refuse to take it anymore.

i finally got some good results after being on a foam hydrocortisone enema (which has since been discontinued by the manufacturer 🙃) and xeljanz. i was having 2-4 bowel movements per day which to me was the greatest thing in the world. this lasted about a year and then in september of 2019 i flared up again. i’ve been battling this flare ever since. despite increasing my xeljanz dose and trying cortisone and mesalamine enemas i am still having 4-8 loose, sometimes bloody stools a day.  i have no appetite, have lost almost 30 pounds since september, and am just generally feeling terrible constantly.

i just got approved for stelara, a biologic which was recently approved for treatment of ulcerative colitis. i want to exhaust all options before resorting to surgery, but time is not on my side.

i’ll turn 25 this april, and after that it’s a year before i’m kicked off my mom’s insurance. assuming there isn’t some miraculous change in our insurance/healthcare system, i will never have better coverage than i do now. that’s why i’m considering forgoing stelara and asking my gi to refer me to a surgeon before it’s too late.

i was just wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation and what their outcome was like. i’m thinking about quality of life at this point. it’s been almost 5 years and i’m tired of feeling like shit.

any input is appreciated.

sending good vibes to all of y’all. thanks.",2020-02-18 18:45:44

I've got fairly mild ulcerative colitis with my symtopms only being bloating, loose/soft stools and blood and sometimes mucous. I haven't had any pain at all since this all started and felt generally normal aside from annoying gas/bloating and whatnot. 

However since the medication I've had some new pain, like a 1/10 dull pain and other symptoms like fatigue and slight shortness of breath and an achy body, etc. Unfortunately I started my medication the same day I started my lady day so I don't know if fatigue is caused by that or the meds.

So is this my body adjusting to being on 0 meds to 4.8 g a day? Are these side effects? If so, are they forever or only temporary until I adjust?
How would I know if I have an intolerance to the medication? And how do I know if they are side effects and not my UC getting worse? That's a big fear of mine as I'm sure it is for most other people. 

On the brighside since taking it I've gone from using the restroom twice a day to once and for the first time today there was no blood and things are hardening up a bit finally. 

Thanks in advance!",2020-02-18 05:45:56

My GI is leaning towards thinking that since I am going into surgery anyway, perhaps it would be good idea to get the surgery for UC (ileostomy) done at the same time.. especially since I’m in middle of a flare (although have improved heaps in last two months). I don’t know what to do so would love some input. Here’s my UC story so far - 

Been showing symptoms for about 2 years but finally got diagnosed properly about 2 months ago when I had high fevers and BM’s about 15 times a day, each with blood and mucus. Lost lot of weight, blood and was anemic when I went to hospital. Baffles me that I let me health slip so much.. 

Got admitted in December, they started me on prednisone, mesalazine/Pentasa/Lialda and Remicade. Showed some improvements so was discharged home after two weeks. About a week later the flare got worse again and was back on the hospital. This time they ran additional tests (which incidentally found cancer on the kidney) but ultimately symptoms got better again and I was discharged after another two weeks on the same medicine. Tomorrow I have my third dose for Remicade. 

Improvements - since first treatment, my BM’s have gone from 15 to 4. I rarely see blood or mucus (although this week hasn’t been a great one). My blood tests have been generally improving with respect to blood counts and CRP. And I am putting on weight. So all things are pointing in the right direction. Symptomatically I am feeling quite good and feel that I can do 80% of things. Likely starting back at work next week. 

Except I have to have a surgery soon. I don’t want to rush into getting a UC surgery just because I’m having one for kidney and I also don’t want to delay the cancer surgery just to see how bowels are going. 

So while I do have a GI appointment and a sigmoidoscopy before the kidney operation, my thinking is that unless I get into a horrible flare again in next two weeks, I am going to refuse getting the UC surgery at this stage and get the kidney surgery done alone. I will likely go with this plan even if GI says otherwise. My only concern is that at this stage my UC maybe under control because of prednisone which I haven’t been able to taper down as much as I would have liked and I’m coming up to 2 months on prednisone. What’s the maximum can I stay on prednisone?

&#x200B;

Hope you're all as well as can be. I wanted to share something I found, which I think may be of some benefit. My medication (Lialda), with insurance, is over $800 a month. I find this unacceptably high, for myself, or anyone just to be able to live a normal life. 

So, I started researching, and found some sites like rxhope... etc... these sites charge you a monthly fee for something you can do for free, yourself. There are numerous patient assistance programs available, at no cost to the patient. The one I specifically applied to is called Takeda Pharmaceuticals- Help at Hand.

Help at Hand patient assistance is free of charge; all you need to do is apply for coverage. Basically, if you qualify, you can get the listed medications for your condition at absolutely no cost! I submitted my application and I am waiting to hear back. Now, please call to find out more information for your situation..... I believe the income cap for a family of four is around $120k a year, which was surprising to me. I make decent money, but I can certainly use the help because the cost for me will affect how much I can save for retirement and my childrens college funds. 

Hope this helps!

It's not just the cramping. It's not just the bloating. It's not just the scarring. It's not just the endless appointments. It's not just the tests. It's not just the medication. 

It's also the fact that it will keep me from doing 100% of the things I want to do. It's the fact that I am always going to live in terror of not having a job with good health insurance, because I need it to live/not have life crushing debt. I'm tired of trying to look at it as some boon. Some benefit that somehow changed out I look at the world. How I deal with stress. 

But mostly, I'm just so very fucking tired. I'm tired of the daily fight my body puts up. I'm tired of knowing that my own immune system is trying to kill \*me\*. I'm tired of feeling the way I do so very often. And the real bitch of all of this - I never get a break. Ever. There's no pause button with this disease. It's always there. Most days, there's some pain or discomfort that I have to deal with. Days like today, I really, really wish I could just get a day or two where there's just nothing. And that just is not in the cards for me. 

So yeah, I'm going to keep fighting. This isn't over. Not by a long shot. 

But goddamn, I just want a break from it all. Just for a little bit.

Also note my last scope showed still some mild active disease in my transverse/descending colon. Plus I’m on lomotil and not eating during the day and bingeing at night and still going to the bathroom 6 times a day. I’m fed up with this disease. I was diagnosed in 2010 and still have never been in remission. So the doctor is switching me to entyvio it’s been over a month and the insurance company is still denying it.

Then right before all this starts snowballing I ask my dr if he thinks I’m healthy enough to get a new tattoo. He gives me the go ahead because I’m not having to many issues healing cuts/scrapes. So last second we decide maybe it’s not the best idea. Well I would of been put $200. So he says go for it just be overly cautious. Guess who now has an infection. 

Sometimes I just want to enjoy life. I want that beer and pizza for dinner tonight with friends, I want that new tattoo. I want to be able to spontaneously have a date night with my boyfriend. And I can’t do any of this.

I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis back in 2015, and after a year of taking what felt like every tablet under the sun I still couldn’t get on top of it. I elected for surgery and on the 12th Jan 2016 I had a subtotal colectomy to remove my large bowel. Since then things have been great, no more pills! 
Fast forward and I’m now in my final year of university at Liverpool John Moores, with hopes of being a dietician in the near future and helping people with various illnesses including IBD.
As part of my final year I have to complete a research project of my own, so I’m hoping some wonderful people on here could give me a hand. It’s a four question survey that focuses on what people with IBD eat and why? Do you follow any specific diet? Where do you go to get your advice? Feel free to write as much or as little as you like. There’s a ton more info on the study if you follow the link, as well as my official uni contact info if you have any questions. Don’t hesitate to ask! Also if you just want to ask me on here about my own experiences with UC, or what it’s like to live with an ileostomy I’m happy to chat.
Anyone who wants to take part must be 18 and living in the UK. Thanks for reading everyone and I really appreciate any help you can give.

I've been going 1-2 times per day. Sometimes just once. But today I noticed a spec of red on one of my stools. It could be blood or perhaps the red from some greens I ate the past couple of days? 

On another note, sometimes I notice my stools float sometimes they sink... anyone have a similar occurance?

So I started Balsalazide the other day and it’s awesome!! It’s relieving to see finally no blood after having it for a while. Still kinda runny stools but hey I’m getting somewhere. Anyways, although this is working great for my body, I’ve been having some pretty bad side effects. I’ve been having a cough, dry throat, and flemmy coughs lately... I was wondering if any of you have had Balsalazide and been having side effects? It’s on the internet, but idk if it’s for real or common or if I should be concerned for flu or other things and get it checked out because the recent sicknesses around have been a bit scary and I’m paranoid haha. Anyways, thanks.

So, never a good way to start a rant, but anyway, I had a flare up day before yesterday and I've had mild ones and not so mild ones. This one woke me out of a dead sleep to the symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea. Great way to start the day, I hoveled over to the john hoping it wasn't a flair but a bad case of indigestion. But I wasn't so lucky. Little background for me, I got diagnosed back in March of 2018 with mild to moderate UC, at the time I was pursuing my military career and was working towards bettering myself. The military Dr. prescribed Imuran for symptoms and Prednisone for the immediate flare and get this 800mg ibprofen for pain. To take daily no less. I ended up getting medically discharged for it which in turn ruined my chances of staying in for 20yrs and getting that oh so sweet pension. But life happens right?  I'm getting sidetracked my bad, it's day 3 I'd say I'm at a balmy 60% of full health and I'm out to a family dinner and I just hate this, I hate feeling like this, I try to job hunt and then a flare happens and I'm like "" how am I supposed to work when I don't even want to move, walk, to eat?"" And let me say about the eating, I'm literally afraid to eat food, and that sucks. I love food, hell I'm even fat from loving food maybe a little too much. But I don't know. I take Lialda oral and suppository, and Budesonide. 

Does anyone else go through this? I can't be the only one, right?",2020-02-21 04:05:41

Got my UC diagnosis just this past week and had a consult with my GI today.

He was really pushing for self injection but I know myself and I know that I won’t be able too(needle phobia). I watched a youtube video on how to do it and started having a panic attack so bad I almost threw up. So I guess that just leaves me with transfusions if the pill doesn’t work out.

Is anyone else facing a shortage of actual (non-generic) Lialda at their pharmacies? I've taken it for years with great success, then had an insurance change that put me on the competing generic (not real Lialda with the generic classification nonsense, but a pill with a markedly duller coating, smell, etc). I don't feel the generic has been as effective and was stuck with three months of it. Another insurance change first of the year has made genuine Lialda an option again, but it's been impossible to get where I live. Both CVS and WalMart have spent weeks unable to get it.

I finally called the manufacturer who read me a prepared statement (nothing like your support person being turned into a human robot) that said there was increased demand and they couldn't keep up. They expected to overcome the issue by January 20th (I was hearing this in early February, so clearly they missed that deadline) or ""in the coming months"". Nice weasel words there. The whole thing sounded like BS to me as to the cause for the shortage. 

In any case, I've been surprised to not see other discussion on the matter. I suspect I'm back to the generic again this week for however long it takes for this to get sorted out in the industry. I did score one bottle of Lialda (the last one in local inventory) at the end of my three month generic stint and that is what is running out this week. Yes, things were more normal during this month.

I’ve gone through what feels like a series of non stop major flares. Stomach pain, bloating, exhaustion non stop trips to the bathroom etc. But what’s weird is that I’ll get constipated rather than having extreme diarrhea. It’s hard to describe, I definitely get the normal diarrhea at times, but most of the time I’m constipated. I’m on humira and I think it’s helping. I feel lucky I really haven’t had a major flare (to where I’m in the hospital or losing my job) since June of this year, which is about when I started the humira. 
But the symptoms and experiences of UC have made me afraid of food. So I barely eat. But then I have symptoms of IBS and have become so hyper aware of how my stomach feels that I became paranoid. Anyway when I’m not in a major flare or even sometimes when I’m having all the symptoms of a flare (fever, exhaustion etc) I’m not able to have a normal bowel movement, I have to use a stimulant laxative about twice a week. Because I’ve become so hyper aware of my stomach I barely eat. I have myself convinced that the less food I eat the less symptoms I’ll experience. I’m pretty sure that’s not medically true but it seems to work for me. Anyway, I read somewhere that there are several types of UC and I read that one type of UC includes major constipation, sort of a reverse of the norm. Does anyone else experience this? I still get the normal flare symptoms and GI issues but in between flares I am unable to go to the bathroom without laxatives.",2020-02-22 23:45:14

I've had 5 infusions since then. I was recently diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in October. I had a lot of blood in my stool. I was put on apriso and then on prednisone. The bleeding and diarrhea get worse and start experiencing pain. I ended up in the hospital late October and doctors put me on remicade. I had 3 infusions within 2 weeks then one in December and then one last week. As of 2 to 3 weeks ago there hasn't been that much blood and I was feeling better.  I got the infusion on Thursday and by monday I was a mess and have been a mess since then. There is solid white puss in my stool now. My doctor sent me a random message my remicade level was a bit low but it was ok. He didnt realize I've had 5 infusions. 

I'm beginning to believe most of the things I'm experiencing are side effects from all of these drugs. A month ago along with the remicade I was on apriso, prednisone, budesonide, flagyl and vancomycin.  I stopped all of the drugs and I feel better. 

In short before drugs only bleeding, temporary neuropathy and joint pains were my symptoms. 

After i start taking medication everything goes completely crazy.

I’m turning 26 in Nov and have been receiving treatment via Kaiser under my parent’s insurance. I’m really starting to get worried aka stressed about finding a full time position that will get me out of living this minimum wage lifestyle, and to be set up for health benefits come Nov. I haven’t even been able to work 20+ hours a week lately at my current job due to the current condition of my flare up, and when i am working, I know that my coworkers/superiors have to pick up my slack when i leave my patient to do my thing. It just doesn’t work out. I’m running out of sick hours and I’m running out of money. Any time spent at home, I feel crippled in bed or on the toilet with pain. I get ~3-4 hours of broken sleep a night if im lucky and im just exhausted 24/7. I dont know how id be able to pick up full time hours or work under these conditions.  

I’ve been wanting to leave my current job for something else since the end of last year but thought I would do so once this flare up calms down and I’m better health-wise. 4 months later and it’s worse than before and im running out of time before I probably wont be able to afford medications/treatments on top of my current bills. 

For what it’s worth, I have a BS in Human Biology but it feels/seems like it’s a deadend degree at this point if I dont go med/health field like i originally planned. At this point, I need something fast, and pursuing grad school or another health related field would demand a minimum of 3-5 more years of schooling which I honestly dont think i have the money, time, mindset, energy, or health to commit to at the moment.

When I went there to work out my stomach became kind of irritated but not enough to worry me yet. But towards the end of the workout I HAD to go. My stomach started cramping and I did the old man holding his stomach and dying run towards the bathrooms which were BOTH LOCKED. I turned around to find a place to go but in 5 steps my body started  to unload. Out of pure instinct I pulled down my pants and just started shitting uncontrollably next to the side of this little building for the bathrooms but I was in clear eyesight of everyone at the park and the houses on the side of the street. I didn’t even realize that I had my pants down because it happened so fast and when I looked up I was in pure panic mode thinking what the fuck did I just do. HOWEVER, everyone at park actually had sympathy and understood because they saw the way I ran to the bathroom and tugged on the door handles like a madman. 

So I’m super embarrassed but I’m glad the parents at the park were not disgusted with me. We actually laughed about it after I explained to a pair that I had UC. 
But My adrenaline was pumping so hard at the moment. It was a terrible experience but now I feel like I actually can’t get any more embarrassed than that. That had set the bar too high lmao.

I am looking for some advice or to see if any of you have experienced something similar. It just seems like everytime I start to get a little better I get worse all over again and I am not sure what to do anymore. 

I am a 25 year old female UC patient. I've been on many different medications, all stopped working after a while.  Tried remicade, azathioprine, Lialda and enemas. 

I am now on Entyvio and Lialda pills. I have been on 40mg of Prednisone since August when I ended up in the hospital from a terrible flare. 

I have gained a ton of weight which I'm trying to loose. It makes it really hard to do things I used to do and most of my clothing doesn't fit anymore. 
I developed painful stretch marks and daily lower back and hip pain. I know most of this is from being on prednisone for so long which I've been trying to get my doctor to get me off of. He's been waiting to see if the Entyvio will kick in before tapering me down to avoid me going back into a flare. 

Since it seemed like the Entyvio was starting to work I started tapering my prednisone and am now on 30mg. I was doing ok but this last week I've started having rectal bleeding again as well as fecal incontinence, fatigue and acid reflux. All the great things UC gives you.

I'm not sure if I'm experiencing side effects from the medications or what is going on. I just am so tired of not feeling well and not feeling like my doctor is giving me clear answers. Just looking for a little guidance, if any of you have advice or personal experiences with any of this. 

Thanks!",2020-02-25 01:38:14

- wash your hands after touching doorknobs and shaking hands with people(obvious )
- when in public bathrooms use your foot to open the door in.
-use your foot to pull open the stall door and then grab a piece of toilet paper to close it and lock it.
- line the toilet seat with toilet paper and put a bunch of it in the toilet as well so your poop doesn’t cause the water to splash up
-use toilet paper to turn on the tap when washing your hands and also to turn it off. Also use paper towel to open the door to leave or wait for someone to open it for you if there’s only blow dryers. If there’s only blow dryers I grab a piece of toilet paper from the stall.
- this might not be necessary but I’ll change my clothes when I get home if I’ve been out in a public place for awhile.

I’ve been in hospital for the last 3 days with pancreatitis, this is the second time since early January that this has happened. I was diagnosed with UC on December 6th last year and was put on mesalazine, then on the 8th of January this year I woke up in excruciating pain in my abdomen, rushed to the hospital and was admitted for 6 days with pancreatitis. Some doctors told me they think it was caused by the mesalazine as it can be a rare side effect. So I stopped taking that and 2 weeks after I left hospital I saw my gastroenterologist again and he prescribed me sulfasalazine. Been on that for 3 weeks and I woke up again 3 days ago with the same excruciating pain, went to hospital and they confirmed pancreatitis again. From my own research I found that sulfasalazine can cause pancreatitis as a rare but well known side effect but the doctors are not convinced that that’s what caused it but there is no other explanation. I’m so worried that whatever he will put me on next will give me pancreatitis again :( I’m due to see him on Wednesday. Has anyone else had this same problem and found a medication that doesn’t cause pancreatitis?? It’s honestly the worst pain I have felt and I never want to go through this again.

Been in the hospital for the past two days now. They can pinpoint exactly what’s wrong but are certain it’s some sort of virus. Checked for flu, pneumonia, and meningitis, all negative. Infectious dr thinks it’s due to the imuran and prednisone and i haven’t had them since Wednesday.

I had called my specialist Wednesday about the medicine and the only just got back to me today which was frustrating, and then told them I’ve been in the hospital and had stopped the medication but the nurse who called me sounded shocked that i stopped taking the stuff abruptly and that she’d pass it on to the dr and get back with me.

This is a bit of a follow-up on my previous post: [Currently hospitalized for 3 weeks, need help/advice Hey all!](https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/j0oewl/currently_hospitalized_for_3_weeks_need_helpadvice/)

So its now been 6 days since the second Infliximab infusion, and my blood results did not improve that much over the week. In fact, I've had anemia and required 3 blood transfusions + 1 iron transfusion during this week. My CRP is still dwindling on 10, and the fever still comes and goes once or twice a day if I do not take paracetamol to ""hide"" it.

I'm still feeling fine, without any abdominal pain or cramps, good appetite and energy for most of the day (when there's no fever), but the doctors did another scope and the mucosa in my colon is still severely deteriorated, full of ulceras and pretty much only the intestinal muscle is left which could lead to perforations or complications later on.

With this situation, the doctors have already decided that the total colectomy is the way to go for now. They say its much better to do it now while i'm stable, feeling okay rather than waiting longer and having to do it with urgency after a perforation or other undesirable situations. 

I have already talked to the surgeon, which from what I was told is the leading surgeon from UC/Chrons in my region, and of the best in the country, and the plan is to do the 3 step IPAA surgery, where first I do the ileostomy and get a stoma for a few months/year, and eventually once im stable they will do the J-pouch and restore the flow.

There was always hope in me that I would get much better this week, or that the surgery would be later on and that maybe the Infliximab would give more results in the following weeks and prevent it, but now I have already accepted that if a severe flare like this happened once and the medications are failing to work, then maybe in the future it could worsen which would lead to possible hospitalisations, pain, and a lower quality of life.

For now, I'm keeping a positive state of mind and after reading sucess stories here on Reddit of people who had this surgery, I am hoping to be walking around on Sunday on the hospital block, and being back home as soon as possible! I also will have to find a name for my stoma :P

If anyone has experience with this surgery I would gladly read them and discuss to keep my mind positive until Saturday! Have a nice one :)",2020-10-01 17:03:52

My primary physician immediately ruled out colitis, even after mentioning my mother had issues with it before. Instead, she told me to pay better attention to what I was eating. I'm overweight, so I assumed this was all my fault and I just needed to control my diet. I have been hating myself for not being able to find out what food it is - I could never find a pattern.

I finally ended up in the ER this week for nonstop vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. My male ER doctor made comments outside my room suggesting he wasnt taking me seriously, that I didn't need pain medication. He was ready to send me home after stopping the nausea and putting me on fluids to fix the dehydration. I again blamed myself, had I done something to make me vomit for 6 hours straight? Was I wasting their time and resources?

I am very thankful I had an amazing ER nurse, who I overheard advocating for me - telling the dr. to ""just look!"" at me (referencing my pale face, blue lips. I have never seen myself look like that). 

Because of her insistence, I was given a CT scan. The scan showed colitis (and some other undiasgnosed issues!) and then admitted to the hospital for 3 days.

     I will make this a short as possible, but I was able to stop diarrhea completely for an entire month so far. I am not saying that this will work for anybody else, but for me it’s been absolutely astonishment. 

I had posted on here before about only being hospitalized in the spring months, always march / may time frame and they are brutal (5 times in 15 years). I was coming to the conclusion that my extreme flair up symptoms could in fact be allergy related somehow. Allergy meds like zyzol and Claritin did nothing for me FYI....

Well, mom came to visit me and basically forced me to try two things, and I gave up arguing with her about it not going to do anything. 

I have not had diarrhea SINCE doing natural saline nasal flushes in the morning ( netty pot like Dwight from the office and Jim’s teapot), as well as the first week using a mucinex nasal spray. I may have some underlying sinus issues that I just never knew was a problem! This literally has changed my life, and incredibly quickly, shockingly quickly.

 I will say that I have been able to add vegetables back in my diet and suffered no diarrhea or undigested outcomes. 

I will  also say I tried a few trigger foods like red pasta sauce and although I didn’t have diarrhea as a result i did have thunder farts that will wake up the neighborhood and my poor wife. So those foods do not agree with me, but the result has not been a shitty mess.

I’m not saying this will work for anybody else, but I urged those who feel like they have similar symptoms as me not to ignore this as it could change your life in a fast way.

Good luck and I would love to hear feedback from others.",2020-10-04 20:35:00

When the topic of stomach pains comes up I somewhat loosely relate it to what I imagine period pains might be like.

IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE READING ON
I'm very careful about doing this, and I never bring it up as a way of comparison or competition (and I don't even pretend colitis gives me any right to say I've got any idea of the fullness of having a period is like). Also I only mention it if I know it won't be an uncomfortable thing to even gloss over for the person I'm talking with. And I've actually learnt a lot I didn't know about periods thanks to these cool women, and I guess they've learnt a bit about bowel conditions too.

Okay so continuing on I was thinking about this, and how all the women I have spoken about with it don't have colitis themselves... then it struck me... that many do.

And so, I'm just sitting here thinking how you girls who deal with periods AND colitis must be some of the toughest TROOPERS on the planet. I can't even begin to imagine how much you must hate your tummy sometimes. Yet you still crack on and get things done.

That's all I wanted to share, just that little thought. You women are badasses, certified and to a T. Keep hammering you awesome people! The world doesn't know your strength.",2020-10-04 08:11:50

I just politely thank them, they mean well, but it’s infuriating. My diet is already HUGELY restricted because I have food allergies. And I’ve tried all the diets. I know which foods trigger me. This is not about food. It feels dismissive and a little insulting when people suggest I could “just fix it with my diet.” It’s as if they think I’m not trying hard enough to heal, that I don’t want it badly enough.

My first specialist was a colorectal surgeon and he seemed to check in every few months and wanted to have follow ups. A change in insurance made me switch and I’m not seeing a gastroenterologist and the first consult was great and made me feel like they’d do better at treating me.

They had me do a colonoscopy a couple years ago to reconfirm that i had UC. They were able to put me back on mesalamine. Was fine for a while then nothing seemed to help but admittedly my diet choices were poor...

Had me do another colonoscopy in February this year. They switched me to prednisone and azathioprine. Told me they would see how i was doing in three months. Two weeks later i was in the hospital due to a reaction to the AZA.

After my hospital stay i made big changes to my diet and cut out caffein almost entirely. They tried me on AZA again two weeks after my hospital stay. Same symptoms came about after only two days of taking it so i immediately stopped. Called my specialist and they had me finish the mesalamine that i had left over. Everything seemed great after that point and was having solid stools once or twice a day. The mesalamine was holding me over.

Of course, Covid happened and i still have yet to hear from my specialist on any follow up appointment or anything. I’ve just been taking the mesalamine and been fine up until now. My wife and i are moving and it’s put a lot of stress on me and now I’m in a bad flare... but as long as i have been seeing this specialist it’s always been a headache just to even try and get a hold of them. Every time i call i have to leave a voicemail and wait for them to call me back. I’ve never had any follow up calls or to schedule any follow up appointments.

Up until last Friday they weren’t doing much. The flare was slowly getting worse: blood without stool, 7-8 bowel movements, unsustainable emergency, etc. 

However on last Friday I decided to go as deep as I possibly could with the foam. To put it blunt, you want the whole nozzle to go all the way in. When I used it like this it felt like the medication was in like some hidden chamber in my colon where it was tightly isolated. I’m now no longer seeing any blood and using the restroom 2-3 times a day. This was only after 3 days of ideal application. 

It’s going to hurt initially. I’d previously stop once I felt some pain because I was afraid of tearing something. Once you feel some pain really try to relax, and apply mild pressure. It’ll eventually naturally go all the way in with no pain. 

As a comparison, during prior used I would put a third of the nozzle in. When doing it this way it felt like I had to immediately use the restroom. 

Felt like making this because I couldn’t find any posts about proper application. But I urge you, before dismissing, budesonide please gradually work up the means for full insertion.",2020-10-05 16:57:59

I’m not gonna go through all that stuff though because I’m sure our doctors have all briefed us on COVID-19 safety, but here’s one thing that sucks if you do manage to catch covid19. In my city and state Chicago, IL, you cannot enter a hospital until you have one of two things, A. Two negative covid tests within 24 hours of each other, or B. No symptoms for 40 days after your initial positive covid test. 

I caught covid in late august, got my first positive test August 19th, my next infusion was set to be August 28th. Since you have to quarantine for 14 days I figured my Infusion was going to happen later than usual, no biggie I thought but then things just got worse, since I’m on Remicade, covid took a little longer to get through my body, I tested positive 6 times in the next few weeks trying to get that negative test so I can go back to the hospital and get my infusion before I flared up again. As of September 28th that was my day 40, I had covid but was asymptomatic, I immediately called my Gastro and tried to get in for an infusion and was told I’d be put on a waitlist. 

Long story short, it’s like I missed an infusion completely, I go every 6 weeks but now it’s 12 weeks between my two infusions, I got blood in my stool, can’t stay away from the bathroom, cramps, and had to take off work since I’m a truck driver and really can’t always be near a bathroom. Added bonus, when I called my gastro last week and asked her for prednisone she was asking about my symptoms like she hasn’t been seeing me as a patient for three years and knows I only ask for prednisone when it’s needed. Sorry but I just needed to rant this is an incredibly frustrating situation. 

Stay safe y’all. 

TL:DR keep yourself safe from covid as well as the usual triggers because it can cause unforeseen circumstances in the future and possibly delay your treatments.

Back then we didn’t know what the hell it was. My mum didn’t work as she looked after 4 children (me being the youngest (and my dad passed away when I was 3 months old, that’s not the point here)) and so back then we ate mostly freezer meals etc whatever my mum could feed us (I’m from the UK btw).

Now my teenager years where even rougher. I just never took my pills. When i would go to the hospital I would lie. Clearly they knew that but what could they do. Luckily, I’ve never had to have any type of surgery except the good old camera up my bum. 

But every day during my teenage years was hell. I think I would have an accident nearly every day if not close as I was doing my paper rounds in the morning. It was rough during high school as well trying to be allowed to go to the toilet. My teaches “knew” but either didn’t care or didn’t know exactly what it was, again. 

Fast forward to early 20’s and at this point I do start taken meds. Then I meet my future wife and she starts making me take them, I’ve got a decent job at this point so I’m eating way better (not perfect, still eating tons of crap food and drinking energy drinks etc) and yeah, things are better. 

Fast forward again to this point in time, I’ve now cut out almost most of my meds (doctors advice, not going against my own post lol). As I changed to a Pescatarian diet last December (I should add I only eat white fish like Cod etc and that’s rare tbf) & now since I’m eating a lot healthier and realising the importance of what this disease is, I’ve never been better. Have put on weight, I go to the toilet once a day, twice if I’m unlucky & it’s always solid. Obviously this could all change at a moments notice, but I’ve been riding this wave since Feb and I’m loving it.

I have struggled with mild left abdominal pain and mucusy stool (even when solid). I saw blood one time about a year ago, but that was forever ago, but the mucus in my stool is orange so mabye that indicates blood? I don't know. My symtoms come and go with no rhyme or reason. Sometimes I eat a piece of pepperoni and my life is hell for a week. Other times I can eat a whole pizza and be fine.


Anyway, unnecessary backstory asside, the doc recommended a colonoscopy and I have one scheduled for about 2 months out, but I'm nervous that they'll miss IBD if I'm not showing symtoms. Is there a chance they'll miss it? I know mouth ulcers heal without scarring so do U.C ulcers heal that way too? My symptoms are super unpredictable so I can't guarantee that I'll be experiencing anything before the colonoscopy.

Basically i was diagnosed with UC when i was ~8. I started off with Mesalamine, Canasa, etc, (i cant remember all of them but they were just anti-inflammatories). None of them helped. In 4th grade i started taking prednisone and by middle school i was taking mercaptopurine. The 6 mp (mercaptopurine) put me into remission for about 3-5 years, only small little flare ups in between but overall very manageable and healthy. I got a colonoscopy sometime around age 13/14 that showed that the inflammation had been significantly reduced since the last colonoscopy i got when i was 8/9. Fast forward to junior year of high school and i get a pretty heinous case of mono. During the mono i got some blood work done that showed that my liver enzymes were ridiculously high- like to the level that they thought that i might develop some super rare liver cancer (thank god i did not). But since then ive been off of 6mp. Weirdly enough from junior year of high school up until now (junior in college) ive been in remission. We came up woth some theories about how maybe the mono shot my immune system so much that it just wasnt affecting my bowels anymore. Anyways for the last month and a half or so ive had a terrible flare up- bms like 6-12 times a day always with blood and mucus. I got started on suppositories and switched to enemas but both only seemed to work for a day or two. No relief. Im going in for a colonoscopy on tuesday. Granted none of the canasa/mesalamines have ever worked for me and the rectal steroids havent done anything either, is my next best best biologics?

Last week, I finally got an appointment with a GI and after doing a sigmoidoscopy, my GI concluded that I had UC. Since then, he has put me on 2g of Pentasa pills a day for a month and Pentasa Enema for 2 weeks. He told me it isn't that bad and that I should be 100% within the month. I just have a couple of questions being new to the scene.

1. Is UC considered lifelong or has there been times were people can fully heal?
2. How long does it normally take for remission to start after being on meds?
3. Since the stomach issues, I've lost majority of my hair. There is no family balding on any sides of my parents, so if I do get better, or go through remission, will my hair grow back?
4. What are some common foods to avoid during this time?
5. I've been taking Culterelle probiotics for the last 2 years; knowing what I have now, is it useless to continue taking them or is there a better alternative?
6. My brother girlfriend got diagnosed with UC about 2 months ago and since then her GI has been infusing her with steroids and she has been ""perfect"" ever since, is that an option that is good for the long run?

That's pretty much all I got right now. Thanks guys!",2020-10-06 21:14:10

Continued getting worse, started on 60mg of Prednisone.  Of course that did not help.  Ended up in the ER for four days.  Finally started to feel a bit better so I went home.  That lasted a couple days, had an appointment with my GI.  He sent me back to the hospital and said we would have to have a conversation about surgery.  So I said you know what, I'm miserable, just cut this thing out of me.  But he wanted to wait 4 days to see if I would improve enough to try medication again.  With we wouldn't have tried that.   So ""we"" finally got to the point where we decided on surgery, but he didn't want to nice hospital with private rooms close to my house to do it.  So I had to wait a couple more days to get transferred to the hospital he wanted it done at, Cleveland Clinic, supposed to be one of the best in the US for colorectal surgery.  Within minutes of arriving I was regretting my choice, once I was wheeled into a room with a roommate.  I ended up getting surgery after a day and a half.  A spot opened up so they said let's do it.  Turns out I no longer had the option of doing surgery, because earlier that day I developed a perforated colon, so waiting was not an option. They made surgery sound so great.  I would immediately be out of pain once the surgery was done. I was told I would probably be released 2 days after the surgery.  The surgery was 8 days ago.  Every day they tell me I'll probably be ready to be released the next day.  I wish they wouldn't get my hopes up.  This morning they said I wasn't ready, but I might be ready this afternoon.  I'm still in horrible pain, I have to beg for painkiller's, and when I do get some it barely enough to even make things tolerable.  I would assume they would want me to be comfortable, but I guess not.  Even when I am due for pain medicine it takes 1-2 hours to even get a nurse into the room.  Everything about this hospital has been a disappointment.  I don't know what I'm trying to say here others then just vent some of my frustrations out.  I even asked about transferring back to the hospital I was at before, and they said because of how close I was to release they probably wouldn't take me.  How does anyone know how close I am to release?  I'm so sleep deprived from all the constant interruptions I can barely keep my eyes open, but I know if I try to sleep someone is going to come in and poke me needing to take my vitals or something.

497,Prednisone Withdrawal,johniflek,9,j81ltm,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/j81ltm/prednisone_withdrawal/,7,"Diagnosed 3 years ago. Hospitalized twice. Finally appear to be on track towards remission. Latest ""deep dive"" results indicated inflammation is isolated to lower colon/rectum. Trick on drugs is entyvio every 4 weeks, adding of imuran, and REMOVAL of apriso (mesalamine-type drug) from regimen. I had been on a mesalamine type drug since the very beginning of my diagnosis. Read on here someone who stated that it actually caused their flare after being put on it. So I stopped taking it and my never-ending flare finally started going away.

During the past couple of years, I've been consistently on prednisone, mostly at 40mg and then attempt to taper down after 2 weeks by 10mg. Flare returns and put back up. Rinse and repeat.

Now that everything is actually going well for the most part, we have been trying to taper fully off of prednisone. The first attempt was a decrease by 10mg every 10 days. When I went under 20mg, I experienced pretty heavy withdrawal symptoms - weakness in legs, daily pressure headaches, extreme fatigue.

So went back up to 30mg and once hit 20mg, decrease by 5mg every 10 days until 10mg and then by 2.5mg every 10 days. I just got to 7.5mg and withdrawal symptoms, specifically a massive daily headache have kicked in. I've been trying to power through and just hit 5mg but the headaches are pretty severe at this point and impacting my ability to work daily and just be a ~~productive~~, scratch that, just be a human being in general. Fatigue is also pretty heavy where I feel like a need at least a 2 hour nap just to be able to function until 8:30 before I head to bed.

Has anyone else experienced this when trying to get off prednisone? Any suggestions on how to combat or to kick in gear natural cortisol production? That appears to be the issue - adrenal glands reduce cortisol production due to steroids and balance needs to be restored. Is that right?

Look forward to your feedback. This group has been a lifeline over the past few years, even if I'm mostly a lurker.  Thanks!",2020-10-09 17:58:49

I was diagnosed with UC about 2 yrs ago. Of course the GI's wanted to prescribe an anti-TnF inhibitor (Remicade, Inflectra, Entyvio) first line but for many reasons, I refused those terrifying treatments. Instead, I stopped eating gluten and after a month of pooping 15-20 times a day, losing 15+ lbs and 2/3 of my hair, experiencing intense abdominal pain, not being able to be away from a bathroom, being on Prednisone 40mg (to stop the out of control inflammation spiral), and eating a GF diet, my symptoms went away.

I recently tried to re-introduce gluten which proved to be a very, very bad idea. Aside from losing my hair, I experienced all of the miserable symptoms as the first flare up. Again, a GI diagnosed me with UC. I asked her how omitting gluten effected UC, as I was able to cure myself by cutting out gluten the first time. She stated they view the two as unrelated. Of course I know differently, that gluten is DIRECTLY related to my GI troubles. So now I am on Budesonide 9mg and it's been about a week since I ensured gluten is not doing in my mouth and I am finally seeing an improvement. It's been two months since I have been pooping out my intestinal lining 15-20 times a day. My question is, who else has been given the line that they have UC and who else has experience bloody debris in their stool? I have searched this online and I find nothing. 

I highly recommend reading Chris Kresser's "" The Paleo Cure"" and Allesio Fasano's, ""Gluten Freedom"" before subjecting themselves to a horrific, expensive, invasive Tnf inhibitor. Conventional hcp's are not equipped to help you.",2020-10-10 22:14:45

I was diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis about 2 years ago. Since then, my gastroenterologist has had me on mesalamine tablets to keep the inflammation down and to keep it from turning into full blown ulcerative colitis.

I usually just wait to request a refill until I have about a week's supply of pills left because it has never taken the pharmacy any longer than about 3 days to refill the prescription. Well i ran out of pills yesterday and needless to say I am very concerned about what being off of my medication for 20 days could do to my health.

Mine gets to the point where I sometimes feel like I need to lay down because a wave of ""oh holy \*\*\*\* damnit!"" is just washing over me and draining me. It has a very ""sparky"" and shaky sensation and caffeine makes it worse. 

Right now I have to finish 2 assignments for 2 different college courses due tonight and my ADHD is already making it difficult to focus on the readings that I need to complete to do the assignments (yes I did start on them as soon as I could, yes I do already use a lot of coping methods and have a therapist), but the fatigue from UC is killing my ability to finish. Everything feels like slush. 

Has anyone used anything to help them with fatigue when they really need a boost? Or even some kind of supplement that they use long term? I'll try anything except caffeine and meditation because those things are awful for me, have tried multiple times.

Does anyone have luck with things like CBD, MSM, turmeric? I've heard some things from friends about anti-inflammatory stuff and since ""-itis"" (inflammation of) is literally in the name, maybe it \*could\* help?

—Diet has 100% allowed me to stay off medication (no gluten, no dairy, no sugar (except fruit), no processed food, low fiber (everything cooked including fruit/vegetables), no beans, only meat I eat (fish, chicken, lamb, turkey), low sulfur foods, no nuts (except almond butter), seasonings with multiple ingredients are not good due to preservatives, and try to limit alcohol as much as possible both frequency and quantity (when I do drink it’s white claw, truly, etc. Very hard to cut alcohol completely out because all my friends drink)
—Stress maintenance is important
—Sleep quality is important
—Sports are good (Golf has helped a lot with mental health, gives me something active to strive for)
—Complacency is very very bad for mental health, something we all most likely struggle with depending on frequency/severity of flare ups
—Work stress hard to conquer and manage

Been lurking on here for a while but finally decided to post. I was initially diagnosed with Proctitis in 2018 and then in March this year after another camera up the back side this was changed to a UC diagnosis.

Initially I was on one clipper steroid, 6 x 800mg octasa tablets and salofak enema 2g everyday, I hate doing the enema and having to lay on my side 30mins every night makes me feel horrible.

These controlled my flare up I had at the time for around three months, since then I’ve been having flare ups most days. My doctor wanted to get me off the clipper steroids and onto Azathiprine.

I started this a while back and my god it’s the most ill I’ve ever been, I was really sick even when taking strong anti sickness pills. I came off them after two weeks and for about 4-5 days I felt like I had a massive comedown off them, really sick again and my whole system felt really off.

I was then put on Mercaptopurine which I’ve now stopped taking today after speaking to one of the IBD nurses. I feel so fatigued and sick while on them and feel like I’ve given both drugs a good try. I’m just really struggling to have a normal life atm taking these two drugs.

I’ve now been told by the nurse they are either going to give me a tablet I can take once a week or either have an injection at home, she told me the name of these drugs but I can’t remember them sorry.

Has anyone else tried Azathiprine or Mercaptopurine? I’ve tried to find some stuff online but a lot of people don’t seem to suffer with the side effects.

Sorry for the long post just wanted to share how I’m feeling at the moment with other people that suffer from this awful disease and my heart goes out to you all x",2020-10-12 21:39:29

So this is a bit of an update to my previous post. I attached the initial assessment of me. I went to the ER for kidney stones. My hemoglobin was 11, but lol my bleeding wasn’t out of control, what a joke about the blood transfusion. Then I attached the op report, which confirms no perforation or emergency. The doctor who did my colectomy either resigned or got fired since he no longer works at the hospital where he ruined my life. Also they didn’t do a pathology report on my colon, they just threw it in the trash. Another thing, totally false about being admitted for a lower GI bleed. It’s so fucking frustrating when the people who ruined your life don‘t even know the reason I drove myself to the hospital. The bleeding was normal for me, the clots were normal, I didn’t fucking go for UC. I went for the temp and blood in urine. I have a lot of ammunition for my lawsuit with the 3000+ pages of medical records from the hospital that threw me into the fight of my life, nearly killed me, and made me disabled for life. They ripped away my job, school, body, my dreams. I loved my life so much in Jan, yes even with UC. I never visited this forum before when I had UC. I just personally never felt like a victim. I felt really good most of the time. Yes, I had rectal bleeding and urgency and high frequency, but other than that I could forget I even had it. So please stop saying he saved my life, I have all the evidence in the world I was not in a life-threatening state when I went to the ER. 

So on the day of the emergency colectomy on Feb 8 there was no perforation. CT scan only showed sigmoid wall thickening consistent with UC inflammation. They knew I didn’t have toxic megacolon or a perforation. My vitals were normal. I was perfectly stable. My temp was 98 before the surgery. I wasn’t in pain. No peritonitis. No sepsis. Nothing. I was in the same state/condition I’d been in for years. I didn’t even need to be in the hospital but they had me on fluids, IV steroids and antibiotics anyway. The op report said there were no signs of perforation. So yeah, the doctor who did the emergency surgery 100% did NOT save my life, he ruined my life. Worst of all, he needlessly took away my chance with Stalera. So they did an emergency surgery on a Saturday when they knew it wasn’t an emergency. They did a stat surgical consultation on a Saturday. I asked to wait a couple days and was told, “you might not have a couple days.“ I didn’t seem to make the case strong enough on my previous post that this was truly an act of evil. I could have told the colorectal surgeon to fuck off and I could have just gone home and been fine and continued living my amazing life. All evidence points to that being an option. Then I could have tried Stalera.

What’s so infuriating is I never heard of this hospital before that day. I never heard of the GI doc or the colorectal surgeon. I had no report with any of them. I ALREADY had a GI doc and he was gonna put me on Stalera. I was so excited for Stalera. I didn’t go to the ER the night before for rectal bleeding. I went for suspected kidney stones cuz I had blood in urine. 

I spend every waking second wanting to try Stalera, but evil really did take that opportunity from me. Stalera. Stalera. Stalera. What if it worked. I tell myself the chances were low. Then I see Stalera success stories and it makes me devastated because that means the chances of it having worked for me are higher. I hate him with every fiber of my being. I scream and yell and cry all day at how much I hate him. I hope he loses his everything. My life was going so good. One drive to the ER late Fri night would put in the hospital for months. That man bullied me the next day. They went off my history as enough of a reason to rush me into surgery. Like they don’t fucking know I’m aware I have UC. If I wanted a colectomy, I would have gotten one. It’s like if you have severe UC and YOUR doctor who you have known for awhile plans to put you on a new drug, then you go on vacation far away, sprain your ankle, you go to the nearest random ER, they routinely ask for health history and once they hear about your UC history, they bring in a GI doc and colorectal surgeon and push you for emergency surgery. It’s like, “Uhh who the fuck are you people? I’m aware I have UC. That’s already being taken care of with MY DOCTOR. Options are being discussed with him already.” Like I had UC for over 8 years, this random fucking hospital in the middle of nowhere backwoods of redneck Florida that I was transferred to literally had me in the operating room not even 24 hours after I arrived when there was zero evidence of any emergency. They turned my life completely upside down. The day before surgery I had not a clue in the world about the nightmare that was coming. And all the evidence shows there was NO emergency that day. The doctor truly is a monster. He ruined my life when he didn’t have to. We all deserve a chance at our Hail Marry. Stalera was my Hail Marry. The mental torment at being a week or two from potentially my miracle drug, and this fuck comes into my life out of complete nowhere and does an unnecessary surgery. It’s raw unadulterated vengeance time. It’s fucking all-out war with Trinity Medical Center. The unfiltered rage and hatred I feel towards that man, I’m devoting my life to bringing him and that entire hospital down to the fucking ground and beyond. Iv’e never felt so much hatred towards a human being or a set of human beings. They didn’t know me. They didn’t know that I had a GI doc and my UC was being taken care of. That’s not their fucking role. What he did was such perfect timing. To fuck my entire life WHEN I WAS WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF TRYING STALERA. TO ROB ME OF CHOICE. The hatred towards what that man did over 8 months ago hasn’t died down one bit. Iv’e been on multiple 51/50s this year. Iv’e had weekly violent outbursts destroying my parents house all summer, Iv’e swerved my car around recklessly going 80 down my street knocking over trash cans. I’m currently on the run for throwing output from my loop ostomy at people at Target. My bail is $150,000. 

While I plan to destroy so many lives like that of the GI doc and colorectal surgeon from Trinity Medical Center, it won’t stop the Stalera obsession, the frustration, the crippling curiosity at how it would have helped me if at all will keep me in mental agony for the rest of my life. To think that drug would have bought me a few years of remission. To think I was right there and I could have seen for myself, and these fucks came out of complete nowhere to make sure I‘ll never fucking know if Stalera would have worked for me. And I can’t go back. I can’t reverse their acts of evil. Honestly if Stalera failed, I’d just wait until I actually needed emergency surgery. That may not have been for another 4 years.",2020-10-14 10:14:41

So I was diagnosed with UC about 6-7 years ago. I used to take Mesalamine pretty consistently until the past 6 months. for whatever reason, because I didn’t experience any symptoms, I became pretty irresponsible and I haven’t been taking since March. I’m not too proud of it. But I haven’t experienced any noticeable symptoms other than fecal urgency.

I’ve been lurking (learning) from this sub for a short while, commenting, but this is my first post. So grateful knowing that we’re not alone in our experience, however different each one may be. 

Late 2019 I was diagnosed with UC, though I have my suspicions that it started at the very least a year or two prior. Since my diagnosis I haven’t done much in terms of limiting my diet or taking medication. Basically I would just suffer through. However, I believe that due my ignorance my depression has been greatly impacted, and perhaps other autoimmune issues have gone undiagnosed. 

Currently I’m transferring care from my former medical coverage to the VA, where I hope to connect it to my time in service. This week I learned of many more Veterans diagnosed with issues similar to mine. It’s believed that the many vaccinations we received (anthrax, small pox, etc.) are the cause. Has anyone here been in the military prior to receiving a diagnosis? If so, have you been able to connect the diagnosis to your disability rating?

Also, I believe I am mid flare with all over joint/body pain, stomach aching/gurgling, soft & frequent BMS, in addition to light headedness, rapid heartbeat and cold sweats after little activity. I’ve cut out dairy, added sugars, most breads, fried and processed foods. Until last week I was feeling satisfactory (about 75-80%), walking every day and doing yoga. Now I feel winded going up a flight of stairs, severe brain fog, and weak after a hot shower. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? From what I’ve read here the cold sweat and lightheadedness aren’t common, which makes me think there might be an additional diagnosis. Does anyone have a dual diagnosis with something’s such as POTS or fibromyalgia?

Thank you everyone for your overall insight. This group really is a form of support that many of us wouldn’t have otherwise.

I read this forum sometimes and am always comforted by the fact that I'm not alone in this often daily fight.

Some background - I (22F) was diagnosed in July 2018 and got that flare under control with mesalamine. Had no symptoms up until November 2019. At that point, I was on the highest dose of mesalamine so it was time to try biologics. I went on to fail a clinical trial (upadicitinib - may have been given the placebo though), Remicade and Entyvio. I have been on various doses of prednisone since March. I am currently trying Stelara and have had three doses with what seems to be no change in symptoms. I had a colonoscopy at the end of September that showed severe inflammation and ulcers in only the first 20 cm of my colon (inflammation was worse than previously in January but it used to be 50 cm up the colon). After that colonoscopy, I spent my first night in the hospital getting a dose of Stelara and IV steroids.

Since Stelara is not working, my GI has brought up trying Xeljanz. I am very hesitant about this as my husband and I would ideally like to start trying to have children as soon as I've fully recovered from this flare (plus a few months) and I've been told Xeljanz is not safe for pregnancy. My GI seems hesitant to go to surgery since the inflammation is only in the first 20 cm. I have become a lot more open to the idea of surgery as my quality of life right now is really sad. I need to be home for at least the first two hours after waking up because I'm in the bathroom, waking up 2+ times a night, 7-10 BMs/day with lots of urgency and some blood. 

Has anyone been in a similar position where you are on Xeljanz and have or are wanting to get pregnant? My concern is coming off of it, flaring again and being in the same position I currently am in. Is it better to just get my colon removed now considering all the drugs I've already failed? I'm really open to some advice here. Thank you in advance!",2020-10-15 02:45:14

5 weeks ago I woke up in the middle of the night with a cramp along my lower abdomen. I went to the restroom and boom diarrhea. Over the next couple of weeks, It was basically diarrhea, I didn't go multiple times a day, just once or twice a day. However a couple of times I went, it was thin stools. About two weeks ago I started getting this burning pain in my lower abdomen and I started burping a lot, kind of like heartburn with the occasional stabbing pain in the stomach.

This made me finally visit a doctor. He checked my stomach and prescribed me Ciprofloxacin for a week. I did it for 6 days straight. The burning sensation in my lower abdomen went away and after a few days I was able to go to the bathroom regularly. I felt really well when I would wake up, but as soon as I ate something I would start burping and feel indigestion and sometimes a stabbing pain in my upper left abdomen. The 7th day I decided to stop the Ciprofloxacin because it was making me drowsy, I had no pain until that night. I ended up at the ER and they gave me a GI cocktail and chalked it up to stress. I went back home and the pain started again and the diarrhea. I took one of the Ciprofloxacin pills I had left and that calmed it down.

I went to see the doctor again last week and described everything that had happened that week. He told me to finish the Ciprofloxacin but he was going to give me omeprazole for the indigestion and gas, and to stop the use of Ciprofloxacin. And I had to provide a stool sample to test for H Pylori and I had to get an abdominal ultrasound (I did it last Thursday, came back with no issues).

Over the weekend I have had GERD symptoms and last night while asleep I had this excruciating stabbing pain in my lower left abdomen, it felt like 5 stabs and then it stopped. Yesterday and this morning went to the restroom, I took a lansoprazole the Dr. prescribed to stop the diarrhea. No diarrhea but I when I wiped I saw drops of blood. I don't know if I have hemorrhoids (I did strain myslef to provide the stool sample) or if it is just another symptom.

I've never been more scared in my life, I feel that the doctor is treating the symptoms but not going after the cause. I had to push him to find me a place where I could do the ultrasound as fast as possible, they had initially scheduled it for the 23 of October.

I've lost 7 pounds in the last 10 days. The anxiety is killing me, it could be many things but its like I'm getting all the symptoms. And I'm scared to death. I think I'm just going to a GI to get a colonoscopy, before the stress starts causing even more havoc on my body.",2020-10-15 01:44:39

2. Do I take both Prednisone and Pentasa together with a meal and if I do, does it matter in what order I take them?
3. What are some common side effects that I should expect while on Prednisone?
4. If I get some of the side effects, do they go away once I am off the medication?
5. Should I continue taking Pentasa even after I am done with Prednisone?
6. I have been having massive headaches and my entire body is sore, does Pentasa do that for everyone?
7. Should I increase my water intake while on these? I already drink quite a bit but would it be better?
8. What is the best time to take these? Morning or afternoon?
9. Are there other medication I should take while taking these, I normally take a multivitamin, a calcium, magnesium, zinc pill, a turmeric pill, and omega 3. Is it okay to keep taking these?
10. Any one have been on remission from Prednisone? Just want some reassurance here.

Those are all the questions I got right now, thanks!",2020-10-17 23:14:02
617,Some good news I guess?,Cyynric,9,jd2weu,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/jd2weu/some_good_news_i_guess/,4,"I've been having acute pain in my rectum and anal area since about April now. Last month I finally had a colonoscopy, which happily revealed that I'm in remission for my UC. The gastro said that the pain was likely from internal hemorrhoids, and referred me to a colorectal surgeon for further evaluation.

Somewhat luckily, it turns out that the hemorrhoids are very minor, and do not need surgery. The pain I'm feeling is apparently an anal fissure, deep enough that it hasn't naturally healed for all these months. Using astringents that help hemorrhoids hasn't helped either, since they restrict blood flow, slowing the healing process. So now I'm using a nifedipine ointment that should fix the issue.

TL;DR: Supposed hemorrhoid pain is an anal fissure, and hemorrhoid treatments have been prolonging it.",2020-10-17 22:50:18

I was doing good all year no issues up until about early September. I had a sigmoidoscopy at end of August where my GI notes I still had mild inflammation in the first 15 cm of my colon but the rest was looking great. I’ve been on lialda, enemas and Imuran for about 2 years consistently. My lab work for Imuran was all over the place with low levels so my GI said to stop taking and recommended switching to Remicade/Inflectra instead for more long term success. I was flaring again within a few days of stopping the Imuran. I started my loading doses of Inflectra on 9/28 and had second on 10/12. I also got out back on prednisone 40mg per day starting 9/26. It’s been a few weeks and I’m seeing some improvements but not as much as I had hoped. 

What have others experienced switching to biologic? 

I still have bright red blood each day but seems to lessen as I go and I’m only going to the bathroom 3-5 time per days. Also starting to get formed brown stool but then blood when I wipe so I know it’s coming from the rectum area. Just wondering when I may see better results. My final loading dose infusion is 11/9.

My apologies for the lengthy post, questions are located at the bottom. Btw I'm 23 Male, regular weight (trying to get fit) Thanks! 

**UPDATE**

+ Doctor says some of my rectum is inflammated, and the beginning of the colon is starting to get inflammated

+ Doctor said ""it may be an Irritable Bowel Disease such as UC"" he went from probably to maybe

+ Also said I should be ""able to live a normal and healthy lifestyle with medication

+ Wants me to take mesalamine by mouth in addition to suppository

+ Wants me to get another colonoscopy within 6-9 months to see if medication is working

I thought the biopsies would provide a final diagnosis. Note the ""it may be an IBD"" would suggest it might not even be UC nor any IBD? I am more confused than before. Is it a good sign that he says I should be able to live a normal life with meds? Is this good or bad?

**TL;DR I had gastrointestinal symptoms that have so far improved, I got a colonoscopy done due to minimal blood and other symptoms (and health anxiety). GI doctor (very calmly) says I ""probably"" have UC, and does not seem in a rush for an early appointment, says ""you can eat anything you want.""**

**When Symptoms Started:**
Near the end of August, I suddenly went from having regular stools/bowel movements to sudden diarrhea. The diarrhea lasted for 3 days without blood, although on the fourth day and onward, the stool had mucous and and blood and was a mixture of semi-solid/broken stools and watery diarrhea for weeks. I had an urgency to use the restroom around 3-7 times a day. The blood was only on the tip of the stool, and sometimes came out as a red line (I assumed it was a hemorrhoid). I had absolutely no pain.

**Setting Up an Appointment for Colonoscopy:**
Anyways, thanks to health anxiety, the first time I saw blood in my stool (4th day of diarrhea), I went to urgent care immediately (the blood was very minimal). I was able to get the doctor to reference me to a GI, and let's just say the anxiety helped me convince the person setting up the appointment, to squeeze me into an earlier slot with the ""best GI available."" The appointment was approx. mid September, GI said it sounded like I had hemorrhoids and prescriped some hemorrhoid suppositories, but to be on the safe side, he wanted to conduct a colonoscopy either way. By this time, my stool was starting to grow in size, and was very solid (It looked like regular stool with miniscule amounts of blood). Although it came out green various times, I think this was due to me eating a large amount of blueberries on a daily basis (I can't help it)

**Colonoscopy:**
A few days ago (October) I finally got a colonoscopy. The doctor said there was some inflammation in the rectal and colon area. Although, since I was under the effect of anesthesia, I did not hear whether he mentioned the part of the intestine that connects to the colon. He seemed very calm, and just said ""it's probably ulcerative colitis."" I asked ""probably?"" and he repeated ""Yes, probably"" and walked away. They also took 5 biopsies, no polyps, no hemorrhoids, just inflammation. I asked the doctor if I had food restrictions, he said I can eat anything.

This is where I am very confused. The doctor was very calm when he told me that, I know this is redundant, but what confuses me is that he included the word ""probably."" I have an appointment scheduled for mid November, I got prescribed mesalamine suppositories. I understand that doctors are very busy, although I would assume it's a good sign that there isn't a rush for the next appointment.

**Questions**

+ This may be wishful thinking, but are there any other illnesses that are similar to UC? 


+ Since my symptoms have calmed down since September, and my stools are now a normal size with difficult to notice blood, I have 3 or less daily bowel movements, no pain, along with the inflammated colon and rectum, what would be the severity of the UC? 


+ Is it normal for a GI doctor to tell a patient with potential UC that they can eat anything? 


+ Are mesalamine suppositories usually given for the lowest-severity of UC, or other gastrointestinal illnesses?


**Note** I know I won't know for sure what I have until I speak to the doctor next month, and I acknowledge my impatience. Although, I like to know what I have to immediately start tackling the problem, even if it can be a life-long thing. I already made modifications to a low-fiber diet, taking prebiotics and probiotics (food and supplements), and continuing my exercise regimen (I paused exercise when I had urgency to use the restroom for 3 - 4 weeks)",2020-10-17 13:05:24

I dont have UC/CD/IBD/etc (not diagnosed)

Background: very little physical activity, but no change in diet for the last few months. I eat regular home cooked food.

Issue:

Although  there has been no change in my lifestyle or diet for the past 6 months,  I've had a stingy, burning sensation in the anal area while passing  stool for the last 4 days, with varying intensity on each day. The  burning sensation persists for a few minutes after passing the stool as  well.  
I've also noticed blood in my stool for the last 4 days. It's  bright red. I would characterize the sting/burn as a multiple point  sting. Almost feels like multiple points of the anus are on fire.

I've  tried incorporating more fluids into my diet, started drinking more  water and incorporated more vegetables into my eating routine for the  last 2 days now.

What could be the  cause of sudden onset of such situation? I've done some googling now,  but the answers vary from IBD, Crohns, UC, hemorrhoids, and so forth.

Took NSAID for a week (Which gave me the same symptons I'm having now) and went to the ER which diagnosed me with Bacterial infection (??). After taking some antibiotics I got better but had a bunch of tachycardia and got a unberable back pain that wouldn't let me walk or sit. I was diagnosed with cervical hernia which made me bedrriden for 1 month and half and when I got better I started to have a lot of diarreah (15x times a day) with mild pain, caused by incomplete bowel movement. 

Currently:

- I did blood tests, stool tests, stool culture and fecal occult blood and everything came back clean except that sunddenly I was lactose intolerant.
- My colonoscopy showed I had a mild longitudinal enanthem throughout my left side of my colon without exudate. That was the only abnormal thing there. The doctor who performed the colonoscopy was in a such bad mood and told without even looking to me that it's probably Ulcerative Colitis. But I heard that the Prep, NSAID and even IBS could cause this. So I'm hoping he's wrong. (I still have to wait for the biopsy)
- The endoscopy I did today unfortunately came clean as I was hoping to be diagnosed with some gastritis or ulcer. Even my doctor had prescriped me some PPI to me before, thinking that I had gastritis.
- My nausea episode only appeared 3 months ago, when I took the NSAID and once a week afterwards. (but it was really mild). But then, 2 weeks ago, I had some psyllium husk and this nausea started to become chronic. (It was one of the worst episode...I only got relief after evacuating a lot of mucus - like 2 white balls of mucus - )

Honestly I feel lost and extremely anxious/sad because I still have to wait for 2 weeks for the results of my biopsy  and I'm dealing with fear and constant nausea in a way that I can't concentrate or do anything on my day. I can't enjoy a conversation, I can't work or do chores, I can't play or watch something without losing focus because of the discomfort. I'm afraid it could be cancer or Crohn's along with UC (since I feel like my nausea and fullness comes from some bowel obstruction)

I feel so alone because nobody seems to be taking serious how crippling is my problem and 2 doctors already told me my nausea is all from my head. :(

Does anyone have some clue on what's happening to me or had some similar symptons like mine? I honestly would love if it was some sort of IBS, because at least I'd feel some hope to find a cure....

Edit: After a month, I don't have diarrhea anymore, only loose stool. 1-2 per day. Maybe because I cut gluten, lactose, followed FODMAP and etc... my main concern is the intense nausea.",2020-10-18 09:37:23

I also got diagnosed with UC four yrs ago. The GI  recommended Entyvio, but as someone who has always been super healthy and active, taking an anti-TNF inhibitor freaked the crap out of me, esp when told about the side effects and that it was a lifelong treatment that involved needles. Ick. I also see/saw the anti TNF inhibitors as a band-aid and not a cure. I also have a hard time with GI's who tell me food does not matter. Have they ever heard of a gut microbiome??

 I omitted gluten and my problems went away. My calprotectin results were totally normal, indicating no inflammation. Then, beginning this year, I stupidly thought I would re-challenge myself with gluten. I also, unknowingly, consumed some gluten. The culmination was not good. Fast forward to August 4th and blood started showing up again in my stool. Big time. Now I am month 3 into my second flare. It's terrible. I have lost a ton of blood, weight, have no energy and am on my 4th GI. 

I tested negative for CD. It's unclear whether I am gluten sensitive (there is a spectrum) or I actually just have UC and the flare would have happened regardless of what I ate. Insurance willing, I hope to fly to the Mayo Clinic to have a work up by the best. If they say I need to go on an anti-TNF inhibitor than I suppose I will have to wave the white flag and get on the medication treadmill. Getting a colostomy bag is more scary than taking anti-TNF inhibitors. Hopefully there will be a cure in 5-10 years and we can all wake from this nightmare. Go figure...I am the healthiest person in my family and I am the one to get an f-ing chronic autoimmune disease.

Has anyone cured UC by omitting gluten? Or has it helped get out of a flare at least?",2020-10-19 05:18:06

When you look up side effects of Inflectra upper respiratory infection is the top result. I’m about to call my doctors office to leave him a message about it but I’m scared he’s gonna want to stop Inflectra because of this even though it’s helping my UC (I think). I have the cough and phlegm but no fever. I didn’t react to my first infusion but my second infusion was almost two weeks ago and I seemed I get a sore throat right after that and it turned into this. Words of advice please.,2020-10-20 18:04:22

I had a colonoscopy on the 13th of October. I'm glad to anounce the dry mouth symptom finally went away. Although now I have another issue (yay!). After about 4-5 days of waking up to a dry mouth, that went away but I started to notice my abdominal area feels warm/hot, especially when I sleep. As a consequence, I haven't had a good night rest. **I also have anxiety.** Here is what I experience: 

+ No pain 

+ Hot flashes around body, primarily abdominal area 

+ What feels like adrenaline releasing

+ Slight tenderness in the abdominal area beneath the rib cage

+ Comes and go

+ Broken sleep 

**Explanation of symptoms**
I found placing ice helps me fall asleep, if I don't, I focus on the warmth and get what feels like adrenaline. I wanted to note that I got 5 biopsies done, from what I read it is normal to experience tenderness, especially from gas (which I randomly pass). I thought I may have a fever, but the most my temp gets to is 99F at night, which is normal but toward the upper range (it's normal to experience this due to anxiety). I had a ""hot flash"" a while ago before posting this, and I assumed my temperature would be at 99F, it was at 97.9 (I had just woken up), I felt it on my forehead and abdominal area followed by adrenaline. Hence, why I believe much of this is anxiety related.

I noticed when I talk to people, or focus on videos, I don't experience the hot flash nor warmth. The second I give it thought, even if I am distracted I get that feeling of adrenaline instantly. 

I can't 100% tell if the adrenaline is from me focusing on the warmth, or if the adrenaline causing me to focus on it. 

**Mental State (may contribute or be causing this)**
Ever since the doctor said I might have an IBD such as Ulcerative Colitis, I have been worrying. During the dry mouth spell, I dreaded going to bed because of it, and thought it would never go away. I've also been worrying about feeling warm when I doze off, which stimulates the abdominal area to be warm. 

**NOTE: The doctor said I only have some inflammation in the rectum and its beginning in the colon. He seems more unsure of what I have after looking at the biopsies. The tenderness and adrenaline/warmth are felt on the mid to upper areas of the abdominal area, not the area near the bottom where I have inflammation**",2020-10-21 22:49:35

Last night, they hit me with my first infusion of Remicade (influximab), and overnight like some kind of magic fairy potion, I just slowly stop going to the bathroom to the point that I've only gone about 3 times in the last 8 hours.  I knew this stuff was good, but I had no expectation that it would actually work this quick.  I'm astounded, in shock and still waiting for some kind of rebound to hit.

I was 20 minutes from home, and only 5 minutes from the store I was heading to - and I knew they had a public bathroom I could use.

I just had to make it there. 

I managed to find a parking space, and by that point the situation is not good. I shuffle awkwardly up to the pay parking machine, shove my credit card in, pay, then painstakingly make my way to the store, clenching furiously while trying to look at least somewhat normal as I do so.

I was nearly to the bathroom when the urgency intensified. 

The last few steps to the bathroom were a sprint.

I get in the stall, and as I pull my pants down, trying desperately to hold it in for a few seconds longer, I lose control and end up shitting all over the toliet seat. Not realising I had just missed the toliet bowl with that first uncontrolled deluge, I then sat in it.

... what a mess.

I'm 23 year old female I was diagnosed with U.C in July. I was prescribed mesalazine suppositories and salofalk sachet to be taken once a day. I took this and the blood and mucus pretty much stopped all together..  then I was told by my friend to be careful of IBD medication as they are immunosuppressants and with COVID it did make me a little worried. 

I stopped taking all medication about a month ago and have had small amounts of mucus and blood since. I told my doctor this and he said I need to get on medication straight away even if the mucus and blood are in small amounts as it can lead to bigger implications........

So I'm basically wondering if it's really dangerous to live with a small flare up?  Should I be more worried about immunosuppressants than having 0 blood and mucus at all? Should I just take the meds and forget about all that crap???? Any help would be great !!

I'm Chinese, so my family tends to eat leafy vegetables and of course rice, not sure how to phrase this but what's your experience with Chinese/Asian food?

12. What is the phantom rectum feeling like? Is it a strong feeling? Do you try to go or ignore it? I get pretty bad tenesmus during flares, never found a solution other than waiting it out, hated it so much, it was worse than pain.

13. How did you deal with a flaring rectal stump? Is it less bad compared to pre-surgery because it's a shorter isolated part now?

14. Which soap do you use to clean the skin around the stoma? I know they're supposed to have extras like moisturizers etc but I don't know which brands are good.

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated as well! Thanks in advance! (I already posted this in r/ostomy but the more info the better!)",2020-10-23 22:28:33

I had been on a terrible flare since May, but finally I am almost in a full remission. Since from the beginning, I have been using mesalazine enemas and tablets at the same time. Although Enemas are perfect, I am not pretty sure that tablets have a significant effect on my condition. Therefore, I started to think passing to another brand of mesalazine tablets. Particularly, Asacol 800mg tablet  (Since Asacol Enema works perfect).  Right now, I am on Salofalk 500mg. Have you guys expericed any significant difference between mesalazine brands?

my boyfriend came back just in time to be diagnosed with stage four colon cancer with Mets to bone and peritoneum just before Christmas. We are shattered. 

He's back on prednisone and I can say with 100% confidence it caused these issues. His anger is now directed at his family and I'm the saviour. It's really hard to watch. Sometimes he is delusional and thinks they are stealing from us and selling his stuff online. He is weaning off and these delusions are going away. 

Scary. 

___

October 2020:

Hey everyone! Throwaway account because my partner is on Reddit too. 

I don't have UC (hats off to those of you who do, I think you are amazing!!!) But my (ex) partner does. 

He's been on and off prednisone now since about April of this year. He's taken it before and never had side effects like this. 

When he started at 40 mg, he seemed OK. But by May, he was pacing and his speech was rapid and pressured. 

In about June, his doctor increased the dose to 60 mg. At that point, he began talking to himself loudly, even when I was in the room, complaining about things touching him that weren't, picking fights with me, yelling at me during a normal conversation, not sleeping, kicking things, and he got moon face (which is the least of my worries obviously.)

We have been together for 5 years and we live together. 

So my partner was able to taper off at the beginning of August, but it's like the psych symptoms remained. He was still extremely irritable, touchy, sometimes didn't want to sleep beside me, etc. He did have his moments of clarity though. One night we were cooking and he said to me ""remember how crazy I was this summer? Wow."" And we laughed and I said ""it'll take a lot more than that for me to leave.""

He ended up having to go back on it earlier this month as he was still so inflamed. Back on 60 mg. I believe he will be on it until the first week of December. 

Last week he shot me a text that he wasn't coming home. He decided that he was breaking up with me because I expressed sadness that we hadn't had any physical contact in a while and reiterated that I'd love a night in watching movies in bed (and no I don't mean sex. I mean like cuddling or sleeping beside me as he now sleeps on the couch.) He said he hasn't been happy in months and he believes I am spreading malicious lies around our friend group about him (which I am not.)

He still hasn't been home to collect his things. He's staying with his parents, I believe. I haven't been responding to his messages because I am afraid of setting him off even worse. He deleted his relationship status on Facebook and posted a photo of him alone. He deleted my entire family from his list. They are all really hurt because they were close with him. He kept me and hasn't deleted any of our photos or anything. 

Guys, I just want to be super supportive of him and his healing. Do I reach out? Is that what you would want while you're in the throes of prednisone? Do I continue to give him space though he continues to message me after telling me basically to **** off? I've pretty much gone no contact. Should I chalk this up to prednisone?

I feel lost without him. We had quite a happy relationship before April of this year. Thanks, prednisone :(",2020-10-23 14:08:22

I would like to know your opinions on my situation. I was diagnosed last year and was prescribed mesalamine. Due to certain situations i was horrified to take any merication so i did not start it. So fast forward to the present here is the situation my father is fighting with cancer and my mother has severe anxiety disorder. As for me my symptoms havent really detoriated. But there  is this thought in my head that since i am not treating my uc i am allowing to let it get worse even though there are no visible symptom changes. I live in india where uc is extremly rare and so is its treatment. There is no insurance neither do we have any support. The doctors also dont give a shit about you. All i know about ibd is through the internet as my doc just gave me the medicine and that was it. Now i know that mesalamine does have some pretty bad side effects and that is the reason why i am so terrified to take it. Also did i mention that there is not a single hospital in my state. So if something does go wrong with the med i am basically done for. So this is the mess. It might seem silly but everything that can get worse is getting worse. My family also is not rich or anything and we also have to take care of the cost of chemo on our own. 
And so here i am not knowing what is the right choice to make and i quiet honestly cant see a future ahead. Should i wait for my symptoms to get worse as they have actually been getting somewhat better on their own or should i just bite the bullet and start the treatment because we cannot handle anything else on our plate right now. Sorry for rambling so much it is just that we all feel hopeless.

I drink at least 2 litres of water a day (and I'm only small) so it's not that.

I work 9-5 in an office 2 days a week and wfh the rest of the week so I dont want to up the frequency even more.

I have been suffering with UC for a while now and I always have had a dull pain/ache on the left side of my buttocks/colon. I can feel it when i press a part of my butt check about 2 inches left of my anus. I always will notice the pain when I sit on that side, or lay on that side. I’m constantly shifting my weight and how I’m sitting in the car especially. 

At first I thought it was internal hemorrhoids, and they were irritated inside me because I was maybe sitting on one(the pain also feels like a sort or pressure). But none of my doctors said anything about seeing hemorrhoids in my colon on colonoscopies. They always just see inflammation of the colon.

Very recently I started doing a retention enema and also did FMT which has pretty much wiped out my UC symptoms. No more bleeding or urgency or diarrhea! Also, no more UC meds YAY! 

The only problem is I still feel the dull ache to the left of my anus. It won’t go away even though it seems my UC is getting/has gotten better.

I’m struggling of late with my UC after several years of varying success using different meds. 
Having gone in and out of remission I know there is a bright side out there, although sadly not rn for myself. 

I would like to hear from anyone that has tried a low FODMAP diet, what did you think? did it help? how long did it take to help?
I saw an Australian dietitian who claims to have had huge success using this approach helping people only downside was his courses were very pricey. I want to know if there is any validity to the diet.

I was put on prednisone then eventually Remicade which stopped the bleeding. My hospital stay was 45 days and I developed a opioid  addiction during that time. Morphine, Hydro Morphine, Deladid,
Percocet the pain was so severe they had to increase the mg. I lost 50lbs. I  weighed  130lbs from 180lbs and began a strick diet. Long story short Remicade worked then I developed a antibody after missing a infusion. I had to move on to a new drug... Simponi. It worked as well and I was on it for 4 years and I could eat or drink anything, same as Remicade. Then I stopped!!! Both drugs gave me extreme side effects. I had pain in my hands and feet fatigue and complete body pain. After a 8 hour shift I could not walk. I'm 36 years old. The symptoms became worse over time. I know the these symptoms are linked to my disease but I feel they are amplified by the drug. I stopped taking Simponi. Two years now Infusion free. I listened to my body. I have a diet based on what my body agrees to. Yes I have numbness and pain in my lower extremities at times but it is no where near what it was before. I thought I would be back in the ER if I got off of any type of auto immune disease infusion. I thought it would be life or death. But then I had a ""fuck it"" moment and decided to be drug free. So far no problems 😊 I workout often eat healthy and smoke smoke weed from time to time for the discomforts that come with UC. The opiod addiction from the ER was kicked months after btw I forgot to mention that. Does anyone have a similar story ? Did you happen to 🖕 the infusions as well ?",2020-10-25 18:06:23

767,Biology researcher's (phd) advice & reflections on managing severe colitis,OttoVonBisbark,10,jii3sj,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/jii3sj/biology_researchers_phd_advice_reflections_on/,10,"*Personal*

During my first year of graduate school I began noticing small amounts of what unambiguously was blood on my toilet paper. Pretty dang scary at first, and then terrifying as it simply got worse with time. At this point I had no emergency bathroom runs or uncontrolled bloody diarrhea, only small consistent amounts of blood while wiping. Two weeks or so after noticing the blood I sucked it up and rang a nurse hotline. To my surprise they said it was probably nothing and I shouldn’t worry about it.

They were quite wrong, and I should absolutely have worried about it. A month later I am miserable, sprinting (or waddling) to the bathroom well over 10 times a day. I can barely even commute for fear of crapping my pants during the 20-minute trek to my lab. Since I moved cities to do my PhD, other factors were contributing to the nightmare. Money was tight, I had no friends or family, my girlfriend was in a different city, and I was in the ‘performance’ part of our program where we do stints in several labs jockeying for a spot in the prestigious ones. The stress definitely contributed to my symptoms.

I finally went to a doctor and, duh der, severe colitis. They put me on some steroids and say that’s all I can do. Forever. No cure. No reliable lifestyle changes. Just take these drugs that are worth $2,500 a month indefinitely and pray. I was incredulous, and realized I was a biologist with a degree in statistics. I’m capable of consulting the literature. F\*\*k it. It didn’t take long to find positive results in clinical trials with probiotic treatments. I asked the doctor about these and he disregarded them as hand-waivey untested new stuff. I fired him on the spot because he didn’t sympathize with my desperation\* and hunted around for a more humane doctor. After finding one, we developed a plan that involved many of the lifestyle changes I describe below. I went on a strong course of steroids until symptoms subsided, then eased up on the steroids while continuing VSL3 twice daily, completely abstaining from alcohol, 16:8 fasting, and staying low carb.

I stuck to the plan and induced a deep 5-year complete remission. Over the last several years, I have found that repeated heavy drinking induces a flare, but the combination of strategies below reins it in after threeish weeks.

\*I recommend asking about probiotics as a doctor litmus test for all UC patients. If your doctor is unwilling to engage with a comprehensive treatment plan that involves steroids coupled with lifestyle changes and probiotics, they aren’t taking you seriously. You’re living in a nightmare, and you deserve a doctor that will try to manage symptoms but also induce as deep a remission as possible using as complete a strategy as you can handle.

*UC cause and mechanisms*

It is not clear. But a plausible story is emerging that your body forgets to recognize some members of your gut microbiome as safe and begins attacking them. During the process of attacking those wrongly labelled ‘foreign’ bugs in your stomach, you generate some degree of immune recognition for your own bowel wall. While attacking both bugs in your stomach and your own bowel ulcers form / bleed and your mucosal linings break down. This environment (warm, dark, full of iron rich blood) further enables the growth of nasty bugs which in turn exacerbates the immune response in a nasty spiral. Genetic markers suggest that some immune systems are more predisposed to this confusion than others.

Flare management techniques doctors prescribe mostly center on settling the immune response by knifing out individual components of your immune system with varying degrees of specificity (steroids & biologics). Flare management techniques I have found effective involve steroids of course, but also microbiome modification and inflammation management (inflammation is your body’s nonspecific immune response).

*Controversial opinions I think UC folks should hear*

It's fashionable to say 'X treatment has been investigated, but there's still no conclusive evidence demonstrating its effect. So just sit tight and use the approved treatments.’ From a scientific perspective, this is fine. We don’t unambiguously know anything without reproducible data. From a patient perspective this is harmful. We are rushing to the toilet 20x a day to dump blood — we’re desperate and willing to take risks on lifestyle interventions that may not yet have concrete data but incur almost no risk and have a sensible mechanism underpinning them / anecdotes supporting them. If your doctor won’t work with you on lifestyle suggestions, dump them and find another.

The drugs that are approved for UC are mostly steroids or biologic immunomodulators. They’re approved not because they are the most permanent solution for symptoms, but because they are the easiest to detect a statistical signature with during clinical trials. Consider two solutions, one that quenches symptoms quickly and another that treats the disease slowly. Building a clinical trial where you lock down symptoms is fast, affordable, and reliable; but building a clinical trial to treat the disease with somewhat difficult lifestyle interventions over a year’s time is expensive and dependent on patient compliance. Even in the event a solution / cure exists, if it requires difficult lifestyle changes and long-term application there may never be clinical data to conclusively support it. Your doctor should acknowledge these limitations in the literature.

Drugs alone may help you live your life, but long-term remission absolutely will require lifestyle changes.

*Flare management lifestyle changes I think every UC patient should try*

Do not drink. This is an inflammatory / autoimmune disease and the last thing you want to do is provoke your immune system. Folks will say a drink here and there is fine, and maybe it is, but if you are serious about cutting a flare off you should avoid alcohol altogether.

Fast. Perhaps quite aggressively. A convincing body of research is emerging that suggests fasting quiets your innate immune system. Again, this is an inflammatory disease, and anything that settles your nonspecific immune freak-out is welcome. 16:8 fasting is a good entry point, though I think 48-hour fasts are even better if you can swing them.

Cut the coffee. Coffee is a stress inducing beverage, and stress is pretty consistently associated with flares.

Take probiotics & eat probiotic foods. Your microbiome is complicated and the easy availability of blood may feed otherwise latent harmful bacterial strains. When you consider that these strains can grow on / near an ulcer it is not surprising that your immune response is so violent. VSL3 & Visbiome (effectively the same thing, but some internal politics sparked a differentiation) are both ultra-high concentration probiotics containing a mix of bacteria that can help quench / outcompete uncontrolled growth of ‘bad’ bacteria.

When a flare has subsided, the work is not done. If you want to go into deep remission, the lifestyle changes that got you there should be applied diligently for at least 3 months after your symptoms subside to give your bowel lining time to fully heal.

*Flare management lifestyle changes I think are worth considering*

Avoid carbs. Eat quality meat & vegetables. I found that sugars, and carbs more broadly provoke bleeding. Data on carbs and inflammation point in every direction and anecdotes are contradictory. Take it for what it’s worth.

Drink green tea & ginger tea. Both are strong anti-inflammatory foods and help with stress management for me. Your innate / inflammatory immune response involves many dirty (oxidative) chemistries to signal a problem and both of these drinks are high in antioxidants that dampen these dirty chemistries.

First of all, I have been following this reddit group for a while and its been really helpful knowing your experiences to continue to fight this disease.

I'm 29M, first diagnosed with UC about 4 years ago. When I was first diagnosed with UC, I was in my home country. When I was first diagnosed with UC, I was on Mesalamine 1.2G - 1 in the morning, 2 in the evening for about a year. I had my 2nd colonoscopy after a year and a half/2 years and Dr said I seem to be in the remission but I still have to take the drug. 

Since then I have reduced the dosage of Mesalamine 1.2G just 1 at night and I have had my last colonoscopy about 2 years now overseas/my home country. I only had blood in my stood/urgency when I eat something heavy. 

Recently, I'm noticing minor pitches in my chest and with that, I start to have hard time breathing/shortness of breath for \~1min to 5mins. Once, I had this for about 30 minutes with chills, so I went to ER. They have done ECG, blood tests and angiography but they haven't found any abnormality. 

**My question to you all is, from your experience, could this be related to UC?** 

I only have this at night when I'm about to go to bed (for some strange reason), I've tried increasing and reducing dosage of Mesalamine but it seems changing the dosage doesn't have that much effect, although I've noticed completely stopping Mesalamine increases these symptoms. My Dr is saying to get an appointment with a Gastro as she thinks this may be UC related. I'm in US now so I have the appointment in a week. I would love to hear your thoughts!

Thank you!",2020-10-27 12:55:20

However, I have had periods where I lost my appetite, were bloated and had a couple of interesting symptoms: blurry vision and joint pain (especially in my hands). When I brought this up with my doctor he said that if my joint pain and blurry vision are related to UC, they would only happen during a flare. And he said I am not having a flare. 
I am wondering if anybody else with mild UC has experienced this? Could it be that since my disease is mild then my flares are mild and don’t necessarily include blood in stool and diarrhea? And do you have any suggestions on how to tackle the symptoms?",2020-10-27 02:12:36

804,My first colonoscopy experience at 23 years old and how it went (without sedation),Hazemt3,15,jjsr72,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/jjsr72/my_first_colonoscopy_experience_at_23_years_old/,32,"Sharing this here because I feel like this may help some people in the future that may be kind of worried about getting a colonoscopy. Also just wanted to share my experience!

First of all, I'm 23 years old and I've been flaring for 2 months now. I met my doctor and he put me on Prednisone before my actual diagnosis because he was convinced that I had UC and wanted to alleviate some symptoms until my colonoscopy. I had my colonoscopy yesterday after being on Pred for 9 days. Here's how it went.

The worst part without a doubt was the prep. Especially for a guy like me that has a fast metabolism and needs lots of calories, being on a liquid diet was brutal. I started my morning by having an early solid breakfast, and then the liquid diet began. I found myself hungry by lunch time so I snacked on some Jello and drank lots of liquids to feel full. One thing I can suggest is definitely drink broths. I had some broth which I boiled some green onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and mint in which I strained after, and it was WAY more satisfying than any juice or drink I could've bought from the store. Pho broth is also really good. I just feel like the savoury taste satisfies hunger more than sweetness. Then came the 2 Pico-Salax solutions which I took at 4pm and 9pm. By 9:30pm, my stool was fully clear and I thought I was empty. I woke up really hungry at 6am to take the final laxative, some Citromag. That stuff cleared me out on another level. I went 7 times from 6am-9am and releasing ungodly amounts of liquid and some solids that must've been hidden in my body for the last 5 years. No wonder they tell you to drink so much liquid, it seems like your body tries to expel every single drop of it.

10am came and it was colonoscopy time. I changed into the hospital gown and not longer after I was brought into the room. Now is where the fun begins. I naturally have very small veins, and that combined with the dehydration made them even smaller. The nurse tried putting the needle in my left arm, but couldn't get it to stay in my vein. She then moved to the right arm, same thing. Then, the moved to my right hand, which I think they succeeded, but I don't know, since I never felt any kind of sedation. At that point, the doctor just said screw it and we'd try without me feeling sedated. Not long after, I find myself consciously staring at the scope screen while the doctor fiddles around inside of me. To be honest, I found it quite cool, and being able to talk my my GI while he was doing it was definitely unique. I only felt a slight amount of pain right at first, and maybe a bit of discomfort when they were pumping air into the colon, but to be honest it wasn't bad at all. I was fully awake the entire time. After what felt like 5 minutes, it was done. Because I wasn't sedated, I almost immediately got dressed and ready to leave. The doctor actually skipped the 2 people who went before me to come talk to me because the were still letting the drugs wear off. 

The result? I have UC, and it's especially inflamed in my lower colon and close to my rectum. GI said that I would likely be progressing through different meds after my Pred, and I may eventually move to Entyvio. I guess I'm grateful it isn't something more serious. Since I'm in a flare, I had to be careful with what I ate, so I decided on something satisfying and filling that would not obliterate my digestive track. Got some good ramen and karaage chicken, and damn it felt good! Surprisingly, my digestive track did well with it and didn't become more irritated. I actually managed to sleep through the entire night for the first time in 2 months... Weird how things work sometimes.",2020-10-28 18:57:09

I’m sorry that you feel the way you do.  I’m sorry for what life has put you through.  I’m sorry that everyone ghosted you, turned their back on you and left you to weed through the pit alone.  You deserve better than that.  

But you will be better Because of that.

You will grow stronger.  You will grow braver and more discerning.  You will learn to cut the shit cuz the shit can and will cut back given enough ‘slack.’  

It’s a hard place to be, but the resolve gained will be worth its weight in gold.

I’ve had this nightmare diagnosis since 2014.  The first domino fell in 2012.  I’m 36.  

I came on here cuz I’m lonely and I have no friends of any depth for wayyy too long now and this covid hysteria doesn’t help the game much either and wanted to share.

I’ve been ghosted, scoffed, judged and mocked by just about everyone I know... but I survive.  

I am currently doing the carnivore diet and my symptoms have fallen off immensely.  No bloating!  Woot woot!  

I’m on remicade.  Been on it over a year.  It came with psoriasis.  Whattayagonna do?  I inject methotrexate for that and it’s helped with my joints.  I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has joint issues.  But I even more recommend the carni diet.

The irony of avoiding the one thing (red meat) for years turns out to be the one that that actually helps in turning things around like woah.  

Hormones are balancing.  No worry about what is gonna set me off.  I did all the diets, this one has the least guesswork and the best return...for ME.  Best of all, no after meal nothings.  Nothing.  

Just a nap.

I sleep a lot.  I hope you give yourself rest too.  DO IT.  

Listen, idk you...but if you’re reading this then...I kinda do.  Idk where you are on shits creek...but your gonna be a f’n rockstar down the line.  You’re gonna learn things about yourself, if you haven’t already, that you NEVER would have had this evil never blessed you with its burden.

I hope this finds you well and I hope you continue to learn all you can about shoring up the deficiencies, clean eating, proper supplementation, building your resolve and ability to say, ‘no,’ (mostly to noms) and to keep going because we tend to be taken to our limit only to go even further only to find relief comes beyond our breaking point.  

That’s the growth.  I wish it came some
other way.  But we’re too stubborn for that.  We are tough.  We are stronger than we know and we’re gonna make it.  

You’re gonna make it

So I have been flaring on and off for around 2 years now. 

Various IBD treatments aside, I have been taking Citalopram (20mg) to help with the anxiety and depression that unfortunately has come on strong with this disease. It has helped tremendously overall and I have been managing a lot better. 

Now a problem I have had consistently though is sleep. I just can't sleep. Everytime I lay down, I am in pain from either gas or cramp / urgency. I have become such a light sleeper and developed quite bad TMJ from the frustration. No matter what I try to ease this, relief often doesn't last long enough. I wake up multiple times with gas and urgency.

The GP has recommended trying Amitripalyine at night to help. 10mg. Now I have read this is an antidepressant, but often used for pain relief. 

Is it safe taking two different antidepressants at the same time?

Also taking Biologics, Azathioprine, Mazevant and Citalopram. No keen on yet more tablets in the mix, but I am at my whits end!

I recently got back from my first colonoscopy today. I had symptoms that consisted of: Blood on stool, mucus sometimes, constipation every so often and general discomfort that i put off for around 3 months as my symptoms dissapeared but came back. I atest this to being my first flare up with me currently being in my second bout. Anyways, after i woke up from the anesthesia, Doctor showed me some pictures and my eval chart. Turns out i have 2 small internal roids, and minute UC around my cecum. He recommended a high fiber diet, exercise and a follow up in 10 days because a biopsy was also taken as well as prescribing me Lialda 2.4g

My question is: what other precautions should i be taking? Ive basically cut out all fast food, anything greasy, and lowered my lactose intake as im pretty sure ive become more sensitive to it. I work out somewhat regularly and eat healthy for the most part. Im not really worried other than the greater risk of colon cancer as at this points theres not much i can do other than fight through the pain and discomfort

Stomach has always been irritable with emergency bathroom trips, and ribbon stool. But I'm facing a problem I've never dealt with before: constipation.

2 days ago I had a night of bad food and vodka. And woke up and couldn't go. Like as if the BM was too big to pass. No pain yet. I took some docusate sodium stool softener laxatives', and all it seems to be doing it making liquid run out and it still feels like a BM is in there. Now my stomach is actually in pain, and I'm having some rectal pain to which i never really have. I'm still trying to let it come out without pushing too hard but im afraid it will be painful when it does.

My first instinct was to freak out and to to the emergency room but I lost my job and I'm on unemployment so I waited a day. What should I do?? Call a gastroenterologist on monday and try and pay out of pocket? Wait it out and stay on the laxatives?

So I was hospitalised for an acute severe flare (Inf markers 150) and given hydrocortisone IV to reduce it to 25. Discharged and given prednisolone. Pred stopped working at 35 and I've flared again with it going between the pred working a bit and my flare. The doc now thinks based on this and my risk of another severe episode that it's ""do or die"" and I need to start Infliximab on Monday to give me options beyond surgery. However, I was diagnosed 1 year ago with moderately active pancolitis and have managed it fairly well with strict SCD and mesalazine. I don't mind starting Infliximab but there's the risk of activating latent TB which would kill me so it's not a decision I'll take lightly. I'm wondering how long do you think I can hold out in a flare? Ideally I need to hold out 10 weeks to start Vedolizumab in 2 weeks and then wait 10 or so weeks for it to kick in. Doc doesn't think I have anywhere near that much time but the alternative is so dangerous that I'm praying I can give this pred taper another go! I ate like shit out of hospital and ruined my diet but the past week I've been back on SCD with 40mg pred for 2 days and today I just had 1 BM (loose stool) with no blood or discomfort, just mild dehydration feelings.

Today I'm typing this as I removed myself from work as there is no bathroom nearby where I'm expected to be.    

The doc found mild left sided UC and put me on Balsalazide (9 pills/day, never thought I'd be taking this many pills in my life).  

The week after was manageable, though my symptoms remained largely the same as they were pre-diagnosis. I averaged roughly 4-5 loose BMs per day and even got it down to 3.  

This week? Awful.  

My stools have become more and more watery and urgent (~7-8/day), to the point where I don't feel comfortable at my work. I've also started to develop minor cramping, a symptom I never usually had. The bleeding is on and off in terms of severity ranging from low-moderate. But no significant improvement there either.  

I'm at the point where I may have to ask for less hours next week. To add extra salt to the wound, I'm sitting out from my parent's daycation as I sit home and watch my life crumble into pieces with no light at the end of the tunnel.  

I understand that it generally takes weeks, or months for relief to come from Balsalazide, but the worsening symptoms have got me very worried, and I may even need to withdraw from college this upcoming semester, which will be a massive setback considering my circumstances.  

I just don't really know what to do, or what to think at this point. All I can hope for is that I get better next week. Because I cannot function line this.",2019-08-01 20:38:33

At that time I began taking 4 Lialda pills and 1 mesalamine enema daily. One week after being on the medication I developed right side back/abdominal pain. It started off dull, became excruciating to where I was screaming, and has become dull again. During the intense pain I reached out to my GI to update my symptoms. 

A CT scan was ordered because it was thought that my gallbladder was causing problems. Results also showed abnormal CT due to cysts on left side of body next to stomach. 

Yesterday, met with doctor and we made a plan to further test my gallbladder and endoscopy/ biopsy the cysts. Bloodwork showed that my inflammation had gone down. I was happy about that. At the end of the appointment I provided another blood sample. Today, I received a phone call saying to forget the tests because my latest blood results showed elevated levels in my pancreas. I was taken off lialda. Beginning Prednisone. Will be moving up to entyvio in a month. 

Has anyone dealt with elevated pancreas levels that caused them to move off of the sulfate medication? I’ve only been diagnosed with this disease for 7 weeks and it seems so soon to move up to biologics. 

Entyvio side effects scare me. Particularly PML. I tend to get those awful random side effects of medication and am afraid.

I wanted so badly to be able to understand what the doctors and nurses were saying to my husband when he was admitted in the hospital. But all I can do now is just research about the condition and read up on whatever I can about proper diet and lifestyle changes that can health. 

I just wanted to ask, what else would be helpful during a flare up? What can I do to help him through this? What would be the best way for me to support him?",2019-08-02 04:16:33

For about a week after surgery I had soreness I would associate with normal surgical pain.  Then, after that I've had different stomach pain.  Almost like tightness/sharpness in my upper stomach, intermittent (I struggle to describe it any better).   

As for drugs, following surgery I was only on prednisone for 5 days (2 days of 10mg, then 3 days of 5mg) before getting off everything.

My surgeon was concerned with ulcers, an abscess or blood clot.  CT yesterday looked great and found nothing.  Since the negative CT, my surgeon is not concerned and doesn't really have any ideas other than wait it out (or go to the ER if it gets worse)? 

Anyone else had a similar experience?  Any suggestions?",2019-08-03 13:50:18

I was diagnosed the middle of the summer.  Today, two days before I go down to 20mg a day, my stools seem to be returning to the pre-prednisone state.  I have no stomach pain.  But I’m feeling the need to go to the bathroom more urgently, and the stools aren’t those solid snakes they were the day before.  They’re pellets that just fall out of my ass.  Mucus.  No blood.  Should I be worried that I’ll go back to my flared state after the prednisone?  I was really hoping that after prednisone I would be in remission.  With the prednisone, I’ve felt pretty much like a normal human, bowel-wise. 

I’m especially concerned because I go back to school right after my taper is done, far away from my doctor, on the other side of the country.

After reading a fair bit on this sub I wanted to make my first post, more specifically to ask for diet advice.

First off, before I was diagnosed, when I first started showing symptoms I assumed it was just my poor diet and lack of exercise. But the diarrhea (and other symptoms) never went away. This continued until I had a colonoscopy performed back in 2017 and my doctor gave me the diagnosis. Now I am on predisolone, azathioprine, mezaline and infliximab. The predisolone and azathioprine were for/are for another auto-immune disease but I'm still on them. I noticed the infliximab having a positive effect on me but not enough for the inflamation to settle down for long enough that my stomach can heal. For a while, I thought that having constant diarrhea and stomach pain were just my new life until I found out that you can go into remission, thanks to this sub.

Now from my understanding, it's different for everyone and I understand that, I am just looking for general guidelines and precautions. I have never really paid attention to what I've been eating until now. I've been quite eager to start trying to find out what foods are good/bad for me.

So, what foods do you gravitate to during a flare and which ones do you avoid? Are there any rules? Are there any specific signs a food is bad for you when you're already having symptoms? e.g Blood in stool, increased usage of toilet. I have tried porridge but considering the urgent diarrhea immediately after eating I am assuming it is not for me. If you would like more details I would be more than happy to share.

Edit: Thank you for the responses! I am currently trying to limit my diet to very basic foods (soup, soft breads, water) and I am noticing improvements. I will update on another post how things go from here.",2019-08-03 06:28:44

I have ibd (ulcerative colitis) for over two years now and im currently 22 years old. So far i've been on al kinds of medication and most of it worked only for a short while. My current medication wich shuts down parts of the immune system is becoming less effective as well.

After all this time i actually gor used to the pain but the most frustrating thing is that working out is very hard, as i have very little energy everyday and it slows the healing proces of the colon. And i can't go out with friends as the lack of sleep or just a few drinks will mess everything up.

As a student i used to go out once a week and work out four times a week but that lifestile is slowly getting very hard as i currently still have a below average body mass after 3 years of training and dieting, and most parties result in heading home early due to pains. 

Especially last 6 months i've had a very healthy life style but even then every step forward just seems to come with three steps back. 

Even though the frustrating nature of this i'm trying to stay positive. In 3 days i will get a call from my doctor to see if the inflammation has worsened or not and i'm not yet at the end of the line for my treatment. Getting depressed will only make things worse so ill try to enjoy the moments when i do have energy. 

I just felt i needed to get this out of my system because most people don't seem to understand how much working out and these social activities mean to me, they'll say ""but then don't do the things that make you sick"" which is true, but not as easy as it sounds.

Now that that's out of my system, feel free to share some of your frustrations as well. Hopefully it can help you stay possitive as well.",2019-08-03 03:31:41

Blood tests were fine aswell and my latest ones were at beginning of last week before that one, then I saw my GI who said everything was going fine and that she'll be testing me again in 6 months.

After those good news, last week was my birthday, so I decided to treat myself and eat a full meal of tempuras and red bean icecream. Didnt feel any different in the next days but on thursday I wasn't feeling so good and there it was, a tiny drop of blood on the toilet paper. The size of a dot, but still, blood. The days after, I got lose stools and went 4 times but no blood. Today my stools were a bit more solid, so that felt good, but i had a little bit of faded pink mucus on the paper. Couldn't really see my stools in the toilets, they seemed normal but mucusy.

I had seen my doctor last week and he told me to not worry about a tiny speck of blood. But I'm a very anxious person so that doesn't help.

&#x200B;

My name is Will, I am 20, living in the UK, and was diagnosed two years ago on the 16th of December, 2017 with moderately active UC. Since then, my life has been quite the mess, I've pretty much had one large, consistent flare since with the only breaks in the disease being when I'm on corticosteroids, which (sadly) are not a long term solution. I've found the symptoms of my disease pretty extreme, I've had to drop college, turn down multiple jobs and I'm living with my parents and no income, since I can't really do much else due to the symptoms. As of the past few weeks, the specialist has found that the disease has become severe and has spread.

&#x200B;

It's also worth mentioning that I have tried many different treatments including but not limited to Immunosuppression, anti-inflammatories and other types of steroids. None of which have worked.

&#x200B;

I've been reluctant to speak to anyone at all other than my health specialists about the disease, but since things have gotten a lot worse, I figured I might as well (With a lot of persuasion from my mother).

What're you guys' ways of managing things when they get bad, and do you have any recommendations/tips for someone in my situation?

I live in this province specifically, https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/news/local/39-cancer-patients-died-while-still-on-wait-list-for-gastroenterologist-study-304737/

In October of 2017 I was tentatively diagnosed upon admission to the hospital, they weren't sure what kind of Colitis immediately, but knew it was Colitis, Chrons or IBD. Constant calling led to a scope in January 2018 that confirmed my UC diagnosis. 

I have only been able to get into a clinic and deal with IUD and women's issues, every other clinic just refers me to the team of GI specialists in Halifax (which is not close to me at all, but is the only clinic of its sort here). 

I was working full time 80-100 hours a week self employed when this all went down, I finished out my contracts post hospitalization and slowed down. In December 2018, I changed from self employment (still around 60 hours a week) to a bank job at 40 hours a week, but it turns out I'll likely be leaving that soon too - in favour of even less hours.

I am not medicated beyond Marijuana, my partner and I are going through 5 ounces a month right now just to keep my pain managed. 

I am in pain every 2-3 days, have the massive waves of cramps that come with stool back up about once a week - despite the usual 10-15 trips a day to use the washroom.

I only eat foods that don't make me sick, but every day it feels like more and more make me sick - on top of food allergies and already known sensitivities. 

I was just on vacation for two weeks, I was supposed to return to work yesterday but I've started dry heaving and having really bad nausea in the mornings. Yesterday I called in sick - I've used 5 sick days, 4 personal days and 4 vacation days since December due to Colitis issues.

I'm fatigued daily, I wake up over night 2-3 times a night just to go to the bathroom or from cramps - and since I usually can't get back to sleep post bathroom pains I smoke some weed and lay down and hope for the best. My magic bag almost never leaves my lap. 

The only meds I have access to are Buscopan and Tylenol 1's. 

Any ideas or things safe for UC patients over the counter for sleep would be nice, any tips you've used to stay motivated and happy would also be great. 

I'm very fortunate in one aspect, my partner, well, he's amazing. He sees me struggle and just supports me. He's even joined this subreddit to help him better understand the things I can't explain.

I guess  I just wanted to vent, and get it out. I'm in my office close to tears writing this. I don't even have a family practitioner, I've been on a waitlist now for 5 years. I've been bumped off of it a few times, I found out WHY. Turned out my doc from 2004-2011, was still listed as my primary care physician. I called his office today, his assistant is going to see if he will see me again OR how we can clear up the issue with our health care ministry who manages the waitlist.

I also have the following health concerns, which complicate things even more:

Psoriasis (since age 2, am 31 now)
Psoriatic arthritis, since age 16
PCOS, not sure how long, diagnosed as an early teen
Endometriosis, diagnosed as an early teen
CPTSD, from child hood abuse and other severe traumatic events 
Asthma since age 2
(I'm a big ball of funnnnnnn).

I'm not looking for medical advice, just tips on how to advocate maybe? Diets? I don't know what I'm looking for, I'm just breaking down and rambling and this was the safest place to go to.",2019-08-08 19:41:41

After my colonoscopy in February I started taking Octasa Modified Release tablets (Mesalazine) and I immediately felt the benefits. After the first week I experienced a bit of painful bloating but after reducing my dose that went away and I experienced “normal” day to day bowel use.

I ran out of Mesalazine a few weeks ago, was off them for roughly 3 weeks while I sorted out a pick up point and hospital appointments. I managed to start them again, but they aren’t reacting in the same way. My symptoms are lesser, but not completely gone even though I’ve been taking them for a couple of weeks. I’m also experiencing a lot of nausea and tiredness. I’m struggling to eat, the idea of food makes me want to throw up. The smell of it makes me want to throw up. I’m struggling to finish even half portions because of the nausea, but if I don’t eat it just gets worse.

Some days I can eat like I’ve been starving all of my life, and some days I can’t even look at something such as eggs without literally gagging, and sometimes even vomiting. I know it’s not the food because I can house it easily on other days, but it’s just so random to the point where it’s starting to become a bit unhealthy because I can barely eat sometimes, or eating is a battle because I feel extremely nauseous when doing so. 

So my question is; does anyone else deal with random bouts of anxiety when eating? (My anxiety isn’t totally geared toward me having to run to the bathroom immediately after eating, but rather just eating in general somedays).  And how do you guys combat that?

I’m not one for anti anxiety medication, pain medication, etc. so those aren’t really choices for me. The only type of medicating I do is smoking weed from time to time which calms me down and my anxiety is out the window in that case, but normal functioning adults can’t just smoke every minute of every day (or at least I can’t, lol) so there’s my dilemma. 

Appreciate all the support you guys constantly give ❤️

Went to the hospital and they said that it may be a strong virus (they had many patient with diarrea) , that's OK for me. The day after my stool was without blood, malformed but not bad. 

Got back home and suddenly my joints started to hurt a lot,  first ankle and hips and then all my back. This for 3 days. Poop keept getting better but not totally.

(My first one being in 2010 and the last one in July 2018.) 

I started feeling off  on August 1st and pretty much stopped eating anything other than the bland food/Ensure I had during my last flare since then. So far I'm only going to the bathroom 2-3 times, no diarrhea though my normal BMs look more like ones I have when sick and not eating solids. Noticed some blood spotted in the actual poop and dark pink when I wipe, but not every time. No bright red blood. I do have cramping/pain but not constantly and I can ride it out and not go to the bathroom.

I am on Mezavant 4.8G and 150mg Imuran. I also picked up Salofalk suppositories and am using them at night. Planning to book an appt with my GI on Monday as a precaution/have my GP on standby as the latter is faster to access. I also have a bottle of Prednisone at home, but I don't want to go back on it if I don't need to. So I have some questions for y'all:

* Are small flares common in UC or is it a go big or go home thing? 
* Could I maintain this sort of situation as it is with what I'm doing and have it relax on its on? 
* If you have small flares what do you do and how long does it take you to feel better?

I know everyone is different - hell, I'm the queen of saying that on here LOL - but just hearing some stories might help me calm down. So far I only have my mom's (she also has UC) anecdotal stuff of healing her flare after a month of bland food. I'm worried about this escalating and A) taking Prednisone, B) re-evaluating my medication which has been a godsend all this time, and C) missing work which I absolutely do not want.

My flare symptoms are starting to slowly creep back up again. I’ve been taking Humira weekly now for about 5 months. Before that I was taking it Bi-weekly for 3 months.  It seems the Prednisone is what made me feeling great, and I do *not* want to up my dosage again. 

The Humira doesn’t seem to be working and I sent a note to my doctor. He said in the past if Humira doesn’t work, we would go with Entyvio. 

Just curious, how long did it take you to find the right Maintenance Drug for you? I really though Humira would be the one, but looks like I may have to go another route.",2019-08-11 06:54:05

During those 3 years of writting down everything that for some reason made my stomach go wild my hair started falling like never before to the point where i started unclogging moderate ammounts of hair out of the shower after every bath.

I was just wondering if anyone here was familiar with the testing process for Chrohn's vs UC? 
For instance, could Chrohn's look like UC on a colonscopy?
The reason i ask is that i was diagnosed with UC about a year ago which has been pretty unresponsive to the meds ive been given so far. 

I was wanting to get people's experience as i dont want to raise it with my GI, if he would have determined it by colonscopy. The doctor is a bit miffed as to why its been unresponsive to the treatment and my normal gp says he hasnt nornally seen these kind of complications with UC

I have an  urgent colonscopy scheduled next month, i was wondering if maybe i should be doing a gastroscopy just in case.

Thanks for your feedback in advance

First thing is I love looking at everybody’s post about this disease cuz I find it cool that there truly are people like me with this disease that I can talk to! So I was diagnosed with UC about a week ago and I am 18 years old. I’ve had some symptoms for about 5 months now before I got the colonoscopy which were bleeding in my stool and using the bathroom frequently but not as much as everyone else I find on here or as painful. I’ve never had any stomach pain or cramps of any sort only just the bloody stools. As of now I feel like it’s in remission because everything is back to normal like bowel movements only once a day and no blood in the stools and this was even before the doctor gave me mesalamine. So I guess I’m just confused on how some people suffer so badly and others like me are basically just normal and maybe have a flare up once and it never comes back. Anybody like that who are basically just normal?,2019-08-12 02:18:29

I have recently been to the consultant as it was a compulsory meeting after the Colonoscapy and have mentioned that the medication that I'm currently on (Asacol) isn't working at all and I'm still getting severe bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps urgency and weight loss. This is causing dehydration and ""ring stinging"" which isn't very pleasant. She has maximised my medication to 3.2g which is 6 tablets a day where as before I was on 4 a day.

I was told that they are reluctant to give steroids and only do that as a last resort. For now I can only take the maximum dose of Asacol and some new tablet that is inserted through the Anus which I'm not too sure about. A enema was also mentioned as alternative treatment but I just feel frustrated and want to start on immunopressants but they are very reluctant to do that and I'm not sure what to do in this situation.

I have another review now in October for them just to probably tell me exactly the same thing so that means at least 2 more months of a constant flare up which as you know is very uncomfortable and exhausting.",2019-08-13 16:59:59

*This post was last revised September 19, 2019.*

Here I have compiled data on the effectiveness of medications used to treat ulcerative colitis, as compared to placebos or to other medications.

###Risk Ratios (RRs)

All values here are shown as [risk ratios (RR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_ratio). An RR compares the risk of adverse outcomes—here, typically, a flare. An RR of 0.5 means half the risk of an adverse outcome compared to the control. An RR of 1.0 means equal risk (and an ineffective treatment). An RR greater than 1.0 means more risk (and a treatment potentially causing more harm than good).

###How to compare RRs

RRs can only be directly compared **within the same study**. In that case, the lower the better.

RRs **cannot** be compared across studies because different studies define things differently. For example, “remission” means many different things and can be measured at different times—after eight weeks, one year, etc.

If one treatment has an RR of 0.72 and another 0.84 in a different study, that doesn't necessarily mean that one is better than the other but rather that they both work, as defined in their particular studies.

###Important notes

The demographics of the people involved in each study may be different. For example, some studies are only for people who have failed steroids. This information is *not* currently reflected here, nor is the size of each study.

In order for a treatment to be included here, there had to be a study comparing it against something else. Sometimes it is not ethical to compare against a placebo when it puts a patient at risk. Therefore some of these compare two treatments.

###Disclaimer

***Before making any medical decisions based on this information, examine the original studies.*** All studies are cited and linked to here.

I cannot guarantee the values here are accurate. Please contact me if you find any errors and I will do my best to correct them.

**Notes**

As best I can tell there has been no direct comparison of prednisone versus a placebo since 1960, in a single study which also said it was the first. That study was very small (37 people). These values have been accepted as fact since then. More recent studies comparing new corticosteroids versus prednisone have shown them to be similarly effective, yet those new corticosteroids versus *placebos* have shown them to be much less effective than prenisone in the 1960 study. Therefore, the validity of the prednisone data should be questioned.

My husband has had UC for about 13 - 14 years now and he's been on remicade for about 12 years. We recently moved for him to start a new job - we currently have two different insurances - one through my work and one through his new work. We were waiting to make sure everything was good with the new insurance before canceling the one through my work (it's more expensive and not great) 

He has had one infusion since we've moved and he's overdue to got back because between our TWO insurances no one wants to pay for it. The new insurance sent a letter about them deeming its not medically necessary therefore they will not pay - but we can appeal which will take 30 days. We requested an expedited appeal... which they refused. 

&#x200B;

My question is - has anyone else gone through this? We can't get ahold of his doctor, the infusion center has told us they can't do anything, and the insurance has basically told us they don't care.

Any help or recommendations is MUCH APPRECIATED.",2019-08-14 23:52:49

For the first time in 4 years with UC, my CRP is under 7. This summer has been definitely the hardest of my life. I started flaring really hard in may because Remicade was not working anymore (after 2 years). I didn't developpe antibodies but it was just not working anymore, I was taking the maximum dose every 3 weeks and I still had symptoms. On june 15 it got worse... My biggest flare up to this day started at my girlfriend's prom. I had like 15-20 bms a day (only blood and mucus most of the time). I started panicking because I had my first infusion of ENTYVIO on may 28th and my second on june 14th so I thought that ENTYVIO was just not working but everyone and my doctor were telling me that I had to be patient. A couple days later I was on 40mg of prednisone and even with the prednisone it took me 2 weeks to really get better. I had my 3rd infusion of ENTYVIO on July 18 and since then I'm not the same. ENTYVIO is not like Remicade (The next day you already feel better and your stools are looking better) it takes time. The week after my 3rd infusion I went from 5 bms a day to only 2 solid bms (no blood, no mucus). I'm still on 20mg of prednisone but for the first time in 4 years my CRP is under 7. I've never been there in the last 4 years even with Remicade and 40mg of prednisone. Now the only thing is my anemia (7.4 hemoglobin) and my colon didn't have the time to completely heal so I have to be careful with what I eat.

Suprep is HORRIBLE. It tastes disgusting and makes me so nauseous. Upside is you don’t have to drink as much as some of the other preps.

Golytley/gavilyte don’t taste too bad but you have to drink A TON and it makes me feel so nauseous and bloated.

Miralax isn’t too bad but you have to drink a lot. Doesn’t really taste like anything though.

The best BY FAR is clenpiq. You just have to drink two little bottles and stay hydrated. It tastes like cranberry and really isn’t that unpleasant.

Next time you have to have a colonoscopy ask your doctor if they can prescribe you Clenpiq. You may have to check that your insurance covers it but it is totally worth it!",2019-08-15 05:36:40

I had surgery almost a year ago and no longer have UC except for the small bit left in my rectum. I had it for 17 years, used all of the FDA approved medicines, spices, probiotics, diets, you name it. I spent about 95% of those 17 years on prednisone.

Now, at the ripe old age of 33, both of my knees are swollen, they're painful to walk on, and I can't kneel and lean back on my feet. Which is important as I find I need to do that alot with a 2yr old at home.

My question is, none of the biologics worked for me, and most of them are used to actually treat arthritis. Like Humira for instance is what my dad uses. Have I eliminated these as options to treat arthritis now? Or they just weren't effect for UC anymore?

Earlier this month I had a troph level taken (blood level taken just before my humira injection) and the doctor found my humira level was low and I also developed antibodies to the biologic. Because of this, they suggested I try a new Biologic (entyvio if it matters) instead of the humira.


Today would be my next injection and I have 2 pens left. I asked my doctor when we were discussing things if I should take my next injection and she said taking it wouldn't hurt anything but it also wouldn't be beneficial because of the antibodies.

I don't see a lot of people talking about this, although i have seen one poster here talk about making his own butyrate enemas which i thought was a brilliant idea. We all know that there is more than enough science available to justify altering diet in order to increase butyrate production. Although what exactly is the significance of this SCFA? I tried watching a video on it and it was pretty complex, it looked like it only functions one part of this enourmously complex inflammation process. But can it actually visibly reduce ulceration size and intensity?

My GI was shocked when i told him i didnt eat any plant based foods, i won't forget his face when he said ""But short chain faty acids?!"". I have been doing this for almost a year now and going to test my new inflammation markers after i got a whopping 3k calpro a couple months ago. I switched to higher quality foods (less grain fed animals, more wild caught fish (more omega-3, less omega-6 and toxins basically)) and been symptom free most of the time pretty much. 

My mind exploded when i discovered last week that there's actually a bacteria that can turn animal amino acids into butyrate \[1\]. Our gut microbiomes are obviously fucked so it makes sense that some of us dont have this bacterium or only in super small amounts. In theory, if we find a source / donor which has these strains, we can reap the same benefits as plant based people have but on an animal based low fiber diet.

I know there havent been studies about using intestinimonas bacteria for IBD therapy, but it makes sense right? doctors want you to have butyrate, they think fiber is the only source, therefore reccomend you a plant based diet (which for some people tears their colon to shreds). But this might change. Please share your opinions and experience!

How do you know which food is making it worse? Like, is it immediately after you eat a specific food, the day after, two days after? I think full digestion takes in general about 40 hours for women, and a bit less for men, so a lot of food gets in during this amount of time.

I was diagnosed on August 1st and miraculously, managed to have no blood since then, until last Monday night. Out of the blue, blood in my stools. Again. It's been 5 days now and I don't seem to get any better, everything I eat hurts at some point :(  So now I am wondering, was it what I ate during the weekend, or what I ate on Monday that is most likely to have triggered the flare up?  I did not skip my medication, so I know it isn't that for sure... Thanks for the help, I would really appreciate some tips here.",2019-08-17 16:04:36

I've had UC for almost 10 years now.  I've had 5-6 flares in that time.  Some of them responded to prednisone and mesalamine, and some didn't.  Two years ago I got fed up and went to see a holistic doctor who put me on a grain, dairy, fruit, alcohol, sugar free diet and gave me two forms of supplements (that he makes himself),  and everything turned around in 5 days.  Everything was great until last winter.  I was spiraling mentally/emotionally (nothing to do with the UC just mental illness stuff);  Drank too much and ate pretty much all of the things I wasn't supposed to because I felt invincible from the UC and apathetic from the mental illness.  Well, I'm an idiot and now the flare is back with a vengeance and nothing is working, including the diet/supplement plan from two years ago.  I was in between GIs and PCPs when this started earlier in the year.  I finally got into see a PCP after months of severe symptoms who is being super helpful, but her expertise in the IBD area is limited.  The 5 former GIs that I have seen are old crotchety males who do not listen to a young woman's opinions or concerns about her own body.  The PCP gave me a referral to a GI program 30 minutes away, but I called and they can't get me in until JANUARY.  I'm pretty sure I'll be dead by January if I keep going on this way.  I have been to the ER several times hoping they will admit me and give me IV steroids because when oral medications haven't worked in the past, the IV steroids did.  Each time they refuse to admit me because my blood work looks 'spectacular'.  They did CT scans and said I have mild constipation in my small intestine and 'mild inflammation' in my colon.  THERE IS NOTHING MILD ABOUT THE INFLAMMATION according to my symptoms.   One ER doctor tried to give me a laxative for the constipation and I would've thrown it at her if I wasn't so messed up on morphine.  I refused to take it and she kicked me out of the hospital at 4am high as a kite.  I'm losing faith in the Health Care system.  I don't know what to do.  No one is listening to me that I'm in pain and symptoms are getting worse and worse.  I haven't been able to eat solid foods all summer.  I have daily mental breakdowns.  I had to take a leave from work that I'm not getting paid for.  I set up a GoFundMe to help me through, but it is dwindling and I'm going to be broke soon.  I don't know what to do.  Can anyone out there offer me some advice?  I'm sick of calling doctors and pleading and having to convince them that I'm sick.  I have no energy for this.

I'm not a doctor obviously, but I have a feeling oral medications are not working because of the constipation is blocking the inflammation.  I'm currently taking Rowasa enema, and Lialda.  I've been prescribed the steroid foam, but it is on backorder and nobody in the state has it in stock.  I can't fucking win anything right now.  I feel like the whole universe is against me.  

Thanks for reading.  Any advice or responses are helpful.  All of your posts have been very informative to me and given me a little bit of hope.

So I wrote a few days ago how the health care system has been failing me.... I've been pushing my PCP (still can't get in to see a GI) to get some sort of topical steroid because I feel like anything oral has not been effective.  The inflammation is too low for the oral medication, and too high for suppositories.  I started the Rowasa enema about a week ago and saw no difference.  (I've had just straight up blood and mucus with little to no stool coming out for 3 months).  I tried to get the steroid foam, but no one in the state has it and it's on backorder.  The pharmacist recommended the cream, which again wouldn't ideally get far enough up to touch the inflammation, but I'm pretty much trying everything at this point.  My strategy though was to get the cream further up by using the Rowasa immediately after to cream to give it a little boost.  I did this yesterday afternoon and took a long nap.  That evening I woke up and had BLOOD FREE diarrhea twice.  And you know the feeling after a bowel movement in a flare that you didn't really get any relief from it?  It feels the same as if you didn't sit on the toilet for 45 minutes.  Well I didn't have that feeling.  I felt relief.  I was so delighted at my success that I did the same exact thing before I went to bed.  Woke up this morning to diarrhea again, but NO BLOOD and felt that same relief after!!!!  So that's 3 bowel movements in a row without bleeding.  I haven't seen actual brown stool in 3 months.  I'm overjoyed and had to share with you guys.  I was on 60mg of steroids for a month and it did nothing.  I had little to no faith in this cream because the topical Mesalamine didn't seem to be doing anything.  Nothing I was taking did anything.  Steroid cream recommended by a CVS pharmacist, shot up into place by the Rowasa....who woulda thought??  EEEEEeeeee!!",2019-08-22 20:10:23

I went to the hospital and they said it’s most likely a tear that can be fixed through surgery. I didn’t think much of it, I thought I’d have the surgery and I’d be okay. Well after the surgery and after I fully recover from being put to sleep I’m told the news. I didn’t think it was bad until I realized the consequences of it all. I started to experience more bathroom problems after this surgery for some odd reason, from May (when I had surgery) to my birthday (June 9th) I lost around 8 pounds due to loss of appetite. This was all so heart breaking to me, I forgot to mention I’m a basketball player, I had tryouts the day after surgery and the doctors told me I couldn’t do it. This was probably the most depressing point of my life, as basketball meant everything to me and I had to quit it. I started to be stuck in my house and I didn’t wanna leave, it was so sad and everyone was feeling pity for me as I mentally and physically broke down. They gave me medicine but it didn’t lead to much, they then put me on steroids which I’m sure many of u have experienced, I’ve since gained 6 of the 8 pounds loss back and I’ve fixed my diet, but I still cannot physically so much as I am anemic and I just get dizzy really fast so they gave me on iron supplements. I recently finished my steroids and I started to feel bad again, I had a bad experience at school and had to go really bad and then left due to I couldn’t go any longer, I just received more steroids and I’m getting a new prescription of steroids to last me till they can fix my medicine. I know I may not have the worst case ever but I thought I’d share my story. To any athletes who suffered this I know it’s difficult and I feel your pain, but I’ve found my way around, I’m now doing a sports blog for my high school and I’m doing film for basketball games. 

I’m sorry for anyone who’s gone through all of this because I know, especially for athletes, it can be hard, if you’re someone who doesn’t move around so much or do much in the first place it may not affect you as much as me, but I pray for every single one of you that you get to your comfortable spot and get back to a normal life, as I’m on this journey to do it with you.

I’ve recently had my third loading dose of remicade and I wanted to hear a bit about other peoples experiences to see if what I’m dealing with is normal for when I follow up with my GI in a couple weeks. Along with the remicade I’m on 6 tabs of asacol a day, 25mg of prednisone in the morning and 15mg in the evening. 
I’m still having quite a bit of diarrhea with some occasional urgency and blood but definitely improving from before starting the remicade. 
Some questions I have: 

Do you get your doses every 8 wks? Any experiences with a shorter interval between doses? I’m considering suggesting this as my symptoms got significantly worse the closer to my next dose the last time around. 
How long did it take for you to achieve relief? And than remission? And what is your definition of both? If you were on prednisone at what point did you start tapering? 
If you’ve failed remicade what was the circumstances/symptoms leading up to it and did it happen after a period of relief/remission? What did hi move onto next? 
What do you do before, during and after your infusions? Both for your physical and mental health? 
If you’ve been on remicade long term (years) what’s your new normal? How often do you see your GI and get tests done?

1130,A whinge about Prednisone,MephMitchell,6,cvowa4,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/cvowa4/a_whinge_about_prednisone/,2,"Last week I had a flexi-sig to see if my flare is bad enough for my doctor to start me on entyvio. Currently I'm on 4g mesalazine granules, 1g salofalk enema at night, 5mg Prednisone suppository in the morning and 100mg mercaptopurine. 

The result from the flexi-sig were mixed. On the positive side the medication I'm taking is working, but there's a small area of flare above where the enema reaches. 

I'm not sure if I'd consider all of that medication to be ""working"" if i still have a flare. But that's just me being grumpy at my own intestines. 

So in my half asleep daze as I'm waking up in the hospital after the anesthetic, the doctor comes over and explains the results. She then asks the question I had been dreading for a few days before. ""How are you with Prednisone?"" This is a newish doctor for me, incredibly bright and given me so much more confidence in my options for my condition than my previous gastroenterologist. But she doesn't remember the horror stories I told her of my previous doctor putting me on Prednisone. 

I have been on it twice before and both times had similar experiences. Starting out on 40mg for a few weeks then tapering down by 5mg. Obviously I have a low tolerance for Prednisone because the first few weeks of this I can barely function. I will be awake for 24 hours after taking the Prednisone unless I load up on sleeping pills. I'm nervous, my heart pounding through my chest at all hours of the day and I get jittery, anxious, paranoid and can get so focused on worrying about something (like having to be awake in X hours for work) to the point that I have a panic attack. The last time I took it I had two months off work just to reduce my stress levels. 

So I gave her the best, short explanation of that i could in my groggy, post anesthetised state.

My doctor doesn't want to start me on entyvio for just a small flare and would like me to try Prednisone again. I negotiate a middle ground of a 20mg dose, as it is where I remember I started to feel human again after tapering down the last couple of times. She agrees on a short course starting at 20 mg.

Fast forward to today and I'm laying in bed at midnight after what can only be described as a brief nap. My heart racing, stuck in a stress loop of thoughts about something that is completely out of my control. I fell asleep feeling ok, but the Prednisone decided that no, I really did need to think some more about this tiny bit of stress in my life. 
This is the second night in a row it has done this. Thankfully the lower dose has spared me the shortness of breath and panic attacks where I shake and struggle to breathe, yet do so quietly so as to not wake my sleeping wife. I guess I'll just go have a valium or something to see if I can get back to sleep. 

Thankfully my work understand my condition, I think I'll call them in the morning and ask for the week off. It's only a short course and I should be down to 10mg by Monday, which isn't enough to break my brain.

This isn't really a rant, it could be much worse. I just hate this stuff and I wish I had a better tolerance to it. To end on a positive note I can feel the symptoms of my flare going down after just 4 days on it. Just have to hope it doesn't come straight back when I start tapering off.

I just want all my thoughts in one spot. I'm sick of this stupid disease. I know people have it worse than me, too. I just can't deal with it right now.

I've only gotten diagnosed with UC (and gastritis) less than two weeks ago. I have pancolitis, but the colonoscopy results said it was moderate. I got put on prednisone and omeprazole and am already tapering off prednisone, but I feel like my symptoms haven't changed much. The only difference is the stomach cramps. Instead of constant dull pain, they come and go but way, way more intense. I'm supposed to start mesalamine two weeks into my prednisone prescription. I've had symptoms since October but only had this really bad flare up for the past month or two.

Everything I eat hurts my stomach so much. I drank a mouthful of water to take my omeprazole, then lied down. My stomach hurt so incredibly bad, the worst it's been. I felt like I was getting punched from the inside out. I started sweating and fidgeting and ended up using the restroom for the umpteenth time today. Who knew water could be a trigger? I sure didn't.

The stress my mom puts on me doesn't help either. She thinks the prednisone isn't working and I should stop taking the omeprazole. And doesn't want me to start on mesalamine because of the side effects. She keeps sending me things of people who went into remission by drinking cabbage juice everyday or they went to a doctor who diagnosed them with a fungus (???) Or stories of people who go gluten free/vegan/dairy free and feel better. She wants me to get allergy tested, but I'm so tired of having my blood drawn because I was in the hospital for three days and had to get blood drawn every four hours to test my hemoglobin because, surprise, I'm anemic.

I've been having blood-tinged stool with mucus for almost 2 months now. I had a colonoscopy a month ago and it showed mild proctitis. A definitive diagnosis of IBD hasn't been given because I haven't seen a GI specialist yet. Biopsies were taken, no cancer. I was put on mesalazine suppositories. They haven't helped. In fact I'm going to the toilet at least 6 to 8 times a day now, with some blood in most of my bowel movements. Previously I'd go to the toilet maybe 4 times a day. I get intense cramping in my lower abdomen and have to go to the toilet straight away, then the pain goes away.

In the last 2 days after repeated toilet visits over an hour in the morning, I've passed out blood. Just blood with no stools. During those times, it feels like my guts are going to come out of my rear end. It's an intense feeling. I'm scared. I'm going to see a doctor in an hour but I'm scared to even eat now.

It went really well. My “surgeon to be” lol is at Scripps medical center in La Jolla. He basically told me everything I had already researched and also that I am a candidate for the 3 step surgery (if I choose to go through with steps 2 and 3) 

I brought my mom with me as another set of ears because I didn’t know if it would be overwhelming. It actually wasn’t. It was very informative! He did an exam also which was interesting because that was the first sigmoid I’ve ever had where I wasn’t put under sedation. Haha. 

I currently am on week 6 of the Xeljanz, and my gastro doc told me it can take up to 6-8 months for some ppl to notice an improvement. Since this is the last medication I am willing to be on before I decide on surgery I want to give it at least the full 6 months to see if I notice anything. That puts me around January. If  there are no improvements, I will have the surgery and that’s really exciting to me because that means that in these last 9 years that I’ve felt like utter shit I can finally embrace a new year feeling like my old self again and taking my life back! 

I don’t really get emotional about my colitis anymore but the one thing that does make me emotional is thinking how I won’t have to live with it for much longer! No more anxiety, about finding a restroom to use, no more frustration with meds that don’t work, the satisfaction of being able to enjoy the foods I love that usually hurt me (in moderation of course!) 

I know this is a big decision but I’ve really thought it through and come to terms with it and I see it as the best thing ever :)",2019-08-27 05:09:41

On past flare ups I was on steroids 2 times for a couple of months. But today my doctor said 3rd time when a patient is required to take steroids it usually means they might need some other medication than mesalamine, and he mentioned remicade might be suitable. We'll talk about the details tomorrow after my sigmoidoscopy but I don't want to take any other medication other than meselamine and steroids at this time  because I'm still pretty young(21) and feel like this would mean that I wouldn't have any other medicaiton to fall back on if things gets real bad, maybe short time steroid use might be enough for my remission.

My biggest dream was to go on an African Safari...so I did.  I went to Kenya for 11 days and traveled around the southwest corner of the country.  It was an amazing trip.  Luckily, there were a lot of bathroom breaks built into the trip where our tour guides stopped at souvenir shops that have more westernized toilets.  I had zero incidents while I was there...until the last day.  We are leaving the Maasai Mara.  We stop for a moment to watch 5 cheetahs feasting on a waterbuck they took down.  All of a sudden, that urgency hit.  I tell my driver that I have to poop now.  He asked if I could wait.  I said NO!  So, we drive like maybe 1000 feet away from the cheetahs and I jump out the jeep to poop in the bushes while our driver is around the back of the jeep to make sure no animals come try to kill me.  So, there I am in one of the most beautiful places in the world watching nature at its finest while taking a poop in the bushes.  I left a piece of me in Kenya that day.

&#x200B;

Throughout the whole tour, our group (who were all strangers to me just a week and a half earlier) joked that our tour was the babies and butts tour.  We saw tons of baby animals and saw so many animal butts because they loved to turn around when we pulled up to all the animals to take photos.  When I got back in the jeep after my special bathroom break, I informed the jeep that if anyone decided to stop watching the cheetahs and look to their right, they would have gotten quite the view of me pooping in the bushes since there is not much tree or bush cover in the Maasai.  One of my group members chimed in ""THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE REAL BUTT SHOT!""  We all cracked up laughing together. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I am telling you all this that don't let this disease stop you.  A few weeks before Kenya I started flaring up.  I just planned the best I could while there.  Luckily, most of our meals were after our game drives so I didn't have too many problem on the drives.  But when we had to travel between locations, I would have a very light breakfast of foods that tend not to bother me or skip it all together until we got to our next destination.  Since I have been back (just over a week), my flare is getting worse.  I am getting blood work on Friday (I had my doc throw in tests for stomach parasites in case I picked up anything in Kenya which I doubt I did) and I will see him soon next month to get this back under control.  This disease sucks.  But I won't let it steal my life from me.  I make the best of my situation and keep pushing to make all my dreams come true.",2019-08-28 14:30:02

I’ve been following this community for a while now and decided to make an account to ask a question since nothing really came up in the search function. 

My finger and toe nails are all severely clubbed. They’ve been clubbed since maybe 2009 when I was in high school and my father was the first to notice. It started out very minor and basically gotten worse over the years and besides feeling extremely fatigued, I haven’t really had many symptoms of UC (had diarrhea for about a year but it disappeared when I started taking probiotics). 

The only reason I’ve been diagnosed with UC is because my girlfriend persisted that I get my nails checked again. I had them checked back in 2011 and again maybe in 2013. Basically the doctors did heart, lung, and blood tests and found nothing. I went to a internal medicine specialist back in January and since then, we’ve discovered that I have a mild case of UC. Nothing else though. They tested for PSC through an MRI two weeks ago and it came back negative.

Does anyone else in this subreddit have nail clubbing (also called digital clubbing)? Can there be another cause for this? From my understanding, it’s a rare side effect of UC but my case is mild so I want to rule out that it’s nothing else. The doctors have said that it’s because of UC but it’s so strange to me.

I've been diagnosed about 3 years ago. Put on 3g mesalazine, flared, got Prednisone for 4 months, flared, got budesonide (Cortiment MMX) for 2 months, flared because of C. Diff, got on Metronidazole and 4 days od Vanco (which you can get only while hospitalized where I'm living), flared thanks to C. Diff again, got put into isolation ward lol while eating Vanco like a boss for 2 weeks, flared, went on Cortiment for 8 months, flared, got mesalazine suppositories which didn't help at all, flared, aaaand this is where I am now, just got prescribed 40mg of Pred for 2 months+mesalazine enemas, all while still taking the tablets which, AFAIK, will never stop. 

As you can probably tell, I'm steroid dependent and mesalazine alone isn't cutting it - the longest remission I've had was the one on Cortiment (loved that thing, no side effects, felt great), all other were 1-2 months at maximum (the periods between taking a drug and the next flare) It's like nothing is working and I'm miserable af, also battling depression, severe anxiety, double vision caused by incurable higher order aberrations, all while dealing with a mother who just became homeless out of her own stupidity. Sigh. 

But! I'm not here to vent but to ask a question. So.

I assume the next route will be the Aza one. If it works - cool. However, seeing as I have such incredible look and there's a big chance it won't, I looked into biologics, which are the last step before a colectomy, right? Turns out, over here, after you pass all the tests and are qualified for a biological treatment, they put you on it for a year at most. If you flare after stopping the infusions, there is a slim chance they'll grant you access to Remicade or Humira (the only two available for UC over here) again, but, and this is my main concern, isn't that... bad? As in, after taking a break, isn't there a high chance of your body developing antibodies? 

This keeps me up at night, haha. I'm 27 and this illness already took so much from me, so instead of weeping, I figured it'd be better to focus on the future. But it's starting to look scarier and scarier as well :(

As soon as I walk into the bathroom, super relieved that I made it in time, I see a giant cockroach crawl across my entire bathroom vanity. The little asshole then planted himself literally 6 inches from the toilet. I assessed the situation and realized I would rather shit myself than sit down next to that monster. So I run downstairs and call my husband for help. He’s trying to finish a story and I say, “I am gonna crap my pants you gotta kill a cockroach NOW!” (I had a bout of c diff recently and we have two kids so I try not to poo anywhere else in the house in case the c diff is back.  In retrospect this would have been a good time to choose a different restroom and just clean it after but my brain was hijacked by my bowels). Anyway, realizing the urgency, husband runs up and attempts to kill cockroach. Of course this resilient m’fer manages to hide from us for the longest 47 ish seconds of my life.  The whole time I am whisper screaming, because sleeping kids, OMG GET HIM I AM GONNA POOP MY PANTS. Poor husband is now trying to locate a hiding cockroach under immense pressure.

Do you ever have those nights where you just lose it and overdo it? :( Last night that’s what I did; I ate taquitos, burritos, cookies, and because I’m on prednisone I didn’t think even that was enough so I made some peanut butter and honey toast too. All with a cup of milk too. I think I got too high or something because I ate all that and fell asleep before I had a chance to take my sulfathalazine and antidepressant (for prednisone) and put my enema in... This morning I’m bleeding again, and honestly these moments are the ones that feel most defeating... I know it’s an example of me not taking good care of myself but sometimes I wish I could just afford a bad day. Anyways, I’m hoping I can recover from this, even though I’m currently tapering off prednisone (thank god because it’s been absolute hell for me). I’m going on remicade soon; I’m just nervous about biologics and nervous nothing will work and ugh, sometimes all this stuff just gets to me.

Everything on the colonscopy looked like UC and it's just that the biopsy didn't confirm it. Also my symptoms historically are more UC but there are a couple that I used to get now and again that seemed a bit more Crohn's related.  

  

Now my current predicament. Starting the end of March I had some awful vomiting virus (suspected to be caused by coronavirus but not tested) and since then (it lasted two weeks) I've had diarrhoea every day, despite sticking to my strict UC zero fibre diet religiously. However now that I think about it more the symptoms aren't the same as UC flareups typically were for me - I am much more frequently having the Crohn's type symptoms compared to the UC ones which is not how it used to be. I don't think it's Crohn's though, because I can feel a lot of spasming in my entire colon, which makes me think it could be post-infectious IBS, if that's even possible when you already have IBD.   

  

So basically I'm wondering what to do with fibre. With UC it's always worked very well for me avoiding fibre, especially as some things (lettuce in particularly) used to go through me, cause a lot of bleeding and come out whole, undigested at the other end. But a lot of the symptoms I'm having now can be caused/exacerbated by lack of fibre...do I risk reintroducing small amounts of veg?",2020-05-02 21:10:17

I was diagnosed with UC back in January of 2020 so I’m still pretty new to this, but, my most recent issue has gotten me a little nervous... my doctor had me on Azathioprine (150mg) and pred (40mg) a day. While I felt like my BMs were getting a little better, the side effects of the Azathioprine were killing me. I was getting terrible burn in my stomach, muscle aches, fatigue, felt like someone was squeezing me while I was using the bathroom but nothing would come out anymore. I called my doc and got bloodwork done because he thought I might be getting pancreatitis and told me stop the Azathioprine. Once I did I noticed a little change in my aches and fatigue. Got the bloodwork back with no issues so I started the Azathioprine again in a 100mg dose taking 1 pill in the am and one at night. The next day I went woke up and was non stop on the toliet, my bms weren’t even close to what they were before and it was a lot. That night fever of 103 chills, aches almost like the flu. Got tested for flu and covid both came back negative. But since this (Tuesday) my BM’s haven’t been the same. Back to all diarrhea, color changes consistently from pale to black. Now floating stool.

I’ve had UC since 2009. UC was like a consolation prize disorder, in that it came to me after I had prevailed over some personal crises. In 2009 I went to rehab and quit the things I was killing myself with - opiates, alcohol, speed, cigarettes. UC symptoms came right after all the withdrawal and detox. 

I couldn’t remove addictive tendencies fully so mainly I just replaced smoking cigarettes with exercising. So I became almost maniacally active - constantly going on hikes or runs. I still do this - minus the runs. I run maybe once a week a few miles these days - gotta save the knees. 

I’m not going to write a sermon or anything, but 2009 to now has been the most productive period of my life. I am utterly grateful that I got UC at a time in my life when I was actively searching for a spiritual means of healing for addiction. I have found that means for myself. Thus, from the get-go UC was squeezed into context for me - pretty big problem, but nothing out of the ordinary as far as life is concerned - and many have gotten over on way worse - I hear their stories all the time.  

Anyway, since getting UC, I have gotten 4 degrees from UGA: BS - Psycholgy, BA - History, MSW, MPH - Gerontology. I got married (and divorced - adjusting well) and had a couple kids. I’m 41 now and my flare ups are way worse. For me, all is not lost no matter how bad, as long as I am able to walk 20,000 steps per day. That is my benchmark.

Hi again

Having posted about undergoing a 5 (actually 6) day FMD during a flare up (see here), there were some replies asking for updates, and seeing as there’s not much else to do at the moment, and that I’ve just completed a second 5 day FMD, I thought now might be a nice time to follow up. 

CURRENT SITUATION:

Since my last post, life has been turned somewhat upside down (as it has for everyone). The long story of it is that I’m writing this from a small apartment in Leeds, in the UK, which I have rented for cash from some guy off the internet, because we were unable to get back to Australia from Colombia because Covid-19. I won’t dwell on that too long, however, because you’re probably here to hear about FMD and UC. 

POST-ROUND 1:

Round 1 feels like an eternity ago, though I do keep a journal, so I have some record of the immediate aftermath of my first FMD. I should say at this point that I am not a doctor, nor a clinical researcher - I performed no randomised control trial on myself, and this post does not constitute advice - it’s just my personal experience. DO NOT TAKE THIS AS ADVICE, IT IS MERELY A PERSONAL ACCOUNT.

My motivation for undergoing the FMD was that I was extremely worried about our upcoming trip to Central and South America. As my wife and I both turned 30 this year, we had been saving for this trip for a long, long time, and had planned to take 6 months off work to travel down the continent, eating, drinking and enjoying ourselves as much as possible. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you how difficult that would have been during a flare up, so it was really important to me to try something to get my symptoms under control. 

Just to recap my symptoms leading into the FMD: very high frequency poops, with blood and mucus present most of the time, combined with intense cramping and a chronic loss of appetite and energy. As I said last time, I do not take medication to treat my disease, and do not have active and ongoing medical care. 

Immediately after the first FMD, the most notable symptom I had was indigestion. After a few days of gallons of soda water and steady omeprazole, that did start to come under control. I mentioned last time, but I think that this may have been due to dehydration, which is not an uncommon result of an FMD. When you consider the amount of fluid that was being expelled in my poop at the time, that would add some further weight to that assumption. 

During and immediately after the FMD, I did notice a reduction in the frequency of poops per day. I should mention that, as helpfully commented by another Redditer, this may well have been due to the fact that there was simply much less food going through my intestine. I feel that this is a good assumption, and I would simply add to that, that whatever the reason for the reduction, it was a great relief to wake up fewer times in the night to go to the bathroom. I also noticed a reduction in the severity of the cramps, again possibly related to my intestines doing less work on less food. 

In terms of the consistency of my poops, they were still definitely at the higher end of the Bristol Stool Scale, though I did start to notice a less blood and mucus over the course of the next few weeks. I should say at this stage that I did not notice an instant, miraculous cure of my flare-up, and I would urge caution to anyone viewing this as a magical cure - please do not set yourself up for disappointment, but instead look for the more nuanced results of your own experience. 

Regarding the re-feed process: I eat a mostly vegan diet, and so it wasn’t difficult for me to follow the directions mentioned by Dr. Longo in his book. I never really eat white carbs, and eat as many vegetables as I can every day. I did notice a change in my body shape - I completed the FMD in January, and still feel much slimmer, with notably less visceral fat. I was a healthy weight to begin with - BMI of ~23.5, waist size 30, though like most people would have preferred to have more tone on my stomach. I’m finding that, following the diet, I’m storing much less fat on my stomach, and have visible abs for the first time since I was 18. This hasn’t coincided with an increase in exercise intensity nor frequency, and I have reverted to the same diet as before the fast. 
In terms of the severity of my UC, other than the slight improvement to my symptoms, I didn’t see a real end to the flare up immediately following the FMD. 

However, about 3 weeks after completing the FMD, my flare up did come to an end. I really would hesitate at this stage to attribute that to the FMD, and I don’t think that a sample size of 1 is worth drawing any conclusions from, as regards treatment of my disease. However however, I was extremely relieved when my symptoms cleared up almost miraculously the day before our trip started, and I am so glad that the adult nappies (diapers) I bought for the trip turned out to be superfluous! 

THOUGHTS ON ROUND 1:

I’ve already discussed this in the first post, but I would strongly reiterate that preparation for the FMD is KEY. 

I’m very happy with the change to my body shape, and my overall ability to resist things like sugar cravings and junk food. I’m now very happy to have been symptom-free for 3 months, and hope that this period will continue indefinitely (doesn’t everyone…)

Doing the FMD has definitely given me a renewed and very profound appreciation of the foods I love. During a flare up, when I have completely lost my appetite, I do often forget the simple joy of delicious food, though the harsh restriction and difficulty of the FMD has meant that my appreciation for things like sourdough bread and fresh vegetables has once more gone through the roof. 

I am still in the situation of having no ongoing, regular medical support with testing and monitoring, so I have no idea what effect the FMD had on my bloods etc. I hope that one day, when my wife and I have stopped traveling, and doctors have a little extra time on their hands, I’ll be able to establish some baselines, and see what clinical results the FMD has actually had on me, but alas that day is far off I fear. 


ROUND 2:

BACKGROUND:

I have just completed my second round of FMD, this time with no active UC flare up. The motivation this time was having just spent a month crashing at a friend’s place, and eating their extremely high fat, high dairy, high carb diet. These are things I am very much not used to, especially having come back from a South American diet of mostly avocados, fruit and arepas, so my wife and I both wanted to try the FMD to see what the results would be like on our bodies. 

I know that this is still an untried world for many people, so I thought that the experience of an FMD, this time without a flare up, might be valuable to anyone considering it. 

THE FMD:

This time I mostly used the meal plan from “FMD Made Easy,” by Igor Klimenkoff, with some minor alterations based on what has been available to purchase during the Coronavirus pandemic. (Klimenkoff’s book is available on Kindle) I made sure to double-check the calories and macros of each meal, and where I did needed to make alterations, I made sure that they were in keeping with the daily targets. 

I am writing on Day 6 (re-feeding day), and I must say that I am super, super glad to have made it! 

My first reaction is that it was much, much harder to stick to the FMD this time around. I think that comes as a combination of having eaten a very rich diet for the past few weeks, in addition to not having any cramps, which would normally suppress my appetite, and did so during the first round. 

I didn’t follow the advice in Dr Longo’s book, which recommends following his “Longevity Diet” for at least a week before the FMD, and I think in hindsight that it would have made things easier had I done so. Jumping straight into the strict discipline required of the FMD was quite challenging, especially as, as I’m sure many people have, I’ve been using food as therapy during the pandemic and lockdown. 

I experienced some of the same symptoms as Round 1: bad breath; chronic thirst; lethargy especially, though this time I was determined not to suffer heartburn as a result of dehydration, and so I drank a LOT of water. I didn’t keep track, but it must have been 2-3 times my usual daily consumption, and I’m someone who tends to drink a lot of water. 

I found that my mental activity and motivation were suppressed during the fast: I am currently studying to become a translator, and my ability to study has been virtually nil this week. This hasn’t really been a problem, however, as there hasn’t been much else going on during lockdown, and the chance to simply sit on the couch and watch TV or read fiction has been quite welcome to be honest. 

The most positive result of this second round so far is how excited I am about healthy food again. My wife and I went to bed last night like children on Christmas Eve - we have been so, so excited by the prospect of waking up and making an oat milk cappuccino and eating muesli. Call me a stupid millennial, but if a bowl of cereal and a coffee can evoke that much joy during a global pandemic and lockdown, then I would recommend it to anyone! 

I have noticed that the visceral fat I gained at my friend’s house has decreased again. I have lost ~1kg, and my BMI is now 20.9. I know that BMI is not a particularly accurate assessment of health, however with no clinical (ie blood etc) results available to me, this is the metric I’ve chosen to think about. 

So that’s it - Round 2 is over, and I’ve got to say I’m pretty glad. Given that I’m now in remission, and eat a healthy diet anyway, I think that I’ll stick to Dr Longo’s once every 6 months approach. Looking to the future, I think I’ll have to find a way to arrange work commitments so that it’s possible to have the whole week of the fast off, as I sincerely doubt that I would be able to get anything done otherwise! 

I hope this has been useful to anyone considering an FMD, and again I AM NOT A DOCTOR. THIS POST DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE. PLEASE DO NOT DO ANYTHING WHICH WOULD LAND YOU IN A HOSPITAL AT THE MOMENT - THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE IDEA.",2020-05-03 12:40:49

Sorry if it gets a bit confusing at times with my rambling but I'll just begin with the start of stuff and go from there. I'm a male and was diagnosed at around age 10 (I'm 27 now) and have been flaring for the past several weeks. It started around Mid-Late March this time. My last flare was literally 2 years ago from this flare. I also had some bad anemia due to blood loss and had my first ever blood transfusion two days before being hospitalized. I was hospitalized for 5 days, starting on April 14th, and was discharged April 19th. My GI initially had me on a gradual Prednisone taper, starting from 40mg and going down to 30mg, then 20mg, etc. When I went down to 30mg my symptoms started coming back, such as increased frequency and blood, pretty fair amount of blood at times or just blood coming out. In the hospital, I think I was on 60mg of Methylprednisolone (might not have spelled that right) for the duration of my stay, as well as 800mg of Mesalimine (Delzicol) for daily doses. I had been on six mercaptopurine (6-MP) ever since I'd been diagnosed, but recently was taken off of it due to negative side effects such as excessive vomiting and nausea during this flare. My previous GI had moved me up to a 150mg dosage per day and it messed me up.  Anyways, my current GI has me on 40mg of Prednisone for the foreseeable future due to my current issues with the taper, and 400mg of Mesalamine (Lialda) for my daily doses. My GI is working on getting me on to Entyvio infusions and hopefully that will help me.

Anyways, on to the school problems. My advisor at my current college says that I am past the point for applying for an incomplete and my only other options at this point are to either dive head first into my schoolwork and potentially ignore my health in order to try and get work done, or to withdraw. I really do not want to withdraw as I had to drop out 2 years ago due to my previous flare and it was very costly for my family and I in regards to money. I'm just trying to figure out what, if any, other options I have here. I already have one course that I applied for an incomplete for a bit ago (think a few weeks) and it was approved at the time. Honestly, I'm in a bit of a panic right now with my flare and being stuck at home and I don't know where else to turn.",2020-05-03 05:49:22

After a few years of struggling on and off, I figured I would finally take some time to write out what I’ve been going through to see if anyone has had any similar experience. I’ll try to keep it brief, but I would appreciate the read. 

Every couple of weeks for the past few years, I’ve been having “episodes” of an origin that I can’t quite place. The worst of which happened about half a year ago while I was on vacation in Colorado and was bad to the point that I nearly took myself to the hospital. The most recent episode was today and has been sticking around for the past month or so. In Colorado, my anxiety progressed to full blown panic attack in the back of an uber with a driver who wouldn’t stop talking about the development of the human brain while I was quietly dying in the back seat. My fingers and toes and face would tingle, I had the cold sweats, shortness of breath - the full gamut. I got home and had a painfully loose bout of diarrhea. 

The symptoms, to me, always seem primarily gastrointestinal with secondary symptoms that spread through my body. Bloating/discomfort spikes during these episodes, and for the week following, the area under my ribcage felt full, as if someone had surgically put a pork tenderloin below my diaphragm. I would be constipated for a couple of days, and then once I finally had a movement, diarrhea would follow immediately afterwards. (TMI warning) It always had a burning sensation, looked like silt, and often had pieces of fibrous vegetables like leafy greens that had been undigested. Sorry for being so blasé about it, but I’m beyond the point of shame. My sinuses would be inflamed, I have chronic shortness of breath/mild asthma, and the back of my tongue would be covered in what I assume is dead skin cells/food/bacteria. During a particularly bad episode a few weeks ago, my tongue had become pale. These were accompanied by a mild headache and worsened tinnitus. 

Occasionally, when I eat acidic foods, I get a pain in my middle back. It’s like a crampy pain, that escalates and then de-escalates in the span of about a minute. I usually use a heat pack to relax the muscles there. Lately, my knees and ribs have been hurting in a way that almost feels arthritic. On the backs of my upper arms, there is a rash (resembling keratosis pilaris) that seems to come and go.

As to my diet: in the past month I’ve cut out dairy, gluten, added sugars, alcohol, coffee, and junk food in general. It has helped to a degree, but I’ve still been feeling inflamed and anxious, also finding it difficult to fall asleep at night without melatonin. Right now I’m taking a multivitamin to make up for any deficits. My doctor has prescribed me with Miralax but I’m not taking it right now thanks to diarrhea. I have also been prescribed Flonase, Cetrizine, and Budesonide but it seems to me like they are treating the symptoms rather than the cause.

I’m really looking for help. I’d like to go to my doctor and be able to ask him to look for something specifically. I’m also looking for anyone with a similar experience who may be able to share some knowledge. Thanks for the read.

1233,Weightlifting with strong case of UC,FullAPSona,3,gde2qs,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/gde2qs/weightlifting_with_strong_case_of_uc/,3,"Hi, Im a semi professional weightlifter/crossfitter (70-80kg with 5-8% fat content, depends a lot on if Im on a flare or not) and Ive had multiple setbacks due to UC flares, often putting me 30% behind my PB in multiple exercises. Im looking for tips on what to do to improve my condition without taking anabolic steroids as that is considered cheating imo. My list of medicines consists of Hurimoz (same as Humira), mezalazine pills both oral and pentasa. On top of that I take painkillers (non NSAID ofc) to deal with pain of flares and muscle ache and headache that happens without even working out. Also prednisolone while on flares.

The supplements I take:
Multivitamins
Fish oil
Creatine
Whey
BCAA

Food:
Lean meat, trying fish but I react badly to over 100g per meal, and high protein/fat foods with low starch and fiber content. Im not a professional chef, and since Im just a student I dont have a lot of time to make interesting meals. Any tips on meals that are nice for people with UC in general (doesnt need to contain x% protein as long as its good for the stomach), would be greatly appreciated :)

I try working out 6x a week, but while on flares that might go down to 0-2x a week with minimal jogging and relatively low weights due to muscle fatigue. Ive been doing everything by the book and went up around 10kg in pure muscle after my initial flare almost in pure muscle (after losing 13kg of 50% muscle 50% fat) and Improving my PB in every exercise by 10-100%. However the prednisolone makes my skin get weak, causing strech marks and also increased muscle ache before and after workout. I found caffeine to be a very good supplement but due to its bad reaction on the stomach and intestines I want to keep that to a minimum.

However despite me getting stronger after a flare, the flare ruins all of that progress and puts me back at the start again. While I know this isnt a terrible workout schedule as 1-2 weeks break/low intensity workout can stimulate growth, I will lose most if not all of the added muscle mass due to not being able to eat enough food to uphold the upkeep calorie intake. Any tips on what I can do to reduce flares and keep the weight loss on a minimum while on periods I dont have the strength to even get out of bed? Id be happy for any sort of input, Im still fairly new to UC and I would love tips and tricks to keep it under control as Ive struggled finding research that is UC specific. Ive been trying to eat things like protein shakes, and Im also thinking of weight gainer shakes as they seem to contain a lot of calories compared to the volume. However with lots of shakes the stomach gets upset and its hard to absorb nutrients when it all washes out of the body in 1-3 hours.

TL;DR
Any foods, workout routines, supplements or things in general I should try out to function better both in controlling UC and for weight lifting. Its hard to deal with 10kg of muscle loss in a few weeks, and then working it back up takes months of hard work and dedication. Any way to keep the appetite up when feeling terrible would be greatly appreciated :)",2020-05-04 17:52:44

I go on prednisone, do well at 20-40mg and then once drop below 20, flare spikes back up and go back to 40 and rinse and repeat.

I’m currently on apriso (mesalamine) and entyvio infusions every 4 weeks.   Recently imuran (azathriprione) has been added but that takes 12 weeks to be effective.

Once under 20mg of prednisone, I begin to experience massive amounts of back pain and spasms.  Long story short, it feels like I have a constant pulled muscle in my back.  Typically on my lower right side is where it will start but then move around my back.

It is very sensitive to touch and sharp movements result in spasms that nearly drop me to the floor (and has literally dropped me to my knees on more than one occasion).  I struggle getting up from any sitting position as it involves back muscles.  Reclining or laying in bed and then trying to get up is incredibly difficult and at high risk of spasms.

My self doctoring says this is enteropathic athritis.  The pain only appears shortly before a flare and during the duration of the flare and when prednisone is not present.

Has anyone else experienced back/joint pain during flares?  How have you addressed it?

Im asking my GI to be put back on prednisone for the next two months to give the imuran a chance to become effective.  Will that help?

She wants to scope again once restrictions are lifted but I’m not sure if there is much info to be gained there.

I don’t know where to start, but here goes: 
I got diagnosed with UC March or May 2018, but I’d had symptom since Dec 2017. Before my symptoms started, I was incredibly focused and studious. I could stick to one task, and see it through. I got really good grades, I slept a normal amount, I was able to workout every day, I didn’t take naps. It was great. 
Reflecting back on the years since my diagnosis, I’ve realized that I’ve become ALOT less focused. Terrible grades, napping a lot, can’t focus on *anything*, my mind wanders a lot more and my vision blurs (but not in a medically concerning way, if that makes sense). 
I’ve just been feeling lost, dazed, confused, etc for the past 2 years. It could most definitely be because I’m not interested in what I do, but I used to be able to focus on things regardless of my interest. I used to be driven and motivated. 
I’ve googled UC and brain fog, and it seems to be common in people with UC and Chrons. 
I got put on prednisone in early March (40mg for 4 weeks, then tapering off at 5mg/week), and for the second or third week of my full dose, I felt like my old self. All my symptoms were gone (TMI: literally the best shits since i developed UC), I was SOOO in result focused, my mind was sharp, I got so much work done! It was fantastic! 
But I went back to the brain fog after that week. 

My questions are: has anyone experienced a decrease in brain fog while on prednisone/Entivyo (my GI recommends I try Entivyo for my next flare)? It seems like my brain fog might be related to active disease....it definitely gets worse when I’m flaring or starting a flare. Is there any way I can get rid of it? 
But my big question is: is anyone with UC have a high stress job? Somewhere that requires 12+ hours of work? I’m thinking of going into consulting and this is one of my biggest concerns. When I’m flaring, I can barely get out of bed. I’m working on creating a routine, so I can fall back on disciple when I have zero motivation or willpower, but I need help getting my mind to focus. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!!",2020-05-05 20:27:01

1242,"Potentially have Colitis, Hoping to Discuss",fancymenofcornwood,6,ge12up,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ge12up/potentially_have_colitis_hoping_to_discuss/,8,"Before I start I know my doctor's input is most important in this situation. I had a tele-health appointment with my GI doctor yesterday. Went over everything and he recommends me getting another colonoscopy once his office reopens. That scoping will be the only thing that can get me some real answers but I'd greatly appreciate the ability to discuss my issues in the mean time.

For background I am 29M. My bowel issues started in earnest around winter of 2015. I was 25 then. It started suddenly, an urge to go the bathroom that resulted in only gas, mucus, and some loose stool with bright red blood. Things calmed down a bit after that first time but within a few weeks they began to flare worse. I would go to the bathroom several times a day only to have gas and mucus come out. My bowel movements still looked ok but their consistency and frequency did change a bit. After a while I began to see more and more bright red blood with the gas and mucus. At night I would feel a sensation of gas moving in my lower bowel along with fluttering/spasming. Obviously this scared the hell out of me. 

I went to my GI doctor and was examined. He mentioned feeling hemorrhoids. Because the symptoms persisted for a few more weeks I was eventually sent for a flex-sig in December of 2015. The prep for the sig caused me to bleed quite a bit. During the scoping the doctor mentioned noticing some inflammation. A tissue sample was taken and biopsied but came back negative for signs of anything odd. The scoping also showed that I had some enlarged internal hemorrhoids. I was essentially cleared after the flex-sig. The bouts of excess gas and mucus lasted for roughly two months before disappearing as quickly as they appeared. For a few months after I saw some intermittent bleeding on my stool but it eventually subsided around March 2016 after I starting using a squatty potty. From here things returned to normal. 

Fast forward to September of last year (2019). And these issues start again very suddenly. I start seeing tons of mucus in my stool and have excess gas. These issues are worst in the morning. I get out of bed and almost immediately have an urge to relieve myself but only gas and mucus comes out. Usually a few hours later I'd have a normalish BM. During the day, especially toward the night, I notice more gas than usual and alot of fluttering/spasming feelings at the end of my colon (near the exit). Some bright red bleed was noticed at this time but not tons. This bout of issues lasted completely through September and then quickly subsided. 

Now, 6 months later, I find myself in a new flare up. Same issues as the last two times. Mucus suddenly appears in my stool and steadily worsens until I have morning urges to relive myself resulting in only gas and mucus. The is more bleeding this time. It is bright red and either mixed in with the mucus or dripped into the toilet. It is a similar amount to what I dealt with in late 2015. Again, after this initial trip I tend to have a roughly normal BM a few hours later. At night I feel the fluttering/spasming again. Like before, if I try to pass gas I feel a burning at the end of my bowels (near the exit) that feels as if I may have an accident. This has gone on for about 2-3 weeks now. I'm using prep-h suppositories to try and sooth down there. 

Adding to all this anxiety is the fact that I've lost a good bit of weight recently, about 15-20 pounds. At around 155lb down from 175 (which was slightly heavy for me). I'll be the first to admit that the COVID-19 situation hit me very hard anxiety wise. I've been a health worrier my whole life and I now have my first child on the way. All these worries stacked up led to some extreme anxiety around early March that led to difficulty eating due to the stress. Couple this with an almost complete change in diet due to starting WFH and being locked down. I also began exercising more in an effort to try and manage my stress. If that lead to the weight loss it backfired spectacularly as it's only led to more stress. 

As I mentioned above, my GI doctor believes it's time for anther scoping. He recommends a colonoscopy but added that his office doesn't expect to begin performing them again until maybe around July. Until then I'm stuck with my own thoughts. If you've read this far then thank you, I appreciate the effort. If anyone of you are interested in weighing in or sharing your experiences I'd greatly appreciate it. Being able to talk though these issues with others would be a great help while I wait for the opportunity to get tested again. 

Thank you.",2020-05-05 18:35:36

Last night I was stressed about a audioconference call I had today so I slept really poorly - around 2 hours. After the conference I was fine, then... Went to the toilets, everything seemed fine until I wiped and saw mucus mixed with blood.

Tried to call both my doc and specialist but both are off to appointments, understandable with the current situation, and wont be availavle until thursday.

I know I still have two pentasa suppositories, i wanted to ask them if I could take them but guess I'll just wait for thursday and see how it goes until then.

And I really think that at the moment the problem isn't actually in my left colon where I have the UC, it seems to me that food is being rushed through start to finish, as its the transverse colon that's having the most cramping (in all past flareups it's been the descending colon)

I was diagnosed with UC in september 2019 and the GI gave me Salofalk (Mesalazin) and Prednisolon (60 mg) and i was felt fine two days later. No blood,  no pain and normal shit after a 10 week horror flare. After tapering off very slowly the flare came back within 2 - 3 weeks but wasnt as bad as before. And after 4 more weeks i took Prednisolon again (30 mg) and was fine again after just two days. Now im 6 weeks without Prednisolon and just Salofalk on maximum and i am in a mild flare again.

So i think i have to go to my GI and that this means Azathriopin. Somehow i am scared of sideeffects and so i thought i could ask my fellow UC - people what their experiences with Aza was like. 

And since Aza needs months to work and i am still flaring: how dangerous is it to take Prednisolon one more time after i took it so much this year?

So in a nutshell I was diagnosed this year after two colonoscopies and an endoscopy within a four month span with moderate ulcerative pancolitis and possibly eosinophilic esophagitis. GI Put me on budesonide first then mesalamine about a month later. The budesonide helped a little on its own but it wasn’t until the mesalamine was added that I got noticeable relief. I knew budesonide was a steroid so I expected my GI to take me off of it after a while (I’ve been on it for almost 4 months now). Well I talked to him last week and he said because of the formulation it doesn’t act like a systemic steroid in most people so he was going to keep me on it. Thing is I have experienced side effects like that of a systemic steroid (bruising all over, acne). I’m not sure what to think about this. I know that steroids aren’t good long term and it’s kind of making me nervous. I’m not a very severe case, no complications. Anyone have any experience with this or insight?

And then I got a hemorrhoid. Finally about a week later. 5-7 days. My stool began to return to normal. I never had pain or lost appetite, just diarrhea and rectal pain from the hemorrhoid. 

In summer 2018 I went to my GP and a GI 3 times. The GP said hemorrhoids. The GI did a visual look with their finger and there was no rectal bleeding. Wasn’t a scope just their hand. I was relieved to hear this but then my symptoms popped up a bit winter 2019 but didn’t lead to missed school. Then a bit during July 2019 but didn’t lead to missed school.

What is the dose that people have been given to recover from a sever flare?

They only gave him 40mg a week tapered down for 4 weeks and it wasn’t enough. He is on week 3. 20mg/day. I just don’t have the experience to advocate.

Since my symptoms went away, my doc took me off of xeljanz.

Right now, I'm trying to get back into a somewhat normal routine because I was pretty bedridden for most of last year.  Exercise was something I easily put into my weekly routine before I got sick.  I don't know if my muscles atrophied or something, but even doing light exercise makes me feel extremely weak afterwards.  And it's *every time* I try to exercise.  Or do any sort of activity that requires moving or using my body.  Even after driving, I feel like I need to slump into bed.  Did a year of flare up just damage my body so badly that I have to be more patient with recovering?  

Has anyone here found a way to combat fatigue after getting back into remission?",2020-05-07 22:18:49

Not to mention that mesalamine is just an anti inflammatory with a special coating or in an enema solution, similar flavors of that shit have been around since forever (Hell even JFK was on something similar). 

Not to mention more than half the doctors pretend to go deaf dumb and blind when you ask about any study or evidence supporting cheap(er) treatment like probiotics, fish oil, vitamins, specific foods ,etc.

It really feels like we have the ultimate ""lets fleece the patient forever disease"" and pharma and the specialists doctors exploit it.

Was hospitalized a week ago and was diagnosed with a moderate-severe case of UC.

For 3 days now, I’m being given 40mg prednisone and 4g of Pentasa (2g in the morning and 2g in the evening).

The medication has been helping and I don’t really have much urgency but my BMs look... weird. They’re very soft and coated in blood still. Will that blood go away eventually? When can I expect it to go away?

I’m also worried that prednisone is more of a band-aid fix because as I understand it, prednisone is not a long term drug. Prednisone has given me dramatic relief but I’m worried that I’ll be back to my normal symptoms when I get off it. Is that the case?

Also, I know that I do still wake up in the middle of the night with some cramping and a bout of blood and diarrhea. That’s about 16 hours after my prednisone dose in the morning. Does that mean the prednisone isn’t strong enough? Or does that mean there hasn’t been enough time for my colon to heal with the prednisone and pentasa?
My doctor told me to hold on for a couple more days and see if it gets better.

Thanks",2020-05-07 02:10:29

I worked out enough to have an average amount of muscle. But I’m concerned that since I’ve started immuran and remicade my legs and arms are smaller than they were in highschool. 

I haven’t been trying to bulk the past 6 months because I’ve been tryin new medicines and was coming out of a hospital inducing flare that made me leave college. So I’ve basically been doing no physical activity for like 6 months. I gained a bunch of fat on prednisone but now that I’m off of it it’s all kind of going away and leaving me with nothing. 

I am healthy enough now that I want to start working out again and building size. But is it even worth it? Will I be able to gain weight on immuran? 

Also if anybody has diets or protein shake types or anything like that that helped them gain weight WITHOUT triggering a flare please let me know thanks!",2020-05-07 02:07:48

My husband has been in a flare for nearly 6 weeks now. We’ve had one video conference with his doctor on week 2 and haven’t even been able to get another. Like they aren’t making appointments. They finally got him in yesterday for a colonoscopy after increasing mesalamine, round of antibiotics and steroids didn’t do a thing. I wasn’t allowed to go in, totally understandable so my husband tells me that he is supposed to talk to the doctor today. I am a preemptive person and also they historically have been bad about call backs when they say they will. Anyway, called his office and the nurses are in high gatekeeper mode. Whatever. I do get to speak with the doctors nurse who leads with “I’m really busy, how can I help you” she’s normally really nice so I’m guessing it’s a hard day/week. So I explain what she already knows and she thinks I am wanting his pathology results 1 day after. I assure her that isn’t  why I’m calling because I am well aware those will take a week. I’m just calling to find out what we are supposed to do in the meantime. Have I mentioned we haven’t gotten to speak to his doctor in a month. Only nurses. She basically tells me “ I don’t know but if you’re that concerned then you should just take him to the ER”.  

I guess what gets me is that all I’ve heard is to avoid the ER as much as possible and to call your doctor, call your doctor, call your doctor. So that’s what we are doing. Every week. Why haven’t we been able to speak to his doctor? I should also mention his doctor isn’t even the one who did his colonoscopy yesterday. It was another in the group which is fine but normally you would have a follow up conversation. 

Maybe I’m just fucking tired and overwhelmed and emotional. I kept my cool through the phone conversation but told her I expected to hear back from their office on whether we needed to increase his steroids or what for the next week. 

I’ve been a wreck ever since. At what point do you say fuck it and go to the ER? At what point do you expect your doctor to advise their patient on that? This isn’t completely new territory this particular flare is though because it means new medication and new levels of understanding and we don’t know what to expect at all! It’s so frustrating that the people with that information won’t talk to us about what we need to know. It is so draining to have to switch into the mode of being the person that demands answers. I hate doing that so much! It sucks the life out of me. My poor husband needs all of me and I need all of my energy to care for him, our kids and our business! 

Maybe this is just me having meltdown about all of it. Thanks for reading and thank you so much to everyone on this page who has been so kind and uplifting! I appreciate you all so much!!


Update: My husbands doctor called back today after his colonoscopy yesterday. He upped his steroid to 50mg a day until he’s under control. Thank goodness! He has to get some blood work done this coming week and then they will let him know when to come in for his first Remicade infusion. Why they didn’t draw blood while they had him is a question but oh well. Hopefully he will get his first infusion later next week. So thankful for all the support you all have given!

place I can come and say what I need to say and not receive just straight pity and questions I don’t feel like answering. You all are amazing!",2020-05-08 19:26:42

So january i start my first ( looking back on it ive defo had other smaller flairups when i was younger but they resolved on their own after awhile) ever big flair up (i feel soooo special my body really shouldn't have) and it was real bad i think i blocked out most of that month but basically i lost 20+ pounds in a month had severe anemia (got to a homogloben of 6 if i remember right) and on top of it i also had the flu while dealing with the intense stomach pain and cramps. There was blood the whole works. Anywho i go to a docs office (i didnt have a regular doc at the time cause of moving at the end of 2019 and on top of it all when i turned 20 i lost some insurance stuff its resolved now but for awhile me and my mom were panicking cause it was a mess). 

A nice British lady told me that i looked close to death so we went to the nearest hospital ER, i ended up getting transfered to a dif hospital down south and i learned im allergic to morphine. So i was on a lot of dolltyl (idk how to spell that) for pain. I got a blood transfusion to which was neat. 

I went on a high dose of prednisone and as i tapered the symptoms returned. Febuary was a rinse and repeat of january except we traveled north do a dif hospital. And i was given less pain meds. I finally got a colonoscopy and a diagnoses. 

Severe pan ulcerative colitis. 

 Idk how bad exactly but needless to say my docs made some faces and its p clear to me that i almost died. 

I was on 80 prednisone and mesalamine. (I was so hungry all the time y'all ) anyways some stuff happened (symptoms threatening their return) i got humira first starter kit injection seemed to help alot.  Like pain desolved in the first thirty minutes kinda help. Then the symptoms started up again ( by this time my gi at the time had me lowering my prednisone by increments of 5) i was glad to finally make process. But i still had to change GIs (the guy i had at the time was phasing out my insurance).  But as ive taken more humira i haven't noticed any more progress. In fact when I got down to 35 after being stuck on 40 for awhile i had the diarriah return.

Im now stuck at 40 and the pain has returned, bentyl helps with the spasming pain but its not getting the sharp left oriented pain thats started to return. I even took my latest dose of humira wednesday and yet i still have symptoms rolling in. The diarrhea isnt staying consistently and I'm actually lowkey constipated rn. 

Im going in for another colonoscopy in the 15th but idk it feels like i should've at least stayed at the weird ""not great but better than dying from blood loss"" stage id sorta gotten too.  My emotions are a mess, my skin is all sorts if broken out and my face is so round sports stadiums could toss it like a beach ball. Im miserable, i cant do anything and i feel like a massive burden on my family my anxiety and depresion are teaming up against me (honestly this is one group project i want there to be slackers on) and idk what to expect anymore.

My food is as basic as it can get the plainest of chicken, the most thoroughly cooked ground beef, the blandest amd most underseasoned meals known to man. Ive cut out milk and cheese and yogurt. The house was already mostly gluten free cause of my mom and when i do have fruit its been blended in a fruit shake with only soy milk/ vanilla ensures.  I cant even eat vegetables.

I miss eating food but i also gained like 25+ pounds in the last month and im starting to fear eating again cause my stomach just does not Like It. 

My new GI is cool ive only interacred with him via video chat and he was the saint that gave me bentyl after the last one told me to ""just stay on 40 prednisone it'll fix itself"" (note at that time I'd been on 40 for two weeks and was really just starting to feel its worst effects)

But my gi mentioned last voice chat that humira was a weird choice for my case and that it only works 30% of the time for cases as bad as mine.  We ended up traveling two hours to his office for an apointment and holy cow i hated the whole experience. I felt like a rock in a tumble machiene the whole rode there every pot hole seemed to jostle my stomach like a kid with a soda bottle.

I did not see my GI that day he was in the hospital next door. That cool whatever man has a job and one whiney twenty year old isnt the biggest priority. So i saw the other GI at that location. And basically she made me feel like i was imagining my symptoms coming back.  She said that stepping down from 40 to 35 is ""chemically no different"" and that bassically it was my fault for being too stressed and thats what made my symptoms worse.  She also was confused and exasperated when i said i hated prednisone it was a ""gah really just suck it up"" kinda deal from her she basically said that it was better than the alternative.  At least when i was in the hospital I was high enough that the world became google maps.

Which first off, no? I wanted it to work out so bad i was excited i hate being on prednisone the only thing i like about it is it darkened the peach fuzz on my upper lip so i can almost convince myself that im on T (im a trans guy and lemme tell ya this is a weird first year to be out in).  

She did a whole stomach patt down thing and while uncomfortable it wasnt ridiculously painful (but im pretty sure thats just cause i had just taken 2 bentyl  before we'd left i was falling asleep in appointment ) she then told me that because i wasnt crying out in pain that im fine really and i need to give humira more time.

And i get it i was at 3 injections at the time (again i just had my fourth shot on Wednesday) but like i shouldn't be getting worse should I?  I had diarrhea the night after injection 4. I had to cut out more food than before (rip onions i will miss the smidgen of flavour ypu gave me) I had the sharp left sided pain return a day ago, and again bentyl isnt solving that, its helping me manage the other pain but its not doing anything for that pain.  Honestly idk what to think anymore.

Is this normal? Should my symptoms be yoyoing this much? What am i doing wrong food wise? I have a food tracker and everything and i cant tell whats making me react like this.  Does anyone who had a simularly bad case have any tips and insights? Is this something i just have to tough out? Should i just take all the bad prednisone side effects with a smile? Like idk what to do.  (Also does anyone have any tips for the shear massive amounts of fat that seems to only pool around my neck and face? I know its not the biggest concern but bullfrogs have thinner faces than i do rn and lemme tell ya its really a blow to the ego to see my own face rn).  And should i be concerned by the fact that my legs and stomach are all stretchmarks now?  Is the tenderness of the marks normal?

Honestly im just very confused my actual GI said that we should be able to tell soon of itll actually help but the other GI (the lady that massaged my stomach like an angry cat) said that we have no way of knowing untill more time has passed. Are there any things that i should be asking my GI? Is there anything i could do to help? Or am i stuck waiting?

I have another virtual appointment on the 12th with the GI but idk if i should wait that long. I need all the help i can get really so any suggestions would be great.",2020-05-08 10:30:22

So I’m on leave for school right now and I was just informed that if campus reopens for a summer semester I can’t go back and that’s a bummer but it is what it is.

The scary part about that is since I’m newly diagnosed and just starting these meds I have like no immune system. Basically my doctor said if I get COVID-19 I’ll most likely end up on a ventilator. Lovely. I feel like I should clarify that I’m also 18 and all this terrifies me.

It also drives me insane knowing that I’ll probably be stuck in my house longer than everyone else as this keeps going on. I’ve only left the house to get blood work done since March. I feel like it’s Groundhog Day and that I’m going absolutely insane.

My mom is also my rock during all this but she’s an essential worker and is around the public all day so I can’t hug her or be around her that much. Sometimes I just lay at the end of her bed while she reads and I’m scared that even that’s too close? It just really sucks I really just need a hug from my mom.

Diagnosed back in January with mild left sided uc, had been going on for a few months. About 2 weeks ago I got extremely sick. Fever of 103, uncontrollable shakes, floating bms (never happened before), worst migraines ever and stomach cramps I can’t imagine to have again. Went to the doctor and got checked for flu and covid both came back negative. Ever since that day I have had extremely terrible symptoms but don’t know if it’s the uc or a combo with something else. Before I may have gone 10x a day since then I can look at my food and have to go. Go about 20-30 times a day and 10-15 times a night. I feel like I might have gotten an infection? Only thing I was taking was prednisone. I have an mre on Friday and bloodwork and stool samples should be in tomm. I’m about 3 months from being a first time dad and about to be on short term disability. 
Am I overthinking it could be something else? Are these symptoms of severe uc (what my new dr thinks I have over video chat). Urgency I’m used to, but the cramping is new and seems to be in my lower abdomen.
Edit: I’ve been on a chicken noodle, applesauce, avocado, scrambled egg, salmon diet for two weeks with little to no blood. But the bms go from diarrhea to floating pieces constantly and also a lot of foam which I saw for ibs a lot.",2020-05-11 00:19:16

I was medication free for about a year from 2015-mid 2016 (I was living abroad at the time, taking Imuran, and was getting regular upper respiratory things, was hospitalized for pretty bad mycoplasma pneumonia, and a year later was hospitalized with a ""mono-like virus"" and was basically off my meds so my immune system could recover.  My disease has been mildly active since. I'm on Entyvio monthly which I feel like is just keeping things at bay. When I eat aggravating foods, I usually have streaks of blood and mucus. I've just come off a course of antibiotics and it destroyed me. I contacted my Dr to ask what probiotics he recommends so I could replenish what was lost. I already read on here and online about wheatgrass juice having a great benefit, backed by studies. So on Wednesday, I went off to the health food store and bought BioK and wheatgrass juice powder. My boyfriend is getting back into Keto now that he's been furloughed due to COVID and I'm going to restrict my diet as well. I also take weed edibles a few times a week. I started the probiotics and wheatgrass on Thursday and this morning I had a blood and mucus free very long snakey BM! And I had potato chips yesterday (which are usually a killer for me - last bag in the apartment lol) and a gin cocktail and still had the healthiest BM I've had in a while.

If you've had mild active disease that your treatment is just keeping you at bay from a flare, I would definitely recommend looking into natural and homeopathic supplements. So far this is looking like a game changer for me. I feel less fatigued too and I feel less bloated.",2020-05-10 17:20:42

I recently started taking medication after doctor’s recommendation and I have been taking 4800mg of Asacol (mesalamine) delayed-release tablets daily for the past months.

Around the same time as starting my medication I also changed my diet to eat more healthily, I have cut out gluten, wheat, and eat only very plain simple foods, white rice, squash, plain chicken etc.

I have noticed a slight reduction in the amount of blood that I am passing when going to the toilet, and I also have noticed a reduction in the amount of mucus produced by my body. There has also been a reduction in the frequency/intensity of stomach cramps that I experience throughout the day. That being said, I am still bleeding during bowl movements. I am not passing the tablets out whole during bowel movements as some people have reported online with these tablets, so I am under the impression that the medication is at least entering my body.

I am unable to tell if the improvements mentioned above are all to do with my improved diet or whether the medication is working. If Mesalamine was working on my body, after 1 month of taking 4800mg daily should I still be expecting to bleed. The initial course proscribed by my doctor was 3 months’ worth of medication. Should I look at alternative medications with my doctor, or stick it out for 2 more months?

So I've been suffering with uc for about 3 years now and have been pushed through the system all the way up to vedolizimab infusions.

I tried all the herbal remedies and smoothie diets and ate shit loads of pro&pre biotics till I felt sick.

I couldn't help but think that this disease was something more than physical for me. So I decided to do something radical and have a psilocybin (magic mushroom) ceremony with my girlfriend trip sitting me with the intention to:

""Identity the source of the disease and to discover the healing potential within myself to break free from its restrictions""

The results where vivid and extremely coherent.
The basis of the experience took me back to my parents divorce and allowed me travel back to that part of me that had suppressed his emotions and Express them all.
(Its was intensely emotional but I created a space where I felt safe enough to be vulnerable)

Working alongside my therapist we were able to interpret and integrate the experience together.

Ever since I've felt less stressed about my disease with this deep knowing that it will all be okay and my condition will improve.

My symptoms are lessening every day. I drank coffee today for the first time in 6 months WITHOUT BLOOD OR INFLAMMATION! 

That's a huge win for me!

Hope this was a worthy read

The next week, despite daily increasing cases, they throw it out the window and lift almost all restrictions, other than church and mass gatherings. So if my state is no longer following the phased approach and not making sense in their judgement of lifting restrictions how am I supposed to justify my doctor saying phase 3.

Gosh this sounds bad but I promise it's relevant.. generally found to be somewhat attractive) approached me. He literally got to within 3 feel of me. I wasn't looking at him, but felt his presence so I looked up and he proceeds to say 'oh good thing you're all bundled up, seeing as it's so cold outside' with an absolutely disrespectful and sarcastic tone, and then also proceeded to point at my mask and gloves. I was stunned. Again, he appeared to be in his 60s and had ZERO ppe. Now, I'm relatively short, but I felt comfortable that if needed I could kick his ass, but I do not get into confrontations. Ever. 


Well I guess I've got zero fucks left bc I swear to God, I let him have it the best I could. I actually stood up for myself! I was like, dude, do you not know what's going on? You should also have some protective gear on. Then he kept going at me and I kinda blacked out a bit lol but I remember he ASKED ME IF I TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONA!!!! you guys!! I was fuming, and said no actually I have an autoimmune disease and am immunocompromised, so ignorant people like you could kill me if you gave it to me. He still kept going, so i did too, and ended it with a 'do better man. Quit being ignorant you fucking idiot' and walked away. 

I'm still totally shocked that someone would openly judge another person for trying to protect themselves. You have NO IDEA what someone is going through. Also, you have no idea who you are talking to. I would never do anything crazy (this was crazy enough) but here in AZ you will get shot for less. But I'm glad I stood up for myself and maybe taught that prick to shut his mouth. 

Sorry for the rant, but I thought you all would understand out of everyone since we are all in this together and UC can absolutely fuck off. I HATE PEOPLE SOMETIMES!!!! And I hate Remicade.",2020-05-12 05:34:07

I just spoke with my specialist and he has prescribed Cortiment Steroids to try to battle the inflammation. Just wondering if anyone has had any experience with this steroid, what should I expect, is it similar to Prednisone? I remember feeling great while taking the higher dose of Prednisone but as the dose came down I began to feel much more lethargic.

I have had UC now going on 10years. Took a while to get diagnosed, Dr just assumed it was something caused by a bad takeaway which makes no sense as it lasted months. It was of course during my first flare up, the 30 visits to the loo and half that just pass blood.

Had two scopes and diagnosed and put on 1g Pentasa.

Not had a flare up since, but was in pain everyday particularly in the last job I was doing, it was stressful. I had other severe mental health issues at the time and considered taking my own life but for the time ever I took a step back. I handed in my notice and booked my first holiday in almost 15yrs. 3 months travelling across America with 10 strangers. I was scared of things happening, if I would flare up as that would ruin the trip as couldn't exactly ask for the van to pull over all the time etc.

The first day there was amazing, landed in Miami, met with everyone and we got down to Key West. Spent the evening watching the sunset with my feet in the ocean, it just felt as if all my stress just went away with each wave. I had about 3 gotta go moments the entire trip, and all were due to eating something my stomach doesn't agree with.Thankfully no incidents.

Ever since coming back, I saw how stress really made a difference so tried my best to avoid it but pressure was on to get a job but I concentrated more on my mental health and even though it took 2yrs, got diagnosed with autism.

I also found going vegan helped me a lot. I get no stomach pains, did get some pain the last month but had no meds for almost 3 weeks due to this virus.

Anyway onto the main bit of my post. Motivation.. I don't know if anyone else has this issue but as soon as I feel productive, like I'm about to start something, whether it be starting to write a new idea, start editing something, making a new quiz, just anything that means doing some work, my UC is like hold on, you gotta go poo and sit there and think about why you're here. Its annoying as hell, I don't get it. I'm not lazy, I like to get stuff done but even writing this now, I can almost feel an urge to get me to go. Does anyone know why this happens and how to stop it or avoid it?",2020-05-13 14:25:50

I’ve been tapering off my prednisone, which I thought put me in a pretty good remission-ish(??) state, and I was also given enemas to help as well. I think they were working at first but I stopped doing them for a while because they gave me really bad gas when I go to bed and when I wake up it’s usually pretty painful. And yes, I do squeeze the extra air out before doing the deed. Last night I thought I might as well try it again, because maybe they would start to help again, but today’s been kinda more questionable when it comes to BMs, so I’m wondering if anyone else has had experiences with enemas not working or making things worse? Should I keep trying to do them, or should I stop? My doctor said it was mostly only for the urgency I was feeling, and the urgency has stopped, so I’m sure it wouldn’t kill me if I stopped doing them entirely, but I’m not sure if I should just keep trying.

&#x200B;

But then 2 weeks ago i got diagnosed with UC and put on entocort (budesonide) and a salofalk (mesalamine) suppository. Things remained unchanged for those 2 weeks, I did feel better but it wasn't any different then how I felt before going on the meds. However, since monday, my symptoms have been starting to come back; much more blood when I go to the bathroom (probably like a tbsp), much more pain/bloating, and I cant trust my farts (although I can generally hold them in so I still keep bowel movements to under 3 a day). And to make matters worse, I literally talked to my doctor Monday and told him I was feeling better so he prescribed me oral pentasa and a 3 month follow up.

&#x200B;

So what gives, do I need stronger meds? Should I call my doc back and tell him things are getting worse? Or should I try the pentasa first and give it a few weeks? Sorry for the long post im just looking for some wisdom as Im new to this stupid fucking disease.

So I'm super anxious to say it in fear of instant bad karma or some kind of trick that'll be pulled on me by life, but after almost a year of flare-up symptoms I feel like I might be finally getting into remission??

I've been having a shitty (no pun intended) flare-up since like, June/July of last year and only recently (just this last Feb) did I get diagnosed with a case of Ulcerative Proctitis. Doc put me on generic Lialda pills as well as mesalamine enemas every night for at least three months.

I know three months in retrospect really isn't that long, but given this COVID-19 stuff every day has really been stretched out lol. So I feel like I've been doing these enemas since forever.

Now for the longest time I was suspecting that maybe I had an intolerance to mesalamine as some of my symptoms seemed to get worse when taking it. Beforehand I was suffering with horrible cramping and constipation, along with occasional heartburn and stomach pain, and I had blood and mucus in my stool. After I started taking my meds the cramping, blood and mucus went away, but my bms became permanently soft and went from 0-1 a day to 3-5 times a day. Heartburn got so bad that I was downing antacid daily multiple times trying to make it go away. Only reason I kept holding out on contacting my doctor was the fact that my mucus and blood went away, which I thought had to mean that the medication was doing something good.

After a little over a month and a half of being on my meds, it seems like finally, FINALLY I'm starting to feel better. It feels like there's a light at the end of the tunnel. This entire past week I've felt great; had only one BM daily, very little heartburn, stools are becoming more solid.

Question for yall is this: how long does it take for you guys to start actually feeling better? Is a month and a half the usual time to start getting real results? 

I'm just hoping that this is real remission and not just a good week that'll come crashing down afterwords 😭🤞",2020-05-15 07:22:26

Fries
Anything overly bready or breaded
Greasy things
Beans (refried beans seem fine tho except for gas PHEW)
Dry processed foods (we're not gonna talk about the constipation I got eating and entire bag of gold fish lord jesus) 

Little lifesavers for me have been popsicles and hersheys kisses. Whenever I get a sweet tooth I have either a popsicle or a few kisses and theyre small amd low residue enough not to cause any problems! I just thought id share all this in case it can help someone else!! Thanks for your time!",2020-05-16 17:29:19

Finally sorted out and got back on insurance in February. Hadn't had a chance to schedule an appointment with my GI due to COVID yet, so I've just been off the meds since November, and everything has been smooth.

Fast forward to now and this week I've experienced some mild symptoms: bloating/cramping, couple wet and mucus-y farts, mucus-y stool, blood in stool maybe twice, now I've got the uncomfortable colon feeling again, like I haven't emptied enough. No real pain, but a bit of discomfort, and more mucus than anything.

The symptoms seem to be very infrequent, at some parts of the day I feel completely normal for a bit, and then it'll come on later and I'll feel a little crampy. Is it time to call the doctor or is this something that will likely pass?",2020-05-16 11:27:21

I’ve had 3 colonoscopies verifying diagnosis. First 2 years was on mesalamine with prednisone to cover flares. On Humira and Azathioprine since December. Also on Xolair for heat related hives that showed up 4 months after diagnosis. 

Before switching to Humira I had to get all vaccinations (7-8 total) like Shingrix and Hep which require live viruses. I got them all before I started Humira. Just got the booster Hep and Shingrix - and I feel horrible. Achy. Regular side effects. 

Also just had a colonoscopy and I’m in remission. Yay!!!

But here is my question: I’m overweight. I’ve never lost weight with my UC except when I was diagnosed. I’ve spent months trying to count calories and be more active. I’ve also been on prednisone for about 1.5 of the last 2+ years. 

I’ve also tried the diets like just eating broth (honestly I’m absolutely nauseous with the smell of chicken broth now). 

My current thinking is I love swimming so when our rec center re-opens I’ll start going in the morning and swimming for an hour. 

Reading all the posts here it seems like most everyone has lost weight with their UC. Obviously I don’t want to lose weight that way.

I was diagnosed at 18 (currently 33). I moved to a different state which caused me to change many habits around food and also removing myself from toxic relationships. I was terrible at taking 6 pills 3xday that I stopped. I worked with a Tibetan doctor for several years and had success cleaning up acne, inflammation and even started to have totally solid, make you Mom proud kind of poops! I felt as though I was truly healing.

At 32 I got a sinus infection, took antibiotics which resulted in c diff. It was awful and all my progress felt lost. Almost a year and a half later, things are getting better and I continue to manage without medication. 

Some things I have done or tried which have seemed successful are probiotic enemas, acupuncture, tibetan medicine or Chinese medicine, yoga therapy, somatic experiencing.

Most nervous system regulation practices have helped to regulate my digestion. A lot of growing up was in a disregulated nervous system state and my digestion issues started around 10 years old. 

Also have looked into the metaphysical aspects of UC and is not surprising correlated with inability or trouble ""letting go"". Something I struggle with big time (anxious attached relationship style). 

Curious for any and all ideas outside of the box of prescription medication. I am not putting it down, it helps people I know that. Just want to see what everyone else may have found or has experienced in their own journey to health on this path.

There’s some places that are window service places (like a coffee shop that only serves at the door and the only people inside are the employees), which seem safe enough but I keep seeing people say if you get covid on prednisone you really could die? I don’t know, I want to get a job really bad, but I just don’t know if it’s worth the risk. Does anyone have any stats on how risky this would be? Should I just take it easy for now and wait till I can get one? I’m in remission by the way (I think... maybe that will be another post because honestly I don’t know what remission looks like.)

This flare is a fraction of how bad my first one was but I'm still concerned of course. I've been taking mesalamine since being diagnosed and my inflammation was treated with 60mg of Prednisone which I tapered off by last July.

So far my only symptoms are loose stool and some abdominal tenderness, no bleeding, no noteworthy amount of mucous and I go to the bathroom like 3-4 times a day but there's no urgency. This has been the case for 5 days but it all started with feeling bloated/gassy/tender abdomen last week for about 3 days. For the past 5 days I've modified/reduced my food intake, all my food is essentially beige and bland now.

Is this flare similar to anything anyone has experienced and gotten over successfully on their own? How long did it last for you and what did you do to help it?

Side note: I have 55 prednisone pills left over from my flare last spring, enough to start at 30-20mg and taper off. I'm not opposed to taking them again if necessary to get out of this flare if it's not a horrible idea-- but I'd rather not for many reasons.

&#x200B;

\*UPDATE\*   
I was able to see my GP Monday (I don't know why that didn't even strike me as an option 2 days ago, I can usually get in pretty quick) because the abdominal pain and other symptoms were getting pretty bad by Monday morning. She prescribed 20MG of Prednisone to take for the next 7 days (up to 10 on the long side if I'm feeling close to being better but just not quite there yet). No need to taper for that short of a period. ",2020-05-17 17:35:55

However, in 2018 I started to experience very weird symptoms like shortness of breath, feeling tired, heart palpitations and tingling hands. After a blood test I was diagnosed with a severe vitamin B12 deficiency.

I spoke to my doctor about this, and she says that a B12 deficiency due to malabsorption is not uncommon in UC patients, however it is more frequently seen in patients with Crohns Disease.

After the diagnosis I got 10 B12 injections over a couple of weeks and I quickly recovered. Since then I take B12 (methylcobalamin) pills that are sold at regular drugstores. I’m fine as long as I take these meds, but when I quit I notice that the symptoms mentioned above quickly return.

I was diagnosed in 2017 and it has gotten progressively worse. I started on lyialda, then switched to budesonide and have been on humira since August of this year. I continue to flare weekly, it’s ruining my life. I’m on a constant prednisone taper, on and off and nothing helps. I’m so depressed, have no energy and am struggling just to function enough to work every day.
My GI doctor is in the process of switching me to Entyvio infusions which will hopefully start next week because honestly my quality of life is so low I don’t know what to do. I’m in constant pain and it usually takes about 4-5 hours every morning before I feel semi functionable. After waking up in pain and having to run to the bathroom immediately, I can’t even sleep in if I wanted to on the weekends. I have a normal but very stressful 9-5ish job.
It’s really hard to explain the profound impact this has had on every aspect of my life. People just don’t understand what it’s like to live with this condition.
My question that’s extremely personal is for everyone but males in particular. My sex drive is extremely low and I’m having trouble maintaining an erection and orgasiming. 
I’m lucky that I have an understanding partner. But my sex life is being destroyed. I want to know if anyone else has experienced this? Or anything similar? If it’s related to the medication? Are their supplements I can take to increase sex drive?
I’ve also been under extreme stress over the past month and it’s wearing on all aspects of my life but this question is specifically about sex. 
I’ve read that testosterone supplements are not good. 
Has anyone experienced similar experiences and does anyone have any suggestions to help?
I’m thinking this is a result of being under major stress and flaring basically every other week. I’m just so frustrated with my quality of life and have never had sexual issues before. 
Sometimes this condition just makes me feel like I wanna give up on everything and now the added stress of the sexual problems is making me even more depressed and not wanting to participate in life.
Thanks for any advice or suggestions, if you have any questions lmk and I’ll respond. Thanks again

Edit: I wanted to add that this situation has made me afraid to eat. I’ve lost a lot of weight and am very thin. I can’t afford to lose any more.

My doctor also doesn’t give me much information at all, it feels like a counselling session when I tell her all my problems and she just nods and says “mm that’s hard isn’t it”-_-

 I just wanted to ask you all a few questions so I could get an idea of how you guys have handled your illness and if you have any advice. Im in my late 20s and I got diagnosed with mild UC in Aug last year ( I had been sick about 4 months + prior with it but was so busy I didn’t think it was that serious) and since then till now I’ve been so sick. Some days I’m OK (my ok is I actually make it to the toilet in the morning (YAY) and don’t go from 7am-12 pm in utter pain unable to be productive) but those days are rare. I’m on asacol/ mesalazine( oral and suppositories). 
I guess my questions are (and I really appreciate any advice and i understand everyone’s different)

-How long do your flares usually last?

-How long is too long in a flare before you should get worried and maybe start thinking of new medication?

-Are there any weird foods that make you flare up you’ve found other than the classic “diary, caffeine and alcohol etc”? 

-Do you get super tired from your medication? Or have any bad side effects?

-When we’re talking blood in a flare right, are we talking a little amount on the toilet paper or loads? Cause recently I’ve been having quite a bit and it really freaks me out. Should I be worried by bits that actually look like clots? 

-Do you get a lot of weird gas? Like there’s no way my farts are anything like what they use to be (lol and god I wish they were) they honestly scare the hell out of me now. It was getting to the point where sometimes they hurt quite bad, I’d get this sharp pain for 4 seconds and uncontrollably fart. I give my boyfriend this look of absolute horror when I do them too. I can’t help but laugh after but in the moment they’re really painful.

-also are there any nifty tricks you’ve picked up or anything to deal with your UC. God I’m super worried about travelling, I would love to explore more of the world (when the virus is over) I’m so anxious about doing things and being caught out. I guess you just gotta take the risk! 😬

I’m 20 years old and I’ve been suffering from Ulcerative Colitis for almost 2 years now. So last month I started to see a reappearance of blood in my stool - I hadn’t seen any blood from early December up until early April. I figured I was on the verge of getting into a really bad flare up. Fortunately that didn’t happen, and I believe I got lucky because I started drinking lots of water, particularly lemon water, and I’ve even tried drinking aloe vera juice (the pure bitter kind), and started to avoid foods that can worsen my symptoms when I’m flaring up such as dairy, fried foods, and fibrous foods. 

So ever since mid April I haven’t been in any pain, I’m not having frequent bowel movements, not feeling light-headed, or basically experiencing any other symptom except the blood in my stool. When it first started last month I was seeing a lot of blood in both the toilet and on the toilet paper. Now I’m mostly seeing it on the toilet paper, however my stools are often very liquidy and at times there is some blood in there but not much. When I check to see how much blood is on the toilet paper after I wipe it ranges from no blood, to mostly brown with a little bit of blood, to an even mixture of brown and red, and recently I had a bloody bowel movement with plenty visible blood in the toilet bowl and dark red blood on the toilet paper. My doctor currently has me taking balsalazide. My dosage is to take three pills three times a day. 

From late July to late November, 4 months, I was dealing with constant flare ups and almost always saw blood in my stool. I believe my flare ups were bad because at that time I was stressed and unsatisfied with my life, I hated my (old) job, I didn’t like school, etc, but I’m better now, mentally. So I would just like to know what can I do to improve my situation and have my bowel movements being healthy again.",2020-05-18 07:07:28

Some days it feels like it’s getting better, then all of the sudden I’ll have a bad day. I’m keeping a food diary, but I’m not sure how to use it for detecting problems.

All week, I felt like I was improving: no blood, only going 2-4 times a day. When my stools started to change from a 7 to a 5 on the Bristol chart, I thought there was a light at the end of the tunnel.

Flash to today and I’ve gone 9 times so far with blood in the last one. So, something is wrong. I had a Greek salad for dinner last night. This morning, I had my standard breakfast food, but added a half a cup of decaf coffee. 

Should I be looking at the salad or the coffee? My dr said I can eat whatever I want, but that has not proven to be true at all!

If I only have blood once a week, is that still a flare or just one bad thing I ate? I’m having a hard time figuring out what I should consider my new normal.

Also, I was recently diagnosed with diabetes and started Metformin a few weeks before getting my UC diagnosis. It makes it hard to tell whether I’m pooping from the UC or the medication, but the blood is definitely the UC and I would think that a change in frequency is also the UC.",2020-05-18 02:48:46

1436,A positive j-pouch experience,,21,gms0hg,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/gms0hg/a_positive_jpouch_experience/,26,"\*Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional and this is not medical advice or trying to convince you one way or the other. I am only sharing my experience.\*

I've had UC for several years now and had one loooooooong flare that no medicine would even touch. This past year I went for the surgical option. I had the two-step j-pouch surgery and have now had a functioning j-pouch for a few months. It's still early, but I cannot overstate how glad I am I did it. For context, I'm 24F.

While waiting for the surgery, I saw almost entirely negative stories online. Those responses are valid! I want to be very, very clear that I am not at all trying to discount others' experiences. I do want to throw in my two cents so that those who are considering the surgery hear from someone who is happy with the decision as well, because pre-op me wished she could have heard from and talked to someone like post-op me. Ultimately whether or not to get surgery is a personal decision and this is meant to be expository, not persuasive. 

I had a loop ileo for three months. I almost decided to keep it. I liked that I could eat a lot of different things and I had a lot more freedom to go places without worrying about bathroom availability, since a bag can be emptied or changed just about anywhere in a pinch. Some drawbacks of the bag were that supplies were expensive, it required a lot of upkeep, and it majorly interfered with my sleep. 

After the first surgery to create the ostomy, I thought life couldn't get any better. The second surgery was an even bigger improvement. My recovery from the takedown was unbelievably fast. Obviously I had to be careful about the wound for a while, but I was released from the hospital the very next day and only took Tylenol for about 24h after that.

Already this was so worth it for me. I usually go to the bathroom around 5-7 times per day, or a bit more if I have a lot of coffee. Before surgery I was at 30-40 every single day, mostly at night. Now I can regularly sleep through the night! I can also eat basically whatever I want, as long as it's well-cooked and I chew thoroughly. I'm not in pain for the first time in years, I can go places without worrying about a bathroom or running out of supplies, and I can hold it for as long as I need to so I don't live in fear of car rides. I feel great and I am extremely happy with my decision. Most days I forget that I have a chronic illness.

It's certainly not perfect. I very occasionally have skin irritation, which generally clears within a day, and I do wear a pad at night just for peace of mind. I've never actually needed it; I think I'm just paranoid from years of severe UC. My GI told me that about half his j-pouch patients get pouchitis at some point, but that almost all cases he's seen are mild and can be taken care of with a short round of meds. I'm honestly not concerned by the prospect. 

I know I've only had the j-pouch for a few months, but I wanted to share what it's been like so far. Sorry the post got so long!",2020-05-19 18:35:03

So I was hoping some redditors could help me out on this issue, and I’m sorry to offend anyone that’s uncomfortable talking about sex, but I really would like some feedback/answers...

I am a 31 year old gay man that has been diagnosed with UC for about 7ish years now. I have noticed signs of the UC since I was about 17/18 years old. I am lucky and have a relatively mild case. I take humira and lialda, and for the most part I keep everything in check, and have almost no symptoms....

So being a gay man, anal sex is a big part of intimacy with a partner. Ever since I’ve been sexually active, which started around the ages of 17/18, I have tried to receive anal sex, and it has never felt good/enjoyable for me. Tolerable at times, but that’s it. I have always wondered if this is related to my UC. It’s hard to be a gay man and not receive anal sex. For one, gay men are a small portion of the population, and with me being unable to receive anal (bottom) it limits the pool of partners even further. It’s a lot to ask of a perspective partner to date someone that would not want to bottom. 

I was really hoping someone on here has some experience or information. I truly wonder if it’s related to my UC at all, or maybe it’s just that I don’t like it. Any feedback would be much appreciated.

So here is the thing at the moment my UC i basicly non existent, all i do is take my medication every morning and evening (Asacol) and beside that i dont get any stomach aches or go to the toilet often etc. 

Altho now the last few months i have been totally consumed with these big 3 names/conditions and i have only been able to see negative, i was wondering what i can expect from the disorder in the future? will it get worse? will it stay the same? When do i get flare ups? is there some ppl who dont even get flare ups?

I know that these are things that i should ask my doctor and that its very individual but i just want to get a better grip of what UC is really and what sort of development one can expect. Thanks for reading and hope you can leave a reply with some information, will be reading everything ofc!:)

I (F, 30) have always been thin. I am 5'4 and typically weigh around 115lbs. I had a really bad flare a few years ago where I dropped down to 105lbs. Then, once I came out of the flare... I just didn't want to gain weight. Like I wouldn't be upset if the scale hit 110lb but I would make an effort to get back to 105lbs. I was recently hospitalized with c diff and a terrible flare. It dropped me down to 88lbs. Over the course of the 3 months that I was in the flare, I was usually around 95lbs. Now I have been healthy for a few months and I am up to 102lbs. That said, I feel like I should drop down to 95lbs. It's almost like this ""well I was there before so I should be there again"". I was only ""there before"" because I was really sick. Now that I am healthy, I am worried that I am actively choosing to not have a cookie, for example, in order to slowly get my weight back down. I am not starving myself or anything. It's just like ""well, I guess I can skip the ice cream tonight since I was 102 this morning"".

That was three weeks ago and I’m feeling pretty normal these days. Solid stools and no bleeding. I get the occasional abdominal pain (not that painful just bothersome) at night but it goes away with some tylenol.

Here’s the thing:

I had an appointment with my GI today and he wants to put me on entyvio straight away. I’m a bit wary about it, to be honest, since it seems a little scary (I didn’t think I would be at a biological straight away) and I’m feeling about 90% back to normal right now. He thinks I will relapse in symptoms again once my taper is complete. I believe him but I also don’t want believe him especially since I’ve been feeling great lately lol.

He gave me two options:

1) Start the entyvio right away

2) Wait for the taper to finish and if I relapse, begin another prednisone taper and start entyvio.

I feel like 1) is the better and more proactive option but I was hoping 2) wouldn’t land me in biologic territory and that I’d be fine with Pentasa alone. He also told me it’s easier to get my UC under control when my symptoms are not as bad as they might be when I finish my prednisone taper.

I don’t know. I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed by this new diagnosis. Things have moved quite fast.",2020-05-21 05:02:03

I've been able to drink in moderation and I was a MASSIVE beer nerd before I was diagnosed. Unfortunately, I do not handle gluten particularly well anymore... It doesn't flare me up, it just bloats me and makes me feel like garbage for a few hours. I have skirted that line, however, with beer and, oddly enough, there are beers that seem to not make me feel bad and others that do. Obviously the style of the beer has a lot to do with this and what it's fermenting grain is. Most breweries don't print on the case saying ""Brewed from barley, or oats, or wheat, or whatever grain"" so it has been tough to identify whether a beer will affect my stomach or not. It's just seemingly random as to which ones actually impact me... For instance, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale bloats me to hell and back but I feel normal after a Community Mosaic IPA. I am not sure why and I'd like to see if we can set a trend and gather enough information to figure out if there is anything particular about these beers that don't mess us up.

Basically, if any of you fellow beer enthusiasts skirt the fine line like myself, can you pitch in on what beers specifically have made you feel good or bad? Maybe we can all catch a trend of what could potentially be an easy beer for us to drink that isn't Omission or Red Bridge (bleh).

What I'm thinking is just a small note you can copy and paste, like this:

**Beer Name:** 

**Style:** (Blonde Ale, IPA, Nitro Stout, etc.)

**Primary Grain used (if applicable):**

**ABV:**

**Brewery Location:**

**Easiness to Digest:** (1-10?, short comment?)

**UC Severity:**

# Here is one I will fill out myself:

**Beer Name:** Community Mosaic IPA

**Style:** American IPA

**Primary Grain used (if applicable):** Blend of English Maris Otter and American pale base malts 

**ABV:** 8.6%

**Brewery Location:** Dallas, TX

**Easiness to Digest:** Can drink 1 or 2 and feel completely normal, bloating after more than 2

**UC Severity: 2**

I know alcohol is touchy on here because it is a common trigger but I really would like to get a solid list of beers that are on the easier side to drink for those of us cursed with this disease. It's going to have to be a community effort but if every beer drinker just commented one beer they've had where they felt fine after then we could get some really decent content.

I'm a 39-year-old woman who was previously diagnosed with an undifferentiated autoimmune disorder due to rashes (erythema multiforme), joint pain (mostly wrists, knees, and fingers), and unexplained low-grade fevers. Every few years I'll have a couple of months where I have diarrhea 6-10 times a day that wakes me up at night. In the past it's been enough that I've lost 10-20 pounds (I'm petite and my starting weight is usually 120 at highest). In the past it's never been bloody and it's always resolved on its own and I've had years of no symptoms.

But last year it happened and then resolved in about two months. And now, in January, I started having fevers, joint pain, and rashes, and then in February, BAM. Diarrhea 14+ times/day, waking me up at night, mucousy, bloody, and urgent. I went to the ER for abdominal pain and they ruled out anything that would kill me right away and told me to follow up with  my PCP. PCP thought I had norovirus and said to come back in a week if I didn't get better. Two months later, I was still having bloody, mucousy diarrhea between 6-10 times a day, every day. Haven't had a normal BM since February. My rash is back on my chest and stomach. All my stool tests for infectious causes were negative, but my doc thought I was dehydrated due to rapid resting heartrate.

Referred to GI doc. Had a telemedicine appointment, and the PA said, ""Classic colitis symptoms."" Sent me for a colonoscopy, which I had on Monday. The GI said he found nothing remarkable-- diverticulosis and ""congested mucosa of the sigmoid colon"" but nothing else. I have a followup Monday, but haven't gotten biopsy results yet. Resting heart rate is still 122-155 BPM, I can't seem to drink enough water to keep from being dehydrated, I'm exhausted.

I have a two year old at home and work full time with the public-- my job just called me back to work and we are re-opening soon. The GI doc told me while I was still groggy that basically there wasn't anything wrong with me. . .but if that's the case, why am I shitty bloody mucous every hour? It's like the worst stomach virus I've ever had but I've had it now for three effing months. I'm so frustrated and sick and exhausted, and I've just kept pushing through it all. If anyone has advice, words of wisdom, or lovely stories about medication that cleared it all up quickly, I could really use the support right about now.",2020-05-22 20:10:18

I got hospitalized two days ago and will stay here until June 10th. My daughter will be born on the 3rd. I am an American expat who lives in Japan. They keep you for way longer here after a baby is born than in the US.

Anyways they are not letting me eat anything until about June 5th, save for drinking sports drinks, teas, water or sucking on hard candy. Of course, they are also giving me a nutritional IV drip all throughout the day that they call 'high calorie.' It's 1100 calories.  *laughs in American*

I'm also getting hemoglobin because of anemia, IV prednisone, a bunch of other IV bags and injectables, the works. I just want to go into remission for my daughter and to be healthy for the C section. I don't want to get a bloody bloodclot and die.

Has anyone had success with this kind of fasting treatment? I seem to be improving, only going to the toilet once or twice a day, instead of the 15 it was before.

Thanks for the help everyone!**

Hi all! First post and I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask... So please delete if not allowed! I know none of you are docs but personal experience always helps!  

So a few months ago, I started having diarrhea on and off. I wrote it off as stress with all that's going on right now. But then about a month ago, I started waking up in the middle of the night with abdominal pain, cramping, and urgent need to go. The night I realized things were not normal, I had diarrhea 10+ times in a matter of a couple hours. This came with achiness, fatigue, and a low grade fever as well. 

After about 2 weeks of this, I got crazy dehydrated or something and ended up in the hospital because my heart was pounding and I felt like I was gonna pass out on top of everything else. They did a CT scan and found signs of inflammation in my colon. My blood tests also showed signs of inflammation. 

They ruled out a bacterial infection and ended up diagnosing me with ""colitis"". They never used the word ulcerative and if they did describe it, they called it ""infectious colitis"" or ""viral colitis"". They put me on a butt ton of antibiotics and fluids through an IV, as well as stuff to control the pain and spasms. Told me to stop eating fiber and that I should feel better in a couple weeks tops, but prob only like a week. 

Well it has been a couple weeks. I still have the abdominal pain and cramping, achiness, fatigue, and low grade fever. My PCP suggested I try eliminating gluten and avoiding dairy as well but it doesn't seem like food makes a difference. Any food or water in general seems to make things worse, no matter what it is. 

I have BMs less frequently now (less than 10 more than 5 a day) but I have been eating less and they are still a 6 or 7 on the stool scale, maybe a 5 here and there, but never anything solid. 

I have a follow up with the GI doc in a week and a half, as well as another CT scan. But they were scheduled to make sure the infection healed all the way. Now I am starting to wonder if this is a more serious, long-term problem?

I know I don't have symptoms near as bad as a lot of you on here but could it be a mild to moderate form of UC? What questions should I ask my doc? Should we be doing more diagnostic testing instead of another CT scan, which will just show that the inflammation is still there?",2020-05-23 08:12:39

She had been on humira for about 10 years until it stopped working, then cimzia for a year or so, and is now on stellara for about 8 months. A few months ago she started having some discomfort and as an act of desperation started the SCD diet. It's hard to say if it was the cause as she was in a diminishing trend anyway, but I'm guessing during the die out put her over the edge, and she developed massive inflammation to the point where she couldn't eat or drink water. She was admitted to the hospital for a week and lost massive amounts of weight during this period. She has been on peptamen feeding for a couple of months and is slowly regaining her weight. As part of a recent MRE scan she was told she likely had a stricture and would likely require another surgery while she was more in a phase of remission. We have some reservations about having another surgery as my wife is running out of small intestines and has had to have some extreme interventions (ex iron infusions) over the past couple of years, also implying less intestine may not work out that great.

We are pretty much to the point where we are willing the travel to a doctor to get the best advice we can and travel to a surgeon for the best surgery we can should it come to it.  I can't find an objective way to assess these doctors on my own, and am looking for recommendations of the best of the best.

So after seemingly forever my family is finally taking the plunge to move out of Florida and over to California.... not the greatest situation to be in moving in right now given the pandemic, but gears are already in motion and things have already been committed to so it's happening.
Nonetheless the closer it comes to moving the more I'm worried about the trip there. We're going to drive all the way from Florida to California, which is a very VERY long drive. I've been in a flare-up for almost a year now and now that I'm finally on meds I think I'm almost in remission, but I'm still having a few symptoms. The urgency is the scary one.
Luckily I'm down to 1-2 bms a day, but I'm just thinking that first shit of the day while driving could really fuck me over.
How do y'all deal with long car trips?? Should I take anti-diarrhea meds? Skip breakfast?? I've considered taking some cbd gummies my sister has in hopes it'll calm both my nerves and tummy.
I've been trying not to stress about it because I'm sure the anxiety doesn't help in the moment but given that I keep getting nervous gut everytime I'm out anywhere more than 15 mins away from my home (and thus a reliable bathroom) I'm not too confident about this moving trip haha.",2020-05-24 08:36:43

I was back home by around 16pm and after the treatment they gave me I felt okay, in the late evening Ive had another bad cramp and blood go and went back to sleep to be woken up exactly by same thing, so Ive drank the pills they gave me immediately and it helped and I was able to go full day without having cramps or taking shit. Now Ive had similar situation 3 years ago but I was having it go both ways and no blood and it went away within 24hours.

My husband is 8 weeks into a flare, 3 weeks ago he had his colonoscopy, they took 2 weeks to get back to him about his blood work, then requested more blood work and told him they were waiting on insurance approval. That was a week ago. Got a call today to schedule the infusion for 3 weeks from now. His nurse told us that she requested him to be put on priority. Is 3 weeks priority?? He has lost 30 pounds, hasn’t been able to work for over a month. I am about to lose my mind! I feel like as soon as he gets going on the Remicade we need to start looking for a new doctor. Nothing seems to move quickly or be a priority. It took a month of me calling twice a week to tell them the medications they kept prescribing weren’t working before they finally scheduled him for a colonoscopy. We have only spoken to his actual doctor once during this and at one point were told that they weren’t even sure when they would be able to schedule an appointment again just to speak with him. Wtf? Thank you in advance to this community!! You’ve helped me keep my sanity on these days. Being the caregiver and the natural administrative half in our marriage, all of this goes to me to manage.

Currently on 40mg a day for the past two weeks, I take 20 in the morning, 20 at night to help cut down on the severity of the side effects (I honestly don’t know if splitting it helps, but it’s works for my peace of mind so I’m sticking with it).

My question/problem is that I’ve realized I’ve been getting the jitters real bad for about half an hour or so during the day... maybe jitters isn’t the right word... it feels more like an on coming panic attack, though I know that’s not what it is —  elevated heart rate, feel like I can’t sit/stand still, feels like my hands are shaking. I tend to try to drink some cool water and do some deep breathing to try to ‘calm down’, but that kind of doesn’t really work. 

I know prednisone can cause these symptoms, so I know it’s not a panic attack, but does anyone have these? What do you do to counter them? I’m not too worried about them, I know it’ll go away when I start to taper, but they’re becoming annoying, which prednisone cranks anything annoying up to 11 for me as well... so needless to say, it’s been fun...

All of my UC symptoms have calmed down, so I’m hoping they’ll start me tapering off this week. 

On the plus side — anyone else use their high-dose prednisone time to get all the things done cuz you know that once you’re totally off it you’re going to be tired and drained af?

I was diagnosed with UC over 10 years ago. I have been in and out of flares for the course of 10 years and only over the last 4 year have I really made an effort, through lifestyle management, to get healthy. Initially my efforts were fruitful and, through diet (strict paleo)  and exercise, I was able to achieve non-medicated remission for 2 years. Diet and lifestyle slipped and I flared again in late-2018 and have been in and out of flares since. I have tried nearly everything I could think of (including going back onto my 5-asa orally) and cant seem to find any consistency in my condition. I will go from 2 to 12+ bowel movements from day to day and seem to cycle in and out of a flare every 3-weeks or so. 

Given that I do see fluctuations in my condition (for better or worse), I am confident that I can find a way to manage this through diet and lifestyle. Unfortunately, going through an elimination diet and waiting 3-ish weeks to see if certain foods trigger or not has been time consuming and stress inducing. 

I'm looking for more information on my body and how it functions and was curious to know if there is any valuable information to be had, for the benefit of digestive health, by undergoing some form of genetic testing?

I’ve just been tentatively diagnosed with UC. Because of the current pandemic, I can’t get in for a colonoscopy right now, but according to my bloods and my stool sample, it’s a straight toss up between UC and Chrons. My consultant said he’s pretty sure it’s UC. 

My Calprotectin level was high. Apparently above 200 is outside of normal. Mine was 3400! Which sounds scary as hell. 

But I’m also overjoyed. I’ve had horrible bowels on and off for years, with it getting really bad in the last 12 months. But it’s always been brushed off as ‘just IBS’ or ‘maybe change your diet’ - so to have a medical reason for everything is really reassuring. 

I’m starting some meds this week which Dr thinks will help. It’s a slow acting med that won’t put me at risk of Covid-19 as it’s not an immunosuppressive. So hopefully in a month or two I could be symptom free. Who knows though. 

I’ve had a read through, you all seem cool. So I hope to hang around a bit and get involved in conversations. 

So hello from me, and my dodgy bowels!",2020-05-27 19:02:09

Also, what are your experiences with the drug? Does it start acting fast? What side effects did you experience?

I had 2 doses of Inflectra during this flare with no improvement. I had a blood test right before the first of those 2 doses and the results showed that my levels were at a therapeutic level with no antibodies towards Inflectra. I was also in a 40mg prednisone taper over the period I was flaring and receiving the infusions.  

The course of prednisone has ended and my symptoms were back to pre-prednisone bad and getting worse. 10 BMs a day and 39°C fever and dehydration. Got admitted to the hospital and placed on IV cortisone. One week later, I'm down to roughly 2 BMs a day, less blood and only mild pain before and during.  

Before ending up in the hospital, my GI decided to double my next dose of Inflectra, but now he has decided that it is not worth it seeing the blood test results and my situation. So he gave me 3 choices: entyvio, stelara, and a twice daily pill which I forgot the name to.  

I'm pretty much set on entyvio, hearing the opinion most of you have. Also it seems that stelara is under review with my insurance, which could take months. I have no idea what that pill is call, but apparently it's relatively new and also lowers my immune system against viruses, which both my GI and I think it's not a great choice given the current situation.  

Sorry if I might be forgetting some information, I just wanted to get this all out while the conversation with my GI is relatively fresh in my mind, I'll answer any questions you guys have.  

So I just want to hear what you guys think of all this (just don't want to feel so alone). And also can anyone help me figure out the name of that pill please?  

Edit: I've decided to go with Entyvio. Wish me good luck!  
So, how do you guys deal with anxiety/worries? I feel like sometimes I worry a lot about things and it makes it very hard for me to get out of a flare. In fact, I think that my flares are brought on by all my worries. Hell, right now I'm thinking that even surgery won't stop my problems if I keep worrying about everything.

I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 2013, got into remission in 2014 and was medicine free until I was pregnant in 2018, severe flare, saw a new GI who looked at my records and symptoms and is convinced this is UC but won’t know for sure until he can do a scope. I went off the meds after my pregnancy. My flare has been moderate and manageable since then but recently I decided I couldn’t do it anymore. I reached out to my GI. As of last Friday I am again on: Uceris, Mesalamine and mesalamine enemas. I was ok for a couple of days but as of Monday I’m back to having blood, and now I have abdominal pain all day (didn’t have that before) and only diarrhea (no solid stools like before the meds). 

Anyways - my GI said that if I don’t see significant improvement within 10-14 days he wants to put my on prednisone again (I was on this during my pregnancy) because “now is not the right time to start biologics, due to Covid.” Well - the issue here is my experience was prednisone was less than stellar. It helped, but the side effects were so extreme for me that I said I would never do it again. Only reason I stuck with it before was for the safety of my unborn child. 

Does anyone have any stories or advice on a biological putting them into remission without a steroid  (prednisone)? I know I sound ridiculous  but I really refuse to go on prednisone again.

I can't help but feel really nervous, and like I've been hit by a tonne of extra anxiety. It's unlike me, I've learnt throughout my treatment process to just grin and bear it with an ""it's inevitable"" sort of mindset. Less morbid than that, I try to stay positive, but I sort of didn't consider any other options when my doc told me Remicade is my way forward. I just let it happen. I'm informed on the info, but there's a level of terrifying uncertainty that reading can't ease.

I'm scared of the side effects. Reading words like ""fatal lymphoma"" and risks of infections/bacterial viruses... It's just really getting to me now. 

Any advice? Positive experiences with Remicade will really help. Or even just any experiences, so I can know what to expect. Especially long term.

What is appealing about them? Was is the right decision for you thus far or have you found a better alternative? Loaded questions sorry, I'm just looking for perspective here. 

Brief background: I was diagnosed with UC a year ago after what ended up being a pretty severe flare, I wasn't responding to prednisone + mesalamine quickly enough in my GI's opinion and he wanted me to start Humira like a month or so into the diagnosis. It felt too soon to jump into something like that without giving the less scary drug a chance. My GI also felt like a car salesman with trying to get me to start Humira, I didn't get the feeling he had my best interest in mind and was very dismissive about alternatives and my concerns with biologics. The fact that I have to commit to it for the rest of my life is offputting, plus I could develop antibodies to it and be left with very few options after exhausting the biologic route.

Here we are about a year later and I'm back in a flare, it's not as severe as the last one, still bad though. I've been having exclusively 6-10 bloody/watery BMs for the past week, it started out with diarrhea and belly tenderness 2 weeks ago and has just been getting worse. I'm back on prednisone (40mg), still taking mesalamine, I just don't know how long I should wait around and see if I get worse or go back to the GI and seriously consider a biologic. I know everyone is different and this disease makes literally no sense sometimes. Again, just curious about your experiences because you're all awesome.",2020-05-28 04:30:36

1590,A poem I wrote this morning - The Hidden War,jelly_troll,39,gswtfz,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/gswtfz/a_poem_i_wrote_this_morning_the_hidden_war/,11," I awake to the distant sound of thunder, 

a low rumbling rolling out from deep inside me.

The sound is familiar, but deeply unsettling,

Instantly inciting anxiety and anticipation.

The clock reads 6:30, I grasp the next few seconds closely,

Willing this reality out of existence,

This bad dream might just disappear,

If I could just retreat back into those subtle memories.

&#x200B;

As another rumble rolls over my rectum,

I snap into action, moving as my life depended on it.

Reaching my sanctuary just in time, 

the volley echoing around me as I hunker down and brace for the inevitable onslaught.

Just when it seems to be over, I catch my breath,

But then another wave ensues.

A gasp, a whimper, a few tears as I again try and find cover in the past,

Cultivating my deepest roots in reality.

&#x200B;

This closet is my battlefield.This door becomes my enemy.

Tyranny and cruelty wait on the other side.

Shame, fear, pain, and an army of uncertainty.

In here I am safe, isolated from the existence of these immortal enemies,

or are they merely a manifestation within my own mind?

Until I leave the comfort of this trench 

I maintain control of the situation,

Modifying the stakes to suit my incontinence.

&#x200B;

Many minutes pass and emotions come and go like sweet and stale smells.

I finally muster the courage and grab my weapon,

Wrapping my hand delicately in white paper,

I brace myself for the inevitable disappointment.

Red, a color that is burned so strongly into every soldier,

Every butcher and every horror movie.

Like the red nose of a clown,

Crawling out from the depths of my own bowels.

&#x200B;

I bury this part of me, a flush that helps me heal.

Yet this is an experience I can hardly forget.

I hold it with me, waiting for the next call to action,

The urgent charge down the hallway, 

the uncomfortable call I can’t cut short enough.

Chills trickle through my body as I tighten down my buckle,

There is solace in surviving, I tell myself,

If we surrender to these battles then we lose the hidden war.",2020-05-29 19:05:14

1594,"Diatomaceous Earth - I Was Skeptical, but Now in Awe!",ChromeShavings,0,gsuyfe,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/gsuyfe/diatomaceous_earth_i_was_skeptical_but_now_in_awe/,14,"UC Community,

I've searched long and hard for something that would act as a... well... cure for my UC. I've read through so many posts on here just trying to find something that someone has used, or has tried that had almost or nearly cured all symptoms. But unfortunately the medical community (imho) is hiding the real cures from us, and we are stuck with taking 1000mg+ steroids (whether orally, rectally, or by injection), etc. I am in that same boat, and I still wish I could figure out why it all started just 2 years ago for me. I literally woke up and had issues - no joke! With all of this being said, I think I have found a ""potential"" candidate for my complete road to recovery. I'll list my vitamins I take as well. I believe in a combination of good things, rather than just a one-stop-shop product.

So one day my wife was scrolling through Instagram, and like everything that we search for or even talk about - her feed has suggestions on what she should buy (that's a rant I'll save for later). She was scrolling through her feed and all-of-a-sudden there was an Instagrammer who was commenting on the awesome (miracle/healing) properties of this dirt, and how it was a night and day difference for her symptoms. Now, take it, my wife has thrown several things at me in the past, and I'm a sucker for trying them out. I go into anything that could cure me (skeptically) so I don't get my hopes up. I decided... what the heck... why not? There was a link to the product on Amazon, and a couple clicks later it was ordered. Now, to the interesting part...

So about 2 weeks later (since Prime is no-longer Prime shipping during this Pandemic) we receive the ""dirt"" in the mail. This dirt is Diatamaceous Earth. That is - DYE-UH-TOH-MAY-SHUS Earth. Yeah, I know, the name even makes you question things. Anyways, I open the packaging up and a huge white dust cloud emerges. If this was coke, I just accidentally inhaled enough to send Snoop over the edge \[definitely avoid inhaling at all costs\]. I measure out a tbsp and mix it with water. And wouldn't you believe it..... it tastes like.... nothing. Nothing at all. Just water with sediment. No disgusting mineral taste (like iron... thank God), and nothing excitable like bowel prep sprite (just kidding). Just plain sediment water, and I was OKAY WITH THAT!

Fast forward to day 3 of taking this... dirt. I wake up for my morning routine, and at the end I look into the bowl and... no mucus. Hmm... okay. That's... weird... and exciting! Well, I was still skeptical. I go about my day, my week, and I have no urges to have to go. Heck I even introduced coffee back into my lifestyle (God bless that bean) and although it caused ""some"" inflammation, it went away completely the following week. I'm currently on week 3 of this ""dirt"" and I have to say... it's up there. It doesn't require destroying your taste buds for the sake of health, it is easy on the pocket book, AND you receive a 2lb bag that lasts you FOREVER. I take two mugs of water with 1tbsp in each mug - morning and evening. BUT... I don't want to say that is all I take. Earlier, if you recall, I said that I don't believe in ""one-stop-shop"" products, and that several play a role. I still believe that. I hope this helps someone who is/has gone through what I have been going through for the past 2 years. I'm tired of back-and-forth remission cycles, doctors not giving me a set plan of action (other than taking drugs), and having to change my overall lifestyle to adapt to my condition. If you have tried this miracle dirt in the past, let me and others know in the comments. I'm interested to see if this is a hidden gem, or if placebo has truly taken over. :P

&#x200B;

**Side Note/Mini Rant:** The conspiracy theorist side of me has to state this before I post. I think UC happens due to small parasites in our digestive tract. The medical community has yet to find this out, and we're treated for inflammation. We're told it's an immune response, but is it? I'm sure I'm 100% wrong, but for a dirt that acts as a natural pesticide (in the non-food grade) to remove almost all of my symptoms, just seems strange. And that it would work for so many with UC and Chron's. I challenge you all to do your own research. I'm not a doctor, and I have no prior experience in the medical field whatsoever. I just want to feel better, and so does my wife. She's the real heroine in all of this. I think it's time our medical community introduces more of what's naturally out there rather than what we can artificially make and sell. \*\*steps off soapbox\*\*",2020-05-29 17:23:52

That was with Melsalazine. I stopped taking Melsalazine some years ago since I was doing fine. Still am pretty much with some mild issues like loose stools (never need to go more than once a day) and recently constipation instead. I don't follow a diet for this as no food seems to really trigger a flare anymore and I'm lucky for that. I hope others out there can do just as well or even better.

Now in the last few months I've noticed issues with milk that's leading me to feel I've gone lactose intolerant. Symptoms all match it. Now I'm wondering if I've just been lucky enough to randomly go lactose intolerant or it's more related to my UC and management of it. I remember reading that UC sufferers becoming lactose intolerant can happen, buy do I even fall into that group when I'm in remission to such an extent? Am I even in remission if I still have loose stools most days but otherwise fine? Am I potentially making a mistake by not taking the medication thinking I'm fine?

The pattern is always the same... IV pred sorts me out, I go home, oral pred fails, back in hospital.

Injected pred is better than oral but still doesn't help enough to give the maintenance medication a proper chance.

I'm in a different hospital now and the docs seem more keen to find another way to help and want to try Ciclosporin, infused for 3 days then send me home with oral Ciclosporin.

I'll still be on the pred but that's just because I've been on it forever so will have to come off slowly.

It helps me a lot to be able to actually make me hungry AND actually keep food down.  In saying that, my GI which I am a little shaky about, wants me on Remicade ASAP, and I hate hate hate hate hate needles.  For those of you who are on Remicade does this sound a bit quick to jump to something as severe as infusion or is this sound normal for your experience?

2- the times they would properly dissolve, they created terrible gas and bloating.

So I tried a few things..tried taking them with my fiber  suppliment, before meals, after meals etc...

My best experience so far was taking one pill, four times a day. One at 8 am, one at 1pm, 6pm, and one right before bed.
Always about 15 minute after a meal.

This way if I have any urgent bowel movements, I only would pass one, undissolved, vs all four passing undissolved.  It seems this has helped me control some of my symptoms better since I been getting more of the medicine into my system.",2019-07-04 03:40:25

I'm new to UC as of late April and prednisone has it in remission, but I'm nervous about what will happen as I taper off (down to 5mg with Lialda).

My parents have recently been excited about this Bemer therapy that uses a PEMF (pulsating electromagnetic fields) mat that you lay on for 8 minutes twice per day or so for treating a number of things.  The success they've seen for people has them signed up as a distributor of these and they say they met someone with Crohn's who has been using it for almost a year now and eliminated medication.

That said, my parents are always into the next all natural alternatives and I'm very skeptical for several reasons.  I asked my doctor and he recommended against it saying that increasing oxygen in the blood may actually have negative effects for UC.

Bemer promotes the product for UC/Crohn's, but there just doesn't seem to be any good studies proving that this works for UC specifically and is safe long-term.

&#x200B;

As background, I was recently diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis and put on a mesalamine enema that is the generic version of Rowasa.  I did 6 weeks on the drug and am now symptom-free, and so we're tapering off of it with two weeks of taking it every other night.

&#x200B;

While on the Rowasa, I noted that I was struggling a bit more in the gym - I usually do dumbbell presses with 35 pounds, but couldn't get those up into position, so had to drop down to the 30 pounds.  I didn't think too much of it at the time - could be numerous explanations for it, including the UC itself.

&#x200B;

What I've noted since going to every other night on Rowasa is that my lifting is much better on the mornings after I DON'T take the Rowasa as opposed to the mornings after taking it.  On the mornings after I don't take the Rowasa, I'm fine with the 35 pound dumbbells.  

&#x200B;

1711,Wheatgrass is helping me treat and possibly cure(?) my Ulcerative Colitis*,biryani-brownies,0,carjlb,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/carjlb/wheatgrass_is_helping_me_treat_and_possibly_cure/,10,"Long Post. TL;DR at the end.

I’m on Reddit every day but I only recently found out about this subreddit and it’s the first time I’m posting. I’m only making this post purely for informational purposes by sharing my treatment methods for UC. I'm not a doctor and I am not trying to persuade, argue, or change anyone's minds.

I was diagnosed with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in the summer of 2010 after I graduated from high school. Since then I've had a flare up every 2 years and I've been on various medication and tried different diets, including the FODMAP diet. Currently my GI doctor prescribed me 2 tablets of azathioprine/daily and a Humira pen injection every two weeks. Even though the colonoscopy shows that I have three ulcers in my colon and hemorrhoids, the bleeding stopped and I’m in remission. During remission, if I don’t take care of my body by exercising and eating an appropriate diet, I constantly have either diarrhea or constipation, feel bloated, and always have the urge to use the bathroom and often have a very hard time controlling it.

Apart from the constant rectal bleeding when I have a flare-up and having to stab my thigh with the Humira syringe, the biggest thing UC affects is my diet. I'm South Asian American so I eat ""spicy"" Indian food that my mom makes every day at home, which triggers my UC the most. I also need to stay on top of exercising, which is hard when I don’t have enough energy from not eating enough.

I know there’s no cure for UC, but it’s treatable and manageable through the right medication, eating healthy, exercising, and staying on top of mental health. My mom, on the other hand, is a firm believer that praying and herbal/aryuvedic/alternative medicine can not only better treat but also cure any illnesses and diseases.

Ayurvedic medicine is deeply rooted in my family's history so I've been exposed to it as a child. It works for some, doesn't for others. In order for it to work, you have to believe that it's going to heal you and that you want to get better. I’m fully aware that from the perspective of western medicine, that it is a pseudoscience and works like a placebo. But I am also open to trying new things and cover all my bases, especially if I know that it’s worked for someone else.

Early this year my mom took me to see an herbal doctor for my UC. I started taking wheatgrass in the form of 4 tablets and a concentrated juice that I drink by mixing in a cup of water twice a day, every day. So 8 tablets and 2 cups of wheatgrass juice per day.

Just to back track a little: last year, I've also tried a Chinese medicinal tea I got in Chinatown and it was amazing. It gave me energy, helped me sleep better, made me feel relaxed, and immediately stopped any diarrhea, constipating, bloating, abdominal pain, etc. It was annoying to make and tasted horrible though. I had to boil down a huge pot of tea (which looked like leaves, flowers, seeds, bark, and things you’d find in nature) and drink three cups a day. For the medicinal tea to be effective, I had to also follow a very strict diet (where I couldn’t eat a bunch of foods based on if it had “hot” or “cold” properties). It was a very hard diet to maintain and I lost a lot of weight (I went from 120 to 95 pounds) because I made sure that I didn’t eat anything I wasn’t supposed to while not making sure that I replaced those foods with healthy, rich, nutritional foods. I drank the tea and followed the diet for four months. I continued bleeding again a few months later. When I went back to the herbalist, she said it was because I stopped following the diet (which was true). But I didn’t want to go back to the tea and diet again, so I just continued taking the azathioprine and Humira my GI prescribed me, which stopped the bleeding, but not any of the other symptoms.

After enduring the constant constipation, diarrhea, always having to go to the bathroom and not being to hold it in at times, and just feeling so tired and depressed all the time, I decided to take the wheatgrass medicine this year. I've been taking the wheatgrass since January 2019, so it's been 6 months now. I thought the wheatgrass was going to be a repeat of the Chinese herbal tea, but after getting the results back from the colonoscopy a few weeks ago, I’ve found that I’m no longer bleeding and the ulcers that were in my colon before, completely healed.

When I started taking the wheatgrass, I just hoped for the best. Even though I stopped bleeding and felt better, I didn’t believe that it would help me until the colonoscopy results confirmed that I was getting better from the inside. And now seeing a picture of my clean, pink, non-inflamed colon instead of those ulcers that were present in the inner lining of my colon, I am beyond relieved.

I still need to take the wheatgrass medicine for six more months. I have yet to see if it continues working and prevents bleeding. I think as long as I take wheatgrass (and exercising + healthy diet), I will be fine. The only thing that I’m worried about is that after I discontinue the wheatgrass, I’ll just continue bleeding again. Research shows there’s no cure for ulcerative colitis. I believe the science and data. But I also know that it’s working for me—for now. Even if it’s not a long-term fix, wheatgrass still helps alleviate pain and discomfort associated with UC, and that’s good enough for me. What do you guys think? Does anyone have any experiences similar to any sort of medicinal teas or herbal medication?

**TL;DR:** Wheatgrass stopped my rectal bleeding and symptoms. I hope that it continues to work in the future. If you have any experience similar (or different) to mine (using diet/medicine/lifestyle/anything to manage your UC), please share! Thanks for reading!

Lastly, I want to emphasize that one diet, lifestyle, or treatment does not work for everyone. Every body is chemically different. A woman told me that she started eating a certain type of mushrooms in large quantities which cured her UC. Upon hearing this, did I start eating mushrooms? I looked into it, but nothing more. And there certainly isn't any judgement. I've talked with many people with UC and different things worked for them. Hank Green did a video on Ulcerative Colitis and attitudes and beliefs towards various treatments. My main takeaway from all of this is to have hope and keep your horizons open. Just because a certain medicine doesn't work for you, don't just automatically assume that your UC will always control your life and there's no way to treat it.

\*I put an asterisk in my title because it doesn’t have all the necessary information and can be misleading. I consume wheatgrass in high dosages and my UC is pretty mild. I’m only consuming wheatgrass but I also stopped eating red meat (beef, lamb, goat, and turkey; never ate pork). I also stopped consuming any red chili peppers or powder. I eat bland food (for an Indian) and don’t eat certain vegetables that my colon can’t always digest (corn, asparagus, brussels sprouts, etc.) I’m also very physically active now so that definitely affects my UC vs. the effects of the wheatgrass on its own. I also don’t drink or smoke at all if that makes a difference.

Some background here, I am a 31yr old female weighing around 180-185 at 5'4, before being diagnosed I was taking the diet pill Lomaria (low dose phentermine), I actually think it's what caused me to start flaring for the first time as it makes me poop almost immediately after taking it and the movements would burn/hurt but I digress, now that I am trying to get better and go into remission I have stopped taking the phentermine since it A) makes me poop and B) annihilates my appetite completely. 

Even without the Phentermine I have to take cannabis in order to have an appetite anymore and I practice intermittent fasting during work hours so as to not have symptoms at work. So if I eat, unless I'm high it's less than a palm full of anything but I am not losing any weight. In fact some days I weigh more than usual even without eating. 

This is causing a huge mental issue for me because I spent most of my life anorexic, gaining entirely too much weight during treatment for the ana and then yoyo dieting trying to lose all of it again. I am terrified to gain weight. I dont need it, I'm already chunky but I am also now losing my hair, my skin is dry and itchy all the time and I feel like crap unless I take cannabis. 

What gives? Why am I gaining weight when I don't put anything in there? 

Another thing worth mentioning is even if I eat a large meal I may sometimes have to go to the bathroom after and sometimes may not have an actual movement for 3 days instead just getting a ton of urgency but when I get to the toliet all I get is bloody mucus. My stools also appear to be covered in a white film. 

Anyone with advice or information, I would be very excited to learn it please.

Honestly this sub kind of bummed me out about this disorder, because it seems like once you get this, you never fully get back to your old self, and you can never have a normal life.

Is this true?  The doctor said that once I do a month of prednisone and that medication that starts with an M I could be 100% my old self again, hopefully.  He was really optimistic.

Anyway I started to treat my colitis with budesonid rectal foam and my urgency was gone after just one day!! Yesterday I went to the office without taking the Imodium and even drank a coffee!

I was first on the meds that I can't remember the name of, lialda I think? 4 big red horsepills a day. It wasn't helping so I went on remicade and have been doing that since April 2016. It works great the first few weeks but I still have appetite problems and fatigue(both issues are related to stress/anxiety/my autism). No real negative effects, just occasionally low blood pressure while getting an infusion.

I love research and studies and have thought before how being part of a clinical trial would be rewarding, but now that there's an offer for it, I'm not really confident in myself for it. I obviously don't know if I would be part of the group taking the new medication or if I would be part of the control group, but I'm worried about several things. Side effects, if I have to go off remicade and how I'd respond to getting back on it if I did have to take a long break. If it will cause new problems, stuff like that.

I also don't know if there will be any compensation for it. I had to quit my job last month after it was negatively affecting my everyday life and health, so I don't have that to worry about, but that also means without compensation I'd have to get the money to travel to and from the dr and the trial lasts for 61 weeks.

I believe i am just starting a flare up. I called up my doc and told him what I've been doing. It was the 4th of July week, so I just want to drink and live it up with my friends. The same thing happened last year too. I'm now on Apriso (again, last flare was last year, this is my third one) and it seems to work for me. I just need to rant, I feel like even though no matter how much I tell my friends, no body truly understands. My dad had Crohn's so he totally gets it, but we have different symptoms.

&#x200B;

Does anyone else drink? Like it was very heavy drinking I have done over the last week. And it is so amazing to me because despite my hard efforts of eating clean and working my ass off in the gym and taking all the supplements, it only takes one weekend of severe drinking to ruin all of my heart and soul of work I just put into myself. Like, I want to go out with my friends and get drunk with them and be young and have fun, but I just simply can't do it. I am so sad over it. I guess I can drink but just do it moderately? I don't know I'm still trying to figure it out. The new wave seems to be Whiteclaw, but I think at this point I'm trying to figure out things I can drink. I guess it's all alcohol huh?

The whole capsules just fall out with a splash. (I’ve checked—they aren’t hollow or filled with something else. The coating isn’t dissolving at all, so no mesalamine is even being released).

My insurance doesn’t cover much other than Lialda, so I’m stuck.

However, I’m able to easily make solutions at various pH values. My thought is to dissolve the Eudragit coating from all of my Lialda tablets, likely just in distilled water, immediately remove them from solution, and then recoat them with something that will dissolve at a slightly lower pH.

It’s that last part that I’m having trouble with: I don’t have a source of proper enteric coatings. Evonik, who makes the Eudragit coatings that are used on both Apriso and Lialda (which are slightly different from one another), and can produce a coating for any specific pH, does not appear to just sell these coatings to the public.

Does anyone know of an alternative source for such coatings? Either a dip or something that can be applied as a one- or two-part system should work.

Of course before actually taking any of these altered pills, I’d run them through a bevy of solutions at various pH values to perfect my method and make sure they work properly!

**UPDATE:** I may have found a solution, by consuming dietary fat at the same time as taking the Lialda. I wrote [more about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/cdr0ee/butter_your_lialda_boy/).",2019-07-12 23:20:57

Well I’ve been on prednisone since then, and am currently at 12.5mg. I can’t do a full taper off cuz when I do I go into a flare. I finally got better insurance and was able to get in to the awesome dr last week.

Also, the slight insomnia. 

So my fellow, UCers, any way advice on how to deal with the side effects above or just push through? The plan is to get on Remicade ASAP and once that starts get the hell off of the prednisone and delzicol.

I have never posted anything before but after all this trauma I feel the need to connect with other people who understand and feel like I’m not the only one living this. So I read a lot of your stories and felt like sharing mine. At first, I didn’t think of this chronic disease as a big deal. I just thought “ Ouf ain’t cancer or something big”. Jokes on me. 
So I was diagnosed in September for ulcerative colitis. Long story short, in March i got a massive flare up ( I would shit, piss and vomit at the same time) and in May after all the treatments failed,(mezavant, prednisone and Remicade) had 4 blood transfusions and lost 35 pounds. I had to undergo immediate ileostomy surgery because I was loosing to much blood.  Although, they kept a piece of my rectum for a reconnection in the future. 5 weeks later, I started going back to work (I know, I know, I’m hyperactive and i couldn’t wait to get back on my feet) I even passed my lifeguard exam (Doctor said as long as I don’t push myself to hard it would be okay) but then I had a blockage in my small intestine (Adhesions) and had to undergo another surgery. One week ago, I had an abscess (infection) because my rectum is still sick so I had ANOTHER surgery (abscess drain). I’m currently stuck with a tube up butt ( 10/10 don’t recommend) but at least I’m home so it’s less depressing. 

Now I don’t even know if I want to reconnect my rectum because the doctor wants me to do other doses of Remicade and is it actually worth taking all those drugs for a better lifestyle? On the other hand, I don’t feel like I have a choice because Doc said I could develop another infection if left untreated. I don’t know, I’m just starting to believe that it harms me more then it heals me. Plus, there is so many side effects with that treatment. What do you people think?  

It hurts my ego having a pouch (Legit I just don’t know if I’ll ever NOT have a shirt on at the beach) but at the same time it keeps me alive so I don’t care.

I really hope all of you guys stay in remission and live your best life. 

Peace

DH (48) has had UC for 15 years. he usually has moderate flare ups 2-3 times a year. this one has been a weird one though! about 6 weeks ago he got a gum infection. doc gave him antibiotics, which of course set off a mini flare that was pretty intense. intense enough for him to be put on a short, sharp 1 week course of prednisolone. fast forward a fortnight and he gets a sore throat and nausea. back to doc. he gets a throat spray. sore throat goes away. nausea stays. and stays. and then this week it intensified. the vomiting started, he stopped eating and i've had to put on my nagging wife voice to get him to even drink water. since last night he has vomited all the water back up...but now it's streaked with reddish brown and he's convinced it's from his meds (which admittedly are red) but being physically sick like this is so unusual for him and i'm slightly freaking out and i don't want to freak him out, but...i just don't know what to do. 

&#x200B;

He thinks that this is his UC evolving again (his symptoms have changed a bit since he was first diagnosed) and that as he will be seeing his consultant in 8 weeks he should just wait until then. i'm like NO. no thank you. lets call the hospital in the morning and see if she can see you sooner than that. 

he's very stubborn and thinks that he can just wait it out (he tried this when he had toxic mega colon...didnt work out that great!)

What has also struck me is what we wish others knew about the disease or how we wish our friends and family could relate on a more personal level. 

So I wonder if it would be feasible and if there’d be any interested in a lighthearted book of 
-memes
-personal stories about supportive friends and family, poop, hospital stays, symptoms, surgery, and recovery
-an “I wish more people knew” section
-whatever else makes sense

The purpose would be for us to have this in our bathrooms as light reading that may also help others learn a thing or two about how to relate to us without shoving research down their throats or answering the same questions a thousand times. 

I’m thinking we find an artist (from this group?) to illustrate everything so it’s all cohesive artwork. Then collect stories, memes, etc to submit to our artist. After the work is complete, we get it published somewhere and sell as many as we can to cover costs and then donate the rest to (I forget the name...) the Crohns Colitis Foundation. 

Would here be interest in this? Is there an artist here who’d like to take this on? Any suggestions to make this idea better or actually come to life?",2019-07-15 17:46:14

My health has been deteriorating during the past couple weeks and I'm scared. I'm fatigued no matter how much I sleep, and my lymph nodes on either side of my groin are aching.

I was investigated by an Infectious Disease doc for parasites/STDs etc (blood tests, stool tests, swab tests) but no dice. Even had a CT scan. She said I might need to see a different medical group so I can get looked at with fresh eyes. Just waiting on further instructions from her.

The GI doc who did my colonoscopy said he'd be willing to put me on a couple weeks of prednisone to see if that helps. I messaged my other doc to see if she'd be cool with that. I should go for it, right?

Doesn't UC often start out mild and begin as proctitis? Am I crazy for thinking it's the most logical explanation??

Anyway, I'm getting hives around my injection site (and it's definitely hives not just irritation). My doctor suggested I take Benadryl before I inject--that didn't work. My humira nurse suggested I inject in my leg instead of my stomach--that was way worse with a much larger reaction. My doctor is suggesting I take Zantac for two days leading up to my injection. I was wondering if anyone has had this experience and what has worked for you to keep the hives at bay? 

I really want to stay on humira as it's easy and it's working, but in worried since the reaction keeps getting worse that this will turn into a full blown allergy attack.

1841,flare & in-law family dynamics,spojmai,3,cf2u7i,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/cf2u7i/flare_inlaw_family_dynamics/,2,"Hi everyone,

This is a multi-faceted post...dealing with family & flare-ups.  I'm in need of some advice:) 

I've had UC for 11 years. I've managed it lots of ways throughout the years but now that I have time, I'm taking a more holistic approach. In short, things take longer to resolve when you're addressing root causes. Everyone has their own opinion and reasons for doing things so I'm not here to advocate for any approach but this is just what I'm doing right now/what is working for me & my lifestyle. So when I have a flare-up, it'll take a lil while to get better.

&#x200B;

On another note, I recently got married and I'm dealing with lots of new people. My in-laws live about 45 mins away from us (with the usual traffic, an hour). They want us to come over, obviously. I can't go over during a flare-up and I no longer feel comfortable telling them I'm having a flare.

&#x200B;

My mother-in-law and father-in-law don't understand my condition and I sense they lack compassion to learn what it is. They're not the type to listen. When I first met them and I had a mini-flare, my mother in law asked my husband, ""Is she going to be sick forever?"" in a condescending way. My father in law is the type of person who thinks anyone who says they're sick is just complaining. My sister in law is a physician-- she gives me unsolicited medical advice (without knowing my UC history) and it's annoying (to say the least) because I have the right to say no(!!) or yes(!!) to whatever I want when it comes to medication and health care.

&#x200B;

They don't respect boundaries. They're the type to give 1-hour notice for family dinners or events and then get upset if we don't show up. My husband and I have unconventional schedules- we work for ourselves so we're not 9-5. Because of this, my in-laws expect that we should just drop everything. They also don't take no for an answer. They will keep saying ""Why? What are you doing instead? Just come. It'll be nice! Cancel your plans."" over and over again. 

&#x200B;

My UC complicates things. But even if I didn't have UC, my husband and I are newlyweds. We want space to organize our time and routines so we can build a home (and that takes time...). The pressure they put on us is so unhelpful. I understand that they want to see us. But I also don't get the purpose of seeing us if we just go there and stare at a wall and no one is being genuine or listening.

&#x200B;

In the beginning, I was really excited to get to know them and spend time with them. Overall they're a wholesome family. My issue with them is that they don't listen. I could be talking about something important and serious (i.e. UC or my grandfather's recent death) and everyone just drifts off and starts new conversations about nonsense. And given my experience with how they are re: my UC, I don't feel comfortable telling them when I'm having a flare and can't see them. **Does anyone have some advice on how to deal with family that is clingy but also doesn't listen/take no for an answer? I hope what I've written makes sense.**",2019-07-19 06:10:06

I have no one in my life to ask for advice about this besides my quack primary physician and my GI, so I apologize if this seems long-winded.

I was once a healthy teenage male. Zero health problems whatsoever, that is, until I went to college. My freshman year was fine; I was able to work out 3-4 days per week, eat whatever I wanted, etc. Sophomore year saw my first bloody movement, and my first flare, and from there everything has been in a tailspin.

Colonoscopy my junior year led to my diagnosis of acute-to-moderate UC (no family history, no warning signs, just decided to show up), where I was first prescribed a combo of Prednisone and mesalamine, which had little to no effect. I've had one major flare-up since my diagnosis, which led to me being prescribed Humira, which I'm still taking every 2 weeks. I was symptom free for about 8 months on Humira, but have been experiencing bloody stools again for the past 4 months.

Now at 23, I'm a shell of my former self. Almost all workout routines put me in a state of fatigue so intense I pass out within 15 minutes, so I've basically stopped working out altogether. Even walking long distances at work requires me to frequently stop and regain stamina. I've become lactose intolerant, and nearly every beverage besides sport drinks and water causes immense gas pains.

I'm simply asking if there's anything I can do to try to better cope with this disease. As of right now, I feel like I'm still living in a state of denial which isn't helping. Should I try to resume exercise activities? Is there anything in my diet that I could change? Can I live a sociable college life without looking like a ""special case""?",2019-07-20 04:42:51

Boyfriend and I are buying a house and the process of doing so involves a lot of inefficient bureaucracy and following up with professionals that seemingly are too busy to provide a service we are paying for. This has gotten me in a ton of stress and my stomach constantly feels in a knot. If all goes according to plan this will all be over by September but until then we are on a tight deadline and not sure if we'll manage.

What is currently worrying me and my question to you guys is regarding Life insurance. I'm really worried that the price of Life insurance is going to go up significantly because I have colitis (also 30 bmi). 

Have any of you gone through getting life insurance after being diagnosed with UC? What were your experiences? 

Trying to prepare myself for the worst but it just makes me more stressed not knowing what the worst could be. It's such a vicious cycle.

**Update:** I did get insured but the premium went up by 180eur per year. Which is not the worst but a bunch of money still. Also update regarding the progress of the house is we're almost to the last step, the contract, but seems like every week something new comes up, I'm trying to be positive and calm to stress less but feels near impossible.

I've had UC for about 5 years now, but I just moved to Philly and need to find a new GI. That being said, I wanted to see if anyone had a better way of seeing whether the doctor might be good than looking at their online profile for an IBD specialization. 

The main reason I'm asking is because I have about 170 options to choose from within a 5 mile radius and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. My insurance (Independence Keystone East) makes it so I have to get a referral from my PCP to go see a specialist, but I would like to dodge any bad eggs if at all possible.

Nothing unusual seemed to happen. My stool felt well-formed as it came out, as it has lately, to a little on the hard side. I sat there for a while—five to ten minutes—wanting to pass as much as possible (and checking reddit).

When I looked down, however, the toilet water was all red. Deep red. I hadn’t felt any blood or liquid of any kind, but there it was. Yet there was no blood whatsoever on my toilet paper—in fact, basically nothing at all, but the water was crimson.

I was rather concerned. I’ve never had blood like this. This was a huge amount. However, I remembered three things:

1. The toilet water was blue before I sat down, likely from toilet bowl cleaner;
2. I have been taking a lot of turmeric to see if it helps with my ulcerative colitis;
3. Turmeric is an acid-base indicator and turns deep red above a pH of 8.6.

So was it possible this was just a chemical reaction?

To find out, I flushed the toilet. Then I found the toilet bowl cleaner under the sink and cleaned the toilet. I then dumped in a little bit of the contents of a turmeric capsule. Nothing. The powder just floated, and didn’t even dissolve.

So I waited a bit, and swished the turmeric around with some toilet paper and ... slowly the water turned brown then a deep, dark red.

I’ve never been so relieved by a chemical reaction.",2019-07-22 06:27:30

I've had UC for a long time now, something like over 6 years, and have been in remission for a couple of years now thanks to Azathioprin, Mesalazin, and Inflectra and learning not to stress. However, I had a ONS w/ a girl a few months back who proceeded to tell me immediately afterwards that she has herpes (i.e. she intentionally chose to neglect to tell me that upfront) and that I should get checked.

Well, I didn't get any symptoms except an itchiness, and went to the doc, but he said not to worry too much if I had no symptoms. Later, I had an Inflectra session (during which I informed the doc about my mishap, and they said it's okay to take inflectra as long as I'm not showing symptoms) and it went fine. Great, right? WRONG

a couple weeks after I started getting dandruff(?) on my groin area so I went to a clinic and insisted on a blood test. Well results are negative but now the itch is horrible and like it doesn't exactly look like sores but it's something. I went to a doc this morning, and he checked me out and said it could be fungus, and prescribed a cream.

Thing is, the cream is a cortisoid and the instructions are pretty adamant about not applying to herpes infected areas, which I'm still not sure I don't have, bc blood tests test fro Herpes antigens, which my body might probably not produce since I'm so friggin immunocompromised? I haven't applied it yet. 

I've got an Inflectra session tomorrow and hopefully I can meet with the doc and clarify how accurate the tests are considering I'm immunocompromised, and what would I have to do/take if it turns out I had herpes (antivirals are like, the opposite of immunosuppressants, right?)

Like, fuck, I'm so mad at that girl for not being upfront with me. Reading this post I realise it's a lot of ranting, and I'm sorry, but I can't really talk about this w/ the people around me. I would appreciate any advice/info you guys have esp if you've experienced this before bc Google has been super unhelpful

Just need to vent. Had a random ingrown toenail out of nowhere two months ago (first time ever), got prescribed cefalexin immediately by my doctor while also being told to go see a podiatrist. 

See the podiatrist, he cuts some stuff off, gives me a topical antibiotic (fucidin) and tells me that wisdom in the podiatry world is that oral antibiotics for toe infections are pointless because the source of infection is still there. With great confidence, he assures me everything will be fine and that it will resolve in a week.

A week later, I have pretty bad diarrhea getting worse by the day, even after finishing the first round of antibiotics. Worried that I am starting a flare, I start eating accordingly. Soon after that, I phone my GI’s office and explain the situation. Three days later it’s confirmed I have C. difficile, the week before a vacation out of the country. 

Go on my vacation taking vancomycin to fight the c diff, everything going decently well up until I finish the 10 day course, then things start regressing. 

Return from vacation, see my GP for suspected strep throat, he looks at my toe which has also regressed, doesn’t bother swabbing my throat, puts me on amoxicillin (now my third oral antibiotic in 6 weeks). GI cancels my colonoscopy **during prep day** saying I need to get c diff taken care of first, despite the green light to continue prepping days before, prescribes me 14 more days of vancomycin. 

So here I am, on my other vacation week in July, bedridden at a tiny resort, having just finished my amoxicillin and half way through my vancomycin, getting worse by the day. Thinking of flying back early and trying to get admitted to a hospital, but trying to figure out which one does FMTs. Oh yeah, the toe is still infected.

To end on a more positive note, I am grateful for Canada’s medical system and for having 100% pharmaceutical coverage through both my spouse and my company’s insurance plans.",2019-07-23 01:42:03

Now I found this subreddit and I learned so much! He does not always like to talk about it since he doesn't want UC to become a defining part of his personality. I know understand so much better.

I found some good recipes I will try out to (maybe) help with his flare (or at least make them less terrible?) like grilled chicken breast with rice and I will talk to him about probiotics and some other ideas I found here.

When I first found out I had UC I was in the middle of an awful flare, and I was surprised to hear that I had such an “odd” and “rare” disease. I went from living a normal life as a college student, athlete, and family member to living a much more drawn back and restricted life to the point where I don’t feel like the same person anymore. It’s ALWAYS in the back of my mind no matter what I do. If I think about it, I have to run to the bathroom almost immediately, I can’t eat certain foods without gagging, I barely sleep, I have little to no energy, and I’m lost to say the least. 

I tried prednisone, budesonide, and so on and nothing worked. That was until I started doing Remicade treatments. Remicade worked like an actual miracle drug, I was out of my flare and living a normal life within weeks. I had forgotten anything about my UC and went back to living and enjoying my normal life. Fast forward a couple months. Me being stubborn and uninformed, I chose to take myself off of Remicade because I thought “well I’m cured, and I’ll just get more Remicade if I get sick again”. Big mistake. 

The next flare up would be one of the worst I’ve ever experienced. Over a 10 day period I went from 250lbs to 225 lbs, I couldn’t eat, drink, workout, sleep, you name it and I couldn’t do it. When I finally got back on Remicade, it worked, and took me out of my flare, but I noticed it wasn’t full strength like before. Still blood in the stool, still insane amounts of urgency, so I contacted my doctor and let them know. I was informed to go through 2-3 doses to see how my body reacted, and to my surprise, the drug hasn’t been working like it used to at all. Fast forward, I sought out a different doctor and she was fantastic at providing me with options for medicine. 

That being said, how do you guys cope with this disease? Is there anything specific you do on top of medicine that keep you out of flares or at least reduces your urgency? I’ve done the obvious like Imodium and gas x in times of desperate measures, but really haven even had luck with those when I’ve needed them the most. All in all I’m really just trying to improve my quality of life so I can somewhat enjoy even the most basic daily activities.",2019-07-24 21:53:43

The doctor ran tests on her to make sure it’s not a flare and decided to give her a viral bacterial antibiotic that seemed to work after the first day of taking it. 3 days later the results come out and she finds out there were no viral infections, meaning I’m thinking it’s a flare. 

The weekend comes through and she is feeling perfectly fine. On the Sunday she starts feeling severe pain in her back but pushes through like a champ because we thought it was due to her cramping up after going through a lot of body fatigue. On Monday it was still worse. Tuesday it got so bad that she came home in tears and has major nausea. We thought it was rest but ended up going to the ER to find out she was extremely dehydrated and was given an IV and some morphine for the pain. After the entire IV her stomach started hurting (we think it’s her colon). She took some tramadol which was prescribed by the doctor. Now she’s doing well.

This is the first flare we are experiencing, any advice on how we dealt with the situation and whether there are certain things to expect post flare? Her diet is very clean and by the book. Any recommendations for other prevention and suppression techniques for the future?

I was diagnosed with UC last October and was in and out of the hospital for 2 months before getting a double dose of Remicade to keep me under control (I have posted on the subreddit previously). After my May infusion, I was terrified that my Remicade had begun to fail. I slowly started having more BMs with more and more less normal stuff, But I was only up to 5 BMs each day a month out from my next infusion so I decided to wait to see if my next infusion helped. 

It didn’t. I was so much worse, I cried the entire next day at work anytime someone asked how it went and made an appointment with my GI for the following week. Ended up having a day with 16 BMs in a day and going on food strike for a little over 48 hours, which made me feel much better. My doctor ordered some tests and prescribed a small course of steroids when I saw him last week, and the results just came in... I have C Diff! I have never been so relieved in my entire life. I was sure that I had begun to fail Remicade and would have to spend the next few weeks and or months trying new medicines to calm down my UC. I cried with happiness when the nurse told me it was just C Diff... and I think she thought I was insane. She started explaining what it was because I think she thought I thought it was a good thing. 

So, I know it’s fairly common for us UC and immunocompromised people to get C Diff. What should I expect in the next coming weeks as I take the antibiotics? From reading on the internet and from my experience over the past couple of months, it seems like it is just a slightly more tame flare?  Any advice from you guys on special things to do? I am currently 100% back on my low residue diet, which I will probably continue for another month.

I have been trying to lighten my mood by imagining ridiculous pranks I could play on my gastroenterologist, to occur during the colonoscopy. (Obviously, none of this is serious; just trying to find some humor here.)

Here are a few of my ideas:

* Perform [henna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna) or ink enemas to dye my colon completely black
* Carefully and precisely glue my anus shut with cyanoacrylate (i.e. super glue) so it appears that I don’t have one
* Swallow or insert tiny double-sided photographs of famous missing people (Jimmy Hoffa, Amelia Earhart, etc.)
* Pre-fill my colon with eight liters of helium so when the endoscope is inserted, the helium leaks out and the doctor will speak in a high-pitched voice
* Swallow carefully-timed 3D-prints of short phrases so the doctor encounters them in a certain order (“Help / I am trapped / inside / this colon”)
* Fill my colon with live ants

23YOA, diagnosed at 21 with UC indeterminate. Have been on oral mesalamine for a little over a year now with only one time other than this instance where blood returned but no diarrhea.

For the past month, I have had blood either on the stool, on the paper or dripping a little after I finish. I have only had ""diarrhea"" once, but if I can remember it was mostly just blood and some smaller formed stools. My GI initially said it was either hemorroids or an anal fissure because my inflamation markers were at 1.7. He prescribed the anucourt (hydrocortisone suppository) for 2 weeks and it seemed to do something, I guess? I have been noticing that my BM's are slowly going back to no blood and normal urgency.

I stopped coffee and an inulin supplement about two weeks ago and my urgency has drastically reduced. From 6-8 times a day (formed stools and blood) I am down to 2-3 times a day with formed stools and some blood. Still taking Mesalamine/lialda.

I am going in for a flex sigmoidoscopy ordered by my GI because now he is saying it is probably colitis that is making this happen.

Anyone have any advice or input? This is the second time this has happened to me. Last time it was about 1.5 months of this back in November-December 2018. This started very late June, so early July. I've also been using cannabis/CBD oil and have noticed some effects, particularly on reduced stress. Not sure if it's just placebo.

I also just needed to vent a little bit. Feel free to comment about your experiences as well. 

Hey just read this in my comments and thought I’d let you know how it’s going now that it’s been 104 days haha.

As my far as my UC symptoms go, I’ve never felt better. I’m going to the bathroom once maybe twice a day, no blood, no urgency, no pain at all. I really couldn’t be happier with how my UC is doing. It almost feels like before I even had the disease. 

Which is ironic because everything else that’s going on kind of sucks right now haha. it is sort of a new medication but It’s true what they say about the weakened immune system and higher risk of infections. Over the course of a little other a month I’ve had c diff again. I had a perirectal abscess that I had to get drained. An anal fissure which causes horrible colon spasms and contractions, it also made me constipated. I had a swollen part of my anus from all the straining that I think could be a hemorrhoid but it seems way to painful. So I’ve been doing a lot for all of that too. (Hyoscyamine, fiber gummies, a topical ointment, Miralax, sitz baths.)

Unfortunately I’m also dealing with quite a few side effects from which I believe are coming from the xeljanz (I’m taking like 5 other medications so who knows.) Lately I’ve been feeling really tired and weak. It’s been hard to get around and I’ve been resting a lot more. Numbness and tingling in my legs and feet. Cold chills, night sweats, fever, shortness of breath, shakiness, and tremor. I have anemia too so that doesn’t help. Yes I’ve considered going to the ER but honestly I don’t feel like this 24/7, sometimes I feel pretty okay. Needless to say I’ll be talking to my doctor about lowering the dosage and possibly switching medications.

Rest assured I’m not ignoring these symptoms as I’ve already seen my primary care doctor, GI doctor and a colorectal surgeon to have some tests done. I had blood work drawn for labs, an EKG, a stool sample as well as a urine test I’m turning in tomorrow (I couldn’t go during the appointment.) So hopefully that all comes back okay and we can sort this all out. I’m currently taking the 10 milligrams twice a day dose and that’s supposed to end in 2 weeks but hopefully they’ll let me go on a lower dosage sooner. 

So yeah, hard to say if I’ve just been insanely unlucky or this really is all xeljanz’s doing. I’m not saying it’s a bad drug, heck it works pretty well for UC. It’s just if your UC symptoms are really that terrible and you’re doctor thinks it’s in your best interest to risk some of the side effects, at least give it a try, everyone reacts differently after all. For what it’s worth I still think my worst flare was worse than what I’m going through now, I just need to find a happy medium. Sorry for the essay, if anyone else wants to open up with their experiences I think I and everyone else could find comfort to know they’re not the only one dealing with this kind of thing.

Last time I ran It was early june and I did 5x1000m (all under 3m20s) with a bit of anemia... Today my anemia is at 82 (starting to get better) and I ran 2x1000m (first in 4m19s and second in 5m09). It is so weird because when I go out I feel like I can run as fast as usual, my head is ready and I start my run at my normal pace but after 30 seconds the heart starts pumping hard, the legs become heavy and I just can't hold so I slow down. Well, running is very hard especially for people with IBDs but that's what I like, it is very challenging and rewarding. I have to restart from 0 but I have already done it and running is the fastest way for me to get in shape (a little run everyday and if you are not feeling well a run\walk or a simple walk).",2019-07-30 07:04:04

I've had one every year since my cancer surgery (6 years in a row now, plus at first it was every six months) and this time I just about had it.. I'm damn sick of going through this every year.. the fasting, the purgodan, the grouchiness, the caffeine-withdrawal headache.  My hospital is a teaching hospital, so while I'm seeing the same surgeon each year, it's a different intern/nurse who do the scope and this year, it was ROUGH.  And they were up there FOREVER.  And they took like a billion biopsies.

Suck suckitty suck.

Basically my remaining colon (About 10cm worth) has not changed since last year.. which is bad.  Because I had a good amount of inflammation last year.  And I still do.  So my surgeon is concerned and has warned me that if I can't get things under control, I may be looking at more surgery in the near future.

My old specialist that lives near me (My surgeon is in Toronto, I live two hours north) retired without passing me on to someone else, so I'm getting referred to a gastroenterologist.  I've effectively had the shit scared out of me (figuratively speaking) and I've made it my goal over the next 6 months (my next follow up) to do what I can to improve the situation and hopefully take surgery off the table.   I'm still waiting to see what the biopsies bring back as well.  Hopefully nothing.  At least there were no masses or growths to be found.",2019-07-31 03:12:04

Naturally, I haven't had a colonoscopy, but a later visit to a GI has me scheduled for one on 9/11. In the meantime I was prescribed Lialda (2 twice a day).

The first day wasn't a big deal. The second day was something else entirely. After my second dose, I took a nap. I woke up feeling incredibly feverish. I was almost too weak to walk, and couldn't really lift 5lbs very well. Not long after, the nausea hit me. Just a bit of Gatorade Zero had me blasting off from both ends. The fatigue was 90% gone after vomiting.

Now on the third day, I am ruled by bloating, nausea, and pain. I cannot eat anything that isn't moist and soft. Just putting bread in my mouth made me nauseous. I switched from Gatorade to water, and it is still enough to make me very nauseous, if not actually vomit.

The only thing the medication appears to have done, maybe, is dramatically reduce my trips to the bathroom. I was going anywhere from 20 to 30 times a day (10 or less now). There's still blood, still pain, and still liquid or mushy stool. The pain is usually so bad now that it makes the nausea worse while going to the bathroom and results in vomiting.

My attempt at taking my first dose of medication in the morning failed with me vomiting all over the table. I have not been able to take another dose.

How serious is this? Will it pass soon? Should I go to the ER?

UPDATE: Pretty much fell asleep the night this was posted. If I was extremely still, then the terrible symptoms would go away until I moved again.

I woke up to find the feverish and nauseous sensations gone. It's been a few hours now, and I think it's business as usual: bathroom every 40 minutes to an hour.

This is much preferable to what I was going through on the medication. I will still get in touch with my GI and see about alternatives. Thanks to everyone that posted.",2019-09-01 05:22:21

I got diagnosed with severe pancolitis when I was 12, and in 7th grade. It was horrible. I was so sick that we decided I couldnt continue with traditional schooling, so I withdrew from public school and started going to school online. 

For various reasons, I stayed in online school through 10th grade. I was totally isolated for years. I managed to keep one friend. Through her, I met my boyfriend! Things got a lot better for me mentally after meeting him, and, together with my family, I decided I wanted to go back to public school. At this point, I've been in remission for a couple years (shout out to Humira), and it was mostly just anxiety holding me back from re-enrolling to public school. 

So here I am. I'm in 16, in 11th grade, and experiencing school for the first time in years. We had 3 days of school last week, all of which I attended. Its been A LOT harder than I thought. Not academically, but physically. On only the second day of school, I had to go to the nurse because I couldn't stop crying.

I've been having UC symptoms for a couple weeks now after being in remission for years, and I cant tell if its genuine UC activity or if it's just a horrible manifestation of my anxiety. I'm constantly on the verge of tears, and someone looking at me wrong will set me off. Everything I eat makes me sick, either very nauseous or diarrhea. I dont know how to interact with my peers. I dont know how to interact with teachers. I dont know how to sit still for hours at a time. I've had special accommodations set up for me (as that's the law in the US), but I cant just casually leave a class for 45 minutes to shit! People ask questions I cant answer! I dont want complete strangers knowing I have UC, even if it makes them more sympathetic to my situation. My teachers know, but they still question me everytime I have to leave class. 

I feel like I was too hasty in deciding to go back, but I had been sitting on it for at least a year and felt like it was right. Now, I just dont know if I can physically handle it. Between the UC symptoms and my anxiety, I dont think I can do it. But if I cant handle highschool, how the hell am I going to be able to handle the rest of my life? Feels like everything I've been told about this disease not controlling my life is a total lie. If I hadn't gotten it in the first place, I wouldnt be socially inept. It's like I can see everything I've ever looked forward to circling the drain.

thanks for reading this far if you did. Dont really know what my goal is here, but it feels good to get it out.

edit: thank you all so much for the advice and encouragement. I dont know how to respond to all of you without sounding too repetitive, but it really means a lot that you all took your time to read and respond to me. I talked to my parents and I'll be seeing my GI hopefully within the month. I've kind of been avoiding him because he wants me to go back onto azathioprine, which absolutely destroyed me a year or so back. But, if I have to I have to! I've tried anti-anxiety medication before and it didnt help, but that was a couple years ago and I'd be open for trying a different type.

I also started having low grade fever continuously. Then, I noticed a bright red spot on my poop which led to my colonoscopy and the doctor said that I have Ulcerative Proctitis.

My queries are :

1) I have noticed some improvement but not much on this medicine. I still get cramping, pain and tenusmus. Is the dosage too low ? Or will symptoms go away with time ? I have been on Mesacol for 20 days. 

2) I trust my doctor but is there any chance of being misdiagnosed ? I have taken 2nd opinion from another gastroenterologist as well and even he thinks it is Ulcerative Proctitis.

I am very aware of the fact that I am consciously aloof to my situation, but i've just been through so many treatments, medications, and procedures that I think i'm getting exhausted with it and just learning to live with what I have (or just pretending like nothing is wrong at all). Then my anxiety kicks in and reminds me that I could essentially be really harming myself in the long term and possibly even cutting years from my life.... or maybe that's being dramatic.

I was able to go on a beautiful climbing trip to Greece and now I'm back. The first couple of days were pretty hard, I was always tired and my knees hurt a lot, I started rock climbing on the third day and right away my appetite came back and I felt better. Regarding my stools they were all shades of yellow for the entire vacation, sometimes pretty soft and fluffy or greasy, sometimes solid and lumpy. No particular smell, without it I would say, and not absorbed.

Right before departing (three weeks after my first post) I took the calprotectin test, the results came back less than 100 ug/g and reported as negative. Moreover I had other pathogens tested negative as well.

Right now as soon as I eat my guts start making noises and lot of air, stool is not normal but formed, it depends on the day. I go one or two times a day and I can feel some abdominal pain from time to time. Acidity in my stomach is something that appeared recently too.

Monday or Tuesday I will see my GI, he tends to exclude UC  and asked for a colonoscopy only if they find hidden blood in my stool. My concerns are that during the active period I had spondylitis and lower joint pain plus blood, mucus and rectal spams when sleeping. Still have joint pain especially in my toes and knees but from time to time.

At first, I was terrified. I've never had a surgery that big or even had to stay overnight in a hospital. I had my consultation with my surgeon just a few days ago, and he is very optimistic. My husband and friends are also extremely supportive. My mom and aunt, however, are not. They are both nurses and have been telling me I'm going to regret having this surgery. Their argument is that they see people in the hospital where they work that have had nothing but problems since their surgery. They say it's a never ending issue and I'm just opening up a huge can of worms. My rebuttal to that is that they only see the surgeries that fail. They don't see the ones that work and the people that go on to live happy, healthy lives. The surgeon told me that the success rate is 80-90% which are damn good odds for a surgery if you ask me.

I know no one can tell me whether I'm making the right decision or not, but I would love to hear other people's experiences with this surgery. I'm just so tired of being sick. I would rather deal with this surgery and be ""sick"" for a year and have the rest of my life to be happy than live in constant fear of a flare up and cancer for the rest of my life. My mom and aunt both have this disease too but they don't have it as bad as me. Theirs is only rectal. Mine is all the way through my colon.

After a surgery to remove the melanoma the doctors decided that I needed to be on a treatment to control the spread of melanoma in my body. Unfortunately the medication used to treat the melanoma has a side affect of UC for a normal person, but since I’ve already been diagnosed with it, it only infuriated it to the point of being out of control. I’ve exhausted all medication that my gastro knows of and now he wants me to get a second opinion.
Now with all that said, it gets a little worse. I can’t be put back on any biologics to control the flare because of the melanoma and I can’t be put back on the treatment plan to control the melanoma until the flare is under control. I’m currently taking prednisone to control the bleeding (but it’s not working), a control substance to control the diarrhea (that’s not working either), mesalamine (once again not working).

I don’t sleep, I can’t eat or drink anything without being in the bathroom and I can’t do anything in life because this disease is restricting me in every way possible. I try to remain as positive as I can but I’m human and have my limits.

Since my most recent flare, veganism has not been doable, and now I'm more on the Keto side of things (something I never thought I would do ever) I started feeling better and tried going back, but started to flare again. Chicken and greek yogurt seem to be the only things I can eat and feel somewhat normal after. Has anyone else gone through something like this?",2019-09-09 21:39:44

From the colonoscopy report: ""he was found to have evidence of suspected ulcerative colitis, from the cecum to the distal sigmoid colon. His terminal ileum was unremarkable. The endoscopy pictures appeared to be consistent with Mayo 2 colitis.""

I had my first follow up with my GI today who was able to clarify for me that the report meant that there was no involvement with my rectum. My understanding is that UC always starts at the rectum, and works its way back. She explained that in a very small minority of cases, there is rectal sparing UC but there is also a small chance that I have crohn's that's only affecting the colon. Regardless, the treatment for both is the same unless I have small intestine involvement.

So far, the drugs seem to be working and although there are good and bad days, my bad days are 1000 times better than my good days before. The past week I was also able to finally do some back country camping with extensive hiking (between 26-37km/day) which I wouldn't have dreamed of trying a few months ago.

My questions is has anyone heard of this? Is it possible to have UC without rectal involvement as my GI stated?",2019-09-09 20:53:39

2046,After 3 1/2 years back at the hospital,GunterLeGreat,5,d2fngy,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/d2fngy/after_3_12_years_back_at_the_hospital/,0,"So here I am... Back at it again. On saturday I was at my friend's house and we chilled together with some of our friends group. It was a lovely evening /night. We laughed so loudly and so much. 

I was already in a flare since August 2018 and since then I had about 8 to 12 toilet sessions a day. Nothing really worked for me, but I tried to go on and still enjoy life. I met my friends frequently and they are very supportive and understanding. Tried to do sports sometimes a week and go for a walk or do little bike tours. Of course it depends on how my mood was. There were times where I was 3 times a week in the gym and went out for a walk daily and then there were weeks where I didn't go out at all and played video games all day... Not very good for my psych or my overall health situation, I know. But I think the most of you already experienced such ""depression"" phases and also those ""motivationanl and full of power"" times, even tho you have to poop too often a day.

So back to the Saturday night. We all had so much fun and yeah, I may felt a bit worse than usual, but I thought its gonna be fine. Apparently it wasn't fine. On Sunday after lunch it started with pain in my stomach. Im really not used to pain of any kind. I know many of you struggle with pain and cramps in stomach or intestine areas and I have very much respect for you guys, its hard I can imagine. Im very lucky and actually only have diarrhea. Yeah I mean ""only"", like its not enough... And at the same time I started to go pooping every 30mins to one hour. And it was just water. I pooped green or yellow water but no blood (or very rare and only little bit). I lost about 5kg in 3 days just because of pooping water all day long. It's very depressing for a guy who likes to lift weights and want to gain some muscle but hey, Ill get that weight some day back.

And now Im laying in my bed in the hospital. They took blood and decided to start with Prednisone. 100mg...yikes. I really hope it will work for me this time because I hate to have pimples because of Prednisone. My skin is sooo clean right now because I didn't took any medication through my mouth, only Humira via syringes. I already feel better. My stomach pain is nearly gone and I don't have to go to the toilet that often. I hope I can sleep well. Last night I had to run to the toilet about 6 times, because of the water stool it was always very urgent. I also hope I dont have to stay that long in here, because I had some plans. I wanted to meet a friend after a long time. She is also very supportive and would visit me in here, but that's not what I imagined a week ago when we were talking about a nice dinner and talk about everything. But that's life, full of surprises. Even tho they are not always positive.

I always try to see things positive. Like I mentioned in the title. I wasn't in the hospital for three and a half years. I mean I did not had to stay overnight or longer. Only some visits at the doctor and to get my medication. I really do hope that this time it will finally work and I can get my life quality back. We tried so much and also so little. Surgery was already mentioned but Im still skeptical. Maybe only a part of the big intestine? Because I have one part which is constantly inflamed and can't really heal. Maybe we could get rid of it and everything will be better? Without the need to get a stoma/j pouch. I hear many positive things about it, but it's personally for me way too radical. Its like you have lost the fight with CU and I don't want to give up yet. Im only 21 and yes, I already have this illness since 2012. Seven years are not little. I would say 4 1/2 out of the 7 years I could live a normal life without any symptoms or only a little. That means it's possible to get back on that. I really want to achieve that. My family and friends are very supportive and I love every one of them. Knowing that my friends are nearby is also very calming. I literally have two friends who life near by the hospital. If they have time they can come over and we can play some cards. Without them I wouldn't be able to stay strong for so long. They are helping me, pushing me, comforting me and loving me. And I love them back and hope I can help them some day as well. I want to get back to a university or start a job. It's boring to sit everyday at home while your friends are at university or working. I want to feel needed. I want to have responsibilities again. I want, I want, I want AND I WILL!!!

I really don't know what I want to achieve with my post on this sub. Just sharing my story right now and maybe I could motivate some of you do do better than me. Always keep the movement. Try to do sports, at least at home. Go out more. At least for 30min. Dont be scared to shit yourself. Been there, dont that. I have a little trick. I drive with my bike to the nearby forest and in there Im going by foot. If I have to poop I go in the woods or maybe drive back home with my bike. With that you are more flexible and can be faster and dont have to worry about others seeing you. Do more with your friends. Invite them to your place if you are more comfortable with that. Explain them your situation. Tell them everything. If they are decent human beings they will understand you and support you. I can't imagine my life without my friends and family and to feel better and more comfortable I try to tell them about everything.

So yeah. Always stay positive guys and thanks for having you. Reading your stories and seeing the memes here always make me feel like Im not the only one around with UC. Because of you I know, that Im not weird.. Its the fucking illnes we all didn't chose and together we are stronger. I will continue fighting! And sorry for my long post, hope you have a great time and and great poop :)",2019-09-11 00:20:28

So I’ve been on Remicade for the past two years, but my doc agrees that seems like overkill since I don’t have any active disease or other inflammatory symptoms.

Thanks for reading, been following the group for a while since I was diagnosed with UC 4 months ago. Since then been on prednisone in varying doses and pentasa.

Been hospitalised twice in the last 6 weeks due to severe flare ups, and now just completed the induction course of Infliximab. But to be honest nothing seems to be fighting the condition in any long term way. The steroids give me some relief for maybe 8-10 hours after taking them but then at night it’s a nightmare. 

The Infliximab seems to dull things down for a week or so.

Been looking at maybe trying CBD capsules as I’ve read some positive reviews regarding their anti-inflammatory benefits, has anyone in the group any experience with them?

My next step is probably surgery if I can find an effective source of treatment.

Thanks",2019-09-10 12:10:30

I try to stimulate things with coffee in the mornings but it often does nothing. 

Some days I'll feel like I'm almost cured, one or no bowel movements. Other days I'll easily go over 10+. The worst part is there is no in between, it's either 0 or 100. 

This inconsistency has been leading to me developing agoraphobia. Going out for a grocery trip requires extensive planning, and mental preparation. I've had several accidents within the past few months. The majority of the time there is almost nothing but gas, blood, and mucus. 

The urgency I get has gotten to the point that I have to go immediately. I figured out I can pass gas the majority of the time, no leaking somehow, and this will relieve the pressure. Otherwise the pain is so bad I can't even walk. 

I'm on my third biologic, I stopped responding to the other two. Now we're waiting to see if this last one will work. It has been a little over 2 months though, on Xeljanz. I can't tell if I'm seeing improvements, I'm not confident this will work either. I'm not looking to live like this, or make this my new normal, it feels like surgery is right around the corner at this point. I feel like waiting any longer feels like I'm in denial. My GI has had me talk to a surgeon and said we could get a second opinion before we go that route, but Idk. After failing Remicade and Entyvio, I feel like there's little hope. I'm also on mesalamine and max prednisone. Prednisone doesn't seem to be doing any thing for my flare, which before I could see the difference in hours. He's also added mesalamine enemas, prednisone enemas, mesalamine suppositories. The mesalamine products seemed to aggravate my symptoms and the steroid enema doesn't appear to do anything.

This is my first post in this sub. I had symptoms of UC since I’ve been 12 but wasn’t formally diagnosed until I was 17 (by colonoscopy). 

For the most part, my symptoms are relatively mild and I have been able to mange mostly without medication (aside from a year of being on Lialda).

I browse this sub and haven’t really found anyone mention symptoms I can most relate to so I’m curious if anyone can relate here..

I am *extremely* prone to bladder/kidney infections and tend to have to deal with these more than a flare up. I also notice that probably 80% of the time I eat anything (especially a large meal), I don’t really feel pain but just an overall discomfort. It’s as if I can physically feel the food just setting inside my stomach. It’s like a heaviness and often makes me feel fatigued. 

I have had two scopes since my diagnosis, most recent being January of this year and was told I was in ‘remission’ but I really do feel this heaviness in my stomach on a daily basis. Again, not really a pain but just general discomfort and feeling uneasy. I know it may sound like “bloating” but I really don’t think it’s even that. Very hard to describe. Can anyone relate to these symptoms??

Thanks in advance!",2019-09-13 00:31:45

Got on Lialda, have been mostly in remission (some rectal pain on occasion, but other than keeping me awake at night, not a big deal--also a flare in 2018 and 2019). In late 2016, I started having regular neurological and other symptoms: brain zaps, then paresthesia (upper back, lower legs, arms, sometimes face), hip pain, tibia pain, hand pain, R-side scalp pain, ridiculous amounts of sleep required (12-14hrs), and significant quadriceps fatigue (recently, same in my upper arms and shoulder--fatigue after zero exertion) . This year, I've had regular constipation (first in 10 years!). Have seen a neurologist (who ruled out lupus and MS) and finally, an internist. The internist thinks that, just like my kidney stones (4 times now), these symptoms are related to my UC. My lumbar puncture (to rule out MS) was normal. Bloods were pretty unremarkable but showed hypogammaglobulinemia and positive ANA. 

My Q is: Has anyone had similar symptoms? Anyone get an answer? I have a feeling they're autoimmune (I also have rosacea and psoriasis). I know these are not life-threatening symptoms, and I don't think I've got something horrible, but they are SO disruptive.

2074,Success with Xeljanz,DavidTheBarbarian,43,d3sgsh,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/d3sgsh/success_with_xeljanz/,27,"
Just wanted to report that I've had incredible success with Xeljanz.

Entiyvo, remicade, lialda, nothing seemed to work for me.  The best I could get to was high dosages on Prednisone, and still wasn't great.

My Dr was finally telling me to go talk to a surgeon, which I wasn't ready to do.

Last ditch effort, decided to try me on Xeljanz for UC, and holy cow, I feel like I don't even have UC anymore.

It's been 6 months, and I have maybe 2 bowel movements a day, down from 5-10.  No blood anymore, rarely any diarrhea, I feel almost back to normal, something I haven't been able to say in close to a decade.

I spent 12 hours kayaking a few weeks ago, and didn't need a single movement all day

No idea how long this will last, but for the moment, I'm really happy, and finally found something that works for me

Just wanted to share my experience in hopes it'll help someone else as well 

I've even been able to maintain my results with half the dosage (down to 5 daily from 10mg due to the recent black box warning study)

My last C Reactive protein tests showed numbers almost too low to measure successfully, which is one of the biomarkers for inflammation.  My normal values in the past few years have been in the 5-30 range",2019-09-13 19:18:21

Yesterday after my morning movement I experienced no tummy wobbles, no sudden urges to run to the loo during work hours. Usually I'd take 10 minutes every now and again just to be safe, but I didn't need to yesterday, I only sat on the throne twice in the morning.

&#x200B;

Today I'm going to test myself to see if it will last two days in a row. I don't want to get my hopes up too high, but I want to be able to not have something nagging at the back of my head saying ""watch out for your bowels"" over and over.

I failed mesalamines, enemas and suppositories, imuran, uceris, and I've been in a loop of 60mg of prednisone tapers for most of this year with no end in sight.
Humira worked SO well the first month. And then my symptoms would creep back right before my next due date, but now it's constant. I took Humira yesterday but I'm still bleeding and running to the bathroom. I'm miserable to say the least. It hasnt even been 3 months yet.

I know other people have it worse. I know I'm lucky in many ways. But I'm so discouraged today.
I started wearing adult diapers last week. I'm 26. I was perfectly healthy before my UC diagnosis and I just...can't believe that this is my life. Yes, I'm being dramatic, but no I don't care. I need to get this off my chest so I can suck it up and move on.

I hate UC. I hate relying on opioids to get through my day. I hate not being able to eat anything. I hate what all these meds did to my self esteem. I'm balding with adult acne and moonface. The body I worked so hard for is shot from rapid weight loss. I hate my medical bills and my insurance costs and my inability to ask anyone for help. I'm so stubborn and I can't admit to anyone that I need help. I need therapy for all the shit this year has put me through but I can't afford it. I hate hospitals and rude doctors and IVs. I hate that thanks to everything I have severe periodontal disease and my eyesight is awful. I hate how ungrateful I am for my life now and how depressed I've been.

Anyway! Over it. Thanks for letting me vent. Sending love to you all.

EDIT: thanks for all the support yall. I usually mention my gender in posts but didn't (I'm a girl!), so all the ""dude"" comments made me laugh in the midst of feeling shitty lol.

Trigger warning pregnancy loss mentioned. 

I was first diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in 2010 and took about 2 years to get myself under control and into remission with a couple hospital stays from losing too much blood while going to the bathroom. I was in remission from 2013-2015 with a couple days here and there where my Colitis didn't like certain foods I ate. I had a really bad flare up with my first pregnancy and each one after that. After I had my daughter my symptoms pretty much went away soon after labour and was in remission until my second pregnancy. 

I am currently 30w3d dealing with constant pain, cramping, and bathroom breaks during my pregnancies, this is my 3rd pregnancy. I seem to always flare up once I conceive I can almost pin point it to the date of conception because that's when my symptoms start happening. I have tried so many different medications, this time they now have me taking Remicade. My first pregnancy was successful and I got my beautiful daughter, my second pregnancy ended with a still born boy at 37w1d. They don't know the cause of the loss but they are watching me very closely this time and I'm just having such a hard time physically, emotionally, and mentally. I am however very lucky to have a very supportive husband who helps me anyway he can. 

I guess the purpose of my post is for advice if you've been through this how did you deal with it or just to know I'm not alone. I don't anyone else with colitis or anyone dealing with this while pregnant. Thank you for just reading my post!",2019-09-17 02:44:26

Recently was hospitalized for severe diarrheas, was not taking my medications (Asacol), almost 2 weeks of 7 + diarrheas per day. Crazy. When I got out of the hospital I was prescribed 6 tablets 800 mg Asacol per day + 20 mg Prednisone, tapering off by 1/2 per week. So, no I’m on 6 tablets Asacol 800 mg + Prednisone 5mg. I suspect I needed to stay a little longer on higher doses of Prednisone. I am honestly tired. Any thoughts, recommendations? Appreciated.",2019-09-19 00:48:19

I'm looking to see if anyone else has had success with just mesalamine after using prednisone.

Left side UC. I have been on a standard mesalamine dose (Lialda) for 3 years, flared once in Jan 2018. Had my worst flare so far in July. Uceris worked fast last year to stop the flare but not this time. Had a flex sig and they put me on 40 mg prednisone, tapering 10mg weekly. Symptoms were wiped out in 2 days!

Now, my GI is telling me he thinks it's pointless to go back on Lialda even at a stronger 4.8 mg dose as he sees many people flare again after getting off steroids. He is recommending I start Entyvio. I guess I'm hesitant to jump to Entyvio because the pred worked so fast and it still seems like my UC is minor and could be controlled with Lialda.

Down >20lbs, weighed 81lbs when I got to the hospital. After hospital stay number 2, I was a miserable blob at home. Still lots of BMs with blood, then I started having lots of nausea and daily vomiting. I could only eat when I took pain meds. Two and a half weeks after hospital visit 2, I returned for hospital visit 3 after a work in appointment to see my GI. 

Now I'm on TPN (I may go home with it, so far my insurance has approved it). Started on a clear liquid diet. When I went to a full liquid diet (creamy soups, pudding), i had more pain, more BMs, more blood. Today I went back down to clear liquids. The GI here was going to switch me to oral steroids today from IV, but last night I had a ton of pain and bloody BMs after eating the full liquids, so we opted to stay on the IV steroids for now and take it day by day. (I'm very grateful because after my last hospital stay they started to taper me way too quickly and I'm sure that contributed to my issues).

I'm just sad and frustrated. I WANT to eat. I love food. I love to cook. I want to WANT food. But it just rips up my inflamed colon and makes me feel like shit. Even something simple like creamy soups have left me feeling like garbage. It's messing with my head. 

Today we made the decision to start Xeljanz, which is my last resort before surgery (I have failed Entyvio most recently, everything else over time). It has just been months of misery for me at this point and the most painful flare ever and it seems never ending. I take 2 steps forward and one step back. I miss food. I miss cooking. I miss my normal body. I know you guys have been here and you sympathize. I have been at this point before and bounced back but this time it seems worse as my drug choices have run out. My whole life has broken down over the past 2 years, with this flare coming to a head since the beginning of this year or so. 

And now I just sorta stare at my bowl of chicken broth and sometimes I'm like... can't the TPN handle this for me? But at the same time I don't want to give up food all together, even if it's just some boring ass liquid. 

Anyway. Please vent to me your experiences with food, TPN, your garbage guts, hospital stays, IVs that won't stop beeping, whatever it is that's bothering you. Also, if you have Xeljanz experience (positive or negative), please tell me about it!",2019-09-19 03:33:35

I pretty quickly went into remission after going onto Lialda. Three years ago, while still in remission, I started experiencing brain zaps, then more and [more symptoms (detailed here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/d3cac8/i_have_uc_but_are_these_nonuc_symptoms_related/). Never once did one of three doctors say to me ""extraintestinal manifestations"" or mention they might be related to my UC. Docs were exploring neurological (maybe MS, ugh). Then I see a new doc (internist) a week ago, and he says it may be the UC. Then I come home and google and see allllll the so-called EIM symptoms. Dammit! How did no one bring this up until three years later? Not only did they not bring up that these symptoms might be due to UC, but they also didn't tell me I'm more at risk (significantly) for stroke or DVT, bone issues, MS, etc.

So now, my brain is on fire. I went from being pissed off for not being told all this, to in awe of my body's every system being affected by this one disease (I mean WOW), to a feeling of: Okay, this is life, so now I know. And it's not a relief but a matter of saying to myself that basically, after having the disease for 10+ years, I am indeed at risk of a multitude of things getting worse or developing. But I got lucky: I was diagnosed at age 40, while many others are teens when they're diagnosed. It really puts the next 1/10/20 years in perspective. I've scaled back work (from 60 hrs/wk)--not because my symptoms, though now I doubt (between the excessive sleep and major muscle fatigue) I could work even 40. 

So now I'm crystal clear: I work enough to pay for my travel, and screw saving for retirement. I'm not gonna be that person who doesn't spend while they're young and healthy, only to have a tragedy occur and life ends before it begins. No way--not happening. What if my constantly aching hands soon get so bad I can't type anymore? What if my painful hip joints make me unable to walk much/at all? I would be so mad at myself if I screwed up this chance at life.

So for a bit of a background on my diagnoses and  few months of living with Ulcerative Colitis, check my other Reddit posts out. (I've also put up a few rants about the journey if that interests you) 

I was on Asacol for around 4 months with the dose going up and down but it was making me worse. I've been put on Steroids which are working miracles and am now on my second dose of them to keep the Colitis under control while changing from Asacol to Azathioprine. The Calcium tablets are pretty tasty too which is a bonus

I went to see the IBD Nurse a few days ago and she's started me on a drug called Azathioprine which is an immunopressant. I've read a few things about it on the Chrones And Colitis UK website. Based on the information it seems like there's a lot to think about in regards to side effects and everything. With weekly blood tests for Liver function and one for Kidney function it seems like something that is going to do more harm than good, or maybe this is just a precaution. There's also an increased risk of skin cancer and a few other things which are a little bit concerning.

I've spent a few days reading the information and have taken my first dose today so here starts the road to remission in around 12 weeks when it hopefully starts to take affect. What is everyone else's experience on Azathioprine, my Uncle has Colitis and is on Anti Rejection drugs but I've read that this is basically the same thing.",2019-09-23 23:23:09

I found this sub to share what has done absolute wonders for me. I'm sure others have probably wrote posts about this before but I really do hope it can bring some relief to others symptoms and flare up's.

My first severe flare up was at 16. After ignoring the symptoms for almost a year I was finally hospitalized as nothing seemed to help. Massive IV doses of prednisone (the go to for everything) did absolutely nothing for me. After refusing to have an operation I asked for a second opinion. Remicade saved my life. From one day to the next I could see some improvements. I was on Remicade for almost 8 years before I decided to stop it and see if I could manage my UC without it even though I was still getting intermittent flare up's. The side effects and fatigue I experienced with Remicade was too much of a hydrance to my career and goals that I needed to achieve. I went off cold turkey and haven't had it since. It has now been 4 years. After experiencing a bunch more flare up's and trying everything natural under the sun thinking I wouldn't find anything I found Turmeric. To my grand surprise it felt like it had the same almost overnight success that Remicade did.

After playing with doses and different brands that sold Turmeric gel caps  I found what was for me the sweet spot and honestly continues to be a life saver to this day. It has brought me back from fairly severe flare ups in less than a week's time.

Two ""Jamieson""9,000mg Ultra strength raw herb Turmeric gel caps a day before bed. A few hours after eating. I don't know if the brand is worldwide since I am in Canada.

Any other lesser concentration of Turmeric in gel caps have not helped me but as soon as I found the ultra strength ones it has truly been a game changer.

My calprotectin (it was 17.4) and other inflammation markers came back as normal.  No C-Diff, parasites, etc.  My Urea Nitrogen was a little low and my protein was low.  My liver numbers are on the high side but it's been that way since I my Imuran moved up to 150mg (I've been on 200mg for a long time now).  The odd thing I find my protein being low is that I had been eating a lot of protein around then.  Like a lot.  I normally don't eat a lot of meat but I was on a trip where it was safest for me to eat meat so that's what I mainly consumed so that is really weird to me.

So my symptoms have been blood in my stools, going to the toilet around 6 times a day. Having mucus in my stool and sometimes just pooping mucus. Sometimes some slight pain in my lower left abdomen.  I do have the urge to go to the toilet quite a lot as well. This has been going on now for about 2-3 months as well.

However I am finding that I dont have watery diarrhoea and my poos are formed but soft. Which seems to be quite odd as everything I read about UC mentions diarrhoea. So I was wondering if you guys this this could be UC? Or could it be something else? I know I need a camera to say for sure but as mentioned Im having to wait a while for it to be confirmed.",2019-09-25 13:19:42

But does anyone else notice the differences in smell?

My farts don't really smell anything when I'm in remission.

But I feel like when a flare-up is a coming or when I'm in the early stages of a flare and I still have the ability to bloop air out of my booty, it smells horrrrendous.

2205,How often do flare-ups happen? What to eat? What to do for exercise?,misterkevian,2,d8zxmi,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/d8zxmi/how_often_do_flareups_happen_what_to_eat_what_to/,1,"Hello folks. I'm new to Reddit, and I've also just been diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (Pancolitis version) earlier this year. I've experienced three flares up so far: first in February (misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis by first doctor), second one around May (where I finally got a colonoscopy and diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis by my now GI), and I'm going through my third bout now. I would say I'm a bit used to it now, but I'm still coming into terms with this disease, how to live with it, what to do to ease the pain and occurrence of flare-ups etc.  

1. Do flare-ups happen this much? I'm not entirely sure how many times I have to go through a flare-up during a course of a year. I'm taking medication now, and it should help alleviate the symptoms and keep me in remission, but, so far, it seems to come back rather quickly. Is there anything I can do to keep myself in remission longer besides taking my medication religiously?
2. I understand that diet changes during a flare-up and in remission. Right now, since I'm flaring up, I'm limiting myself to basically just soft foods like white rice, some soups, peanut butter, crackers, bananas etc. But during remission, what should I eat in order to keep myself from flaring-up less often? I've heard that this differs from person to person, but is there a general consensus within the UC community as to what foods tend to trigger flare-ups?
3. Prior to my diagnosis, I'd like to consider myself as a rather active person. I usually go to the gym three times a week for weight lifting. After being diagnosed, I averted the gym during flare-ups and went back again to resume my usual gym schedule once I felt better. Does exercise at all affect my chances of going through flare-ups? I was thinking that maybe all that weight lifting could be potentially causing my flare-ups because of the pressure I'm applying to my abdomen and due to how vigorous it is in nature. But I also read that weightlifting is good for UC in order to strengthen my bones since osteoporosis is a possible symptom of UC later on. I would really like to continue weight lifting because it is the exercise I enjoy the most, but what do you all think about this?

Your answers are very much appreciated. Thank you all, in advance, for taking the time and sharing what you know. Have a wonderful day :)",2019-09-25 09:28:06

Needless to say, I've been extremely paranoid and stressed from watching him suffer my whole life. I have been trying to stay on top of managing my symptoms. I have Canasa suppositories, but no oral medication.

I recently switched to a new GI, and she performed another colonoscopy today after my symptoms and flares have become more severe over the past 6 months. 

She says I have a new patch of inflammation near my appendix, which was one of the areas she biopsied. It seemed like this was not very normal, by the way she was talking. 

I was still a little out of it so I didn't ask as many questions as I should have. I do see her again in a few days once the biopsy results come back.

Was taken off it when I found out I was pregnant and the UC has thankfully been quiet - until now.

I have already been suffering with severe, non-stop Hyperemesis - throwing up up to 10+ times each day, dehydration etc - since week 6 of this pregnancy. So the return of bloody diarrhoea and stomach pain this week on top of everything is... a lot. 

I was put back on Prednisolone (cortisone) today and will taper off to 10-15 mg a day until baby is born in hopefully a bit over a month. After that it’s back on Entyvio.

Disclaimer, this is from a male's experience.

For the past year I've been on a flare. Many of us become afraid of our farts, with good reason.  It is important that we fart whenever possible, without going on the toilet to do so. I did this for so often that my ass forgot what farts and shits felt like. I've discovered that 90% of the time it's gas I need to pass. I've held my farts for so long it causes my anus to spasm and I end up shitting myself if I try to hold it. So, I need to fart the moment I feel it. I know there isn't much of an option for this next part, but we can't be holding our bowel movements so often either. Let me explain what has happened to me as a result.

It seems I have developed **Pelvic floor dysfunction.**  I'm an anxious person, tense, nervous, and even have tremors. Holding in bowel movements for a year, and never farting unless on a toilet, seems to be the cause. Think about when you clench your anus, how tight the entire area becomes. Your pelvic muscles will forget how to relax. Now this is only a self diagnosis for now until I can see my GP. My GI thinks it's caused by inflammation but I've never had these symptoms before. 

My entire pelvic area is so tense and sensitive, at times the pain becomes excruciating. The pain can extend anywhere from my lower back to the tip of my penis. A lot of the day I spend laying on my side to get the pain to subside. Sex and masturbating provide a moment of relief as it causes the muscles to relax, but then they go right back. Breathing exercises help, but again I've never been good at relaxing so I have a long ways to go. The unhealthy way is to get drunk and relax that way, or go to sleep for the majority of the day.

 Now lets talk about what this has done to my sex life. Because of this dysfunction I had the pleasure of learning about **Hard Flaccid**. This might sound like an oxymoron, but it is real and real painful. Your penis never goes entirely flaccid, has a rubbery feeling to it. It's harder to maintain an erection. May lead to premature ejaculation. And your glands don't fill up as well during an erection (the head of your penis).

I know, holding in bowel movements is necessary and trusting farts is dangerous. But, this pain has been worse than any pain caused by my colitis. This is coming from someone with severe colitis over my whole colon. My pelvic area becomes so tight that I can't walk, I can't sit, and passing stools is excruciating. It leaves me sweating and on the verge of passing out. 

Here's a post that talks about hard flaccid, if you want to see if you have any of these symptoms. No, I don't believe in nofap but I found it through a google search and thought the post was good.

Just looking for any advice/support from anyone who has been in a similar situation.

5 Months ago the way I discovered I had ulcerative colitis was because it caused me to have a miscarriage.   I was so happy and pregnant and everything was right in the world.  Then the endless trips to the restroom started.  I was told it was just my body's reaction to changing hormones. It wasn't. The baby died, and the excessive urgency and bathroom trips continued.  Then came the blood.  Then finally I was diagnosed two months later.  A sad, depressed 31 year old who thought I had dodged this ""family curse.""    The doctor started me on pentasa but wouldn't give me prednisone, even though that is the only thing that worked for my mother and sister who have been diagnosed for years.  Also, I am an American expat who lives in Japan so that's like a whole other stress between me and my doctors (I can speak Japanese but there are medical cultural differences).   Anways, the pentasa took my flare from moderate/severe to mild/moderate for a while.  But now it's full on awful again.  I called the hospital and they agreed to see me on Tuesday with a ""specialist.""  I am going to demand to be put on prednisone.  I'm just really sick of this.  I want to start a family. I thought I was going to but now this stupid disease is ruining my life.  I can't try to conceive again during this flare, or the baby will probably die again.  I'm lethargic and sluggish.  I'm in pain and losing blood.  I just want to be normal again!

&#x200B;

 Ok sorry to complain so much.  I know you all have this too.  No need for my pity party.  Does anyone here have pregnancy success stories with UC or advice for next time ?  Any other expats living in Japan with UC?  Just feeling really down today.  Thanks for reading!",2019-09-28 05:10:42

Which, as far as I can tell is at odds with all mainstream information, including, CDC, Mayo Clinic, NIH, etc. etc.

TL;DR: Have had UC for at least 10 years. Diagnosed 6 years ago. Have had several gastroenterologists, none of whom suggested any other diagnosis. As well I have most of the classic symptoms. However, just visited a new GI the other day. He insists on a flexible sigmoidoscopy, though I had a colonoscopy a few months ago. His reason? He doubts UC diagnosis, because ""Pain is not something that is typically associated with Ulcerative Colitis."" Worth noting that he represents himself as an expert/specialist in Crohns and UC.

My spouse was in the room with me, and verifies that this is what was said. I interacted with him through his offices' portal, and got him to basically reiterate the statement. So it's not in doubt. Did not seem like a dude who really gave much of a shit about anything. Kind of seems like, ""have an expensive procedure or GTFO.""

Basically, my knees are kinda fucked. 

I took prednisone for almost four years during my teen years. You can go on my prior posts and figure out how old I am or whatever. I was gradually tapered down from 40mg of the stuff. The first month when I was off prednisone was terrible. My hormones were crazy. I was barely eating, and my knees were hurting randomly. 

Right now I’m on a low dose of budesonide. As of the past week my knees have been hurting a lot more than normal. I can’t even walk more than half a mile at a normal pace without them hurting. 

I know that prednisone increases the chances of arthritis and other issues, but I’m young!

2254,Pentasa experiences?,bayesismybae,2,dbi363,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/dbi363/pentasa_experiences/,6,"So after a summer of remission I've fallen into a flare 3 weeks ago, and for the first time I am using Pentasa tablets and enemas to try and get the flare to subside.

I'm wondering what everyone else's experiences are with Pentasa, because as far as I can tell it isn't really doing much for my urgency and there is still a reasonable amount of blood droplets after 3 weeks of daily usage (1 enema + 4 x 1g pill). My main question is whether anyone had to remain on this longer in order to get an effect?

&#x200B;

some more backstory:

My case of UC is relatively mild, and I have been prescribed Salofalk enemas in the past which were absolute lifesavers as they worked the day after taking the first dose, so my experience with the Pentasa is quite disappointing. I last saw my GI in the summertime after I had induced remission with the Salofalk enemas (my last refill from my prior GI) and he prescribed me the Pentasa to use until my next check up which is in 2020.

I'm very stubborn and my desire to live drug-free caused me to not take the Pentasa at all while in remission. This worked for about 4 months of reckless eating, drinking, and stress. As soon as I saw the blood return 3 weeks ago I started taking the drugs as prescribed. I can't say I notice any improvement, especially with regards to the urgency which is the truly disabling part. I have also quit consumption of added sugars for about 1 week now, will see how that goes since I had a huge problem with eating excessive amounts of sugar.",2019-09-30 22:52:21

2266,An update on highschool,edgyledgy,5,db4hzr,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/db4hzr/an_update_on_highschool/,3,"a few of you asked me to keep the sub updated with my situation from my previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/cysctb/highschool/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share so I thought I'd make one, since it's been quite a while!

first off I just wanna say thanks again to everyone that commented on the last post with advice or encouragement. It really helped me, and I find myself rereading the comments when I need to. So! Thanks so much!

so, recap: 16 year old girl, junior in highschool, been doing online school for four years due to UC diagnosis. went back to public school about a month ago and was really anxious, along with sick. hopefully that refreshes the memory lol

As for school, things have gotten better! I've been in school a month now, and my anxiety is a lot lower. I'm pretty sure that what I thought couldve been a flare was just anxiety, which I'm really thankful for. I'm feeling a lot better in the digestion department now. I still have rough days where I'll just be nauseous for no reason, or all poopy for no reason, but it's nothing none of us cant handle :)

While my anxiety is a lot better, it's definitely still there. I can hardly talk to people. If my boyfriend brings someone new to sit with us at lunch, I literally will not be able to speak until they're gone. Its so pathetic, I'm so scared of other people. I dont even know why? That's just how social anxiety is, I guess. Something I can definitely tell you guys, though, is that it really sucks to be the sick kid! That's the reputation that I retained despite being gone for 4 years. I could probably have a cooler reputation, but no, I have to be the kid that everyone feels bad for. Total cliche, I know, but I really hate the sympathetic looks/questions/comments I get. I don't think it ever really got out that I had UC, but its still pretty awkward feeling like a lot of people only want to talk to you to make themselves feel better. Anyways, I want to make friends. I really do. But I cant talk to people in a school setting. For example, I went to the hoco game with my boyfriend, and afterward we met up with a couple of his friends, which gave me a bit of anxiety, but no where near to what it's like at school. Outside of people at school, though, my anxiety is pretty good. I dont freak out every morning anymore, I dont panic walking to class, I dont feel trapped in my classrooms, all good things. I talked to my GP about treating this, and he said that he wouldnt recommend an SSRI for this anxiety, since it really only happens when I'm expected to interact with people. Which isnt a situation I'm in a lot. So, I'm not really sure what to do. On top of all this, my therapist of 2 years is moving to a different city, so I have to find a new one, which is super stressful.


One thing I dont think I mentioned in the previous post that I was also worried about was germs. Having a compromised immune system in a school full of teenagers that would rather die of the flu in the hallways than miss a day of homework is not a good combination! I've yet to get really sick, but someone mustve coughed in my general direction; I've had a cold for like 3 weeks and it's super annoying. I'm very scared of getting the flu, but I got my vaccine and bullied my friends into getting theirs, too (lol), so hopefully I'll be alright. Not looking foreward to the inevitable months of having a cold, though.

So.... yeah. I think that's it. Sorry most of this post is more so about anxiety than UC, but that's how things are. The UC put me in the situation that made me develop such terrible anxiety, so it's related lol. Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance to anyone that comments :)",2019-09-30 03:36:34

my ""loading doses"" went thusly: first infusion in february, 2 weeks later second infusion, 4 weeks later third infusion. As of right now, I'm supposed to take my fourth infusion on tuesday 6/4.

Specialist did anoscopy, confirmed internal hemmies, sent me away with cream that cleared it up. Came back 6 months later, used cream, again, cleared up instantly. Fast forward to two months ago, came back with a vengeance, no cream worked. Started to think more was going on, went to new specialist and demanded colonoscopy, and UC was diagnosed. This was friday, so 2 days ago.

The doctor didn't tell me much, gave me a print out and told me I have UC in 40cm of colon, and told me I should do some research. I was pretty groggy so I didn't push for more info, thank god my wife was there and got testy with him because he didn't even say UC, just ""inflammation,"" until my wife pressed him. Anyway, he prescribed me Apriso and Prednisone, scheduled me for a follow-up a month from now, and sent me on my way.

Here is where my story is interesting. I have never had any abdominal cramping at all, for which I am extremely thankful for. My only symptoms have been diarrhea, blood, and mucus, which is why I was so convinced it had to be a hemmi. So I had been on a very high fiber diet leading up to the scope, and since 3 days prior to the scope had basically 0 bleeding and I had fully formed stools. Following the scope/meds, my stools are still mostly formed and less frequent, but the bleeding is back and more dramatic.

Has anyone experienced this before? Is this just an adjustment period with the meds, or could could the scope have aggravated something?

Side note: for anyone curious, while I was doing the very high fiber I was also consuming a good deal of bone broth. I noticed at one point when I stopped the bone broth my bleeding came back bad, but when I started again it stopped. Hopefully that info helps someone out there get their UC under control.",2019-06-03 03:49:27

I’ve (26F) been diagnosed for around 5 years fluctuating from mild to moderate UC throughout my colon. I take mesalamine, however, I notice the most difference in my overall well being and symptoms when I eat clean, exercise and manage stress. I haven’t always been great at keeping a healthy diet (too much drinking and Taco Bell in my early 20s) which is when my symptoms flare up the most.

At my last gastro appointment/last scoping a few months ago, my Dr. suggested I start on Entyvio. I have a really hard time committing to something as invasive as a regular infusion treatment, when I feel very well managed with diet. And by well managed I mean about 3 (give or take) soft, but not liquid bowel movements a day with some short bouts of cramping if I accidentally eat something that my body does not like. 
My Dr. keeps insisting that there’s not much of a link to diet and colitis symptoms management. 

I’ve eaten vegetarian my whole life. And for the past 3-4 months I’ve stayed away from fast food and processed food in general. I try to cook for myself as much as I can instead of going out. Minimize alcohol, especially really heavy beers (I tend to be fine with just a couple glasses of wine). Minimize, but not totally eliminate dairy and really spicy foods. I have some problem vegetables like broccoli and beets that I also try to stay away from. 

Altering my diet like this, and being consistent with it has made me feel better than any medication ever has.

I obviously know that infusions like Entyvio can bring a lot of necessary relief to those living with a more painful and intense form of UC and I’m not trying to denounce my Drs. professional advice.

I’d love to hear some of your experiences with managing mild/moderate UC symptoms from a diet perspective.


EDIT: Wow thanks for all the responses!!! One of the most frustrating things about UC is the last of concrete, hard line solutions. Symptom management varies so much person to person. Seems like its safe to say diet can definitely help to manage some symptoms but it may not be safe for everyone to rely solely on that. I really appreciate everyone sharing what they found helps them. It brings me comfort to have a support group that really understands what dealing with UC is like (you can only get so much sympathy from non UC friends and family).  Happy pooping y'all! :)",2019-06-04 14:39:30

My 8 year old son was diagnosed with UC about 10 months ago. He initially contracted a bacterial infection, plesiomonas shigelloides, that we are told somehow paved the way for UC. His initial flare landed him in the hospital. Symptoms were the typical bloody/mucus/loose stools about 20 times a day and through the night. He was placed on prednisone and a lot of other drugs, the main one being methotrexate. He responded well over the next couple of months, and his poops got semi normal (back to 1 to 2 a day, no blood/mucus and formed - though not as firm as I would like). We weened him off prednisone and were in the process of weening him off metho. Then last week happened...

Day after a swim meet he had blood in his stool. Then a second poop same day with more blood, the bright red kind. We sent in stool sample and are still waiting for results. Over the next few days, stools were kind of formed and not real frequent (no more than 2 a day) and only had a trace of blood (now in the poop and not on the paper or the water). Another swim meet last night, and today another bloody poop, bright red/lots in the bowl. Poop is a lot of little formed pellets.  Thankfully, throughout all of this he’s never had any real pain (even during the initial flare), only complaining of a tummy ache maybe two times (and not currently). 

So, this sucks. Also, questions for those of you further down this road than I am:

1. Is it possible to have symptoms like this without being in a flare?

2. Anybody ever hear of swallowing lots of pool water as driving symptoms?  He is 8, and said he swallowed a lot of water in some of the events. 

3. I hear people say their UC is mild or moderate or severe. What drives those distinctions?

4. What are your thoughts on the cause of flares in general. In other words, do they always have to have some trigger, or can they happen for no real reason?

Maybe dumb questions. Just trying to make sense of some of this.",2019-06-05 20:30:53

(3 or so years Ulcerative colitis, on Entyvio and Mesalamine currently) Back again with another ‘fun’ medical mystery. So about a month ago, had really intense pain at a concert right below my rib on my front side where I’ve had some bad ulceration in the past. Still waiting for the official results from Entyvio, but symptomwise looking more and more like I’m out of any sort of remission. Called my doc and got started on a prednisone taper - not fun but oh well.

That being said, a brand new symptom has developed thats got me incredibly concerned, as I’ll be going out of the country for two weeks in two weeks. About a week ago, i started feeling some pressure in my middle right abdomen (just below the rib cage). Over the course of a day or two, the pressure spread to my back. I was on a business trip but went ahead and got an ultrasound of my gallbladder and liver at the request of my doc - all looked good there.

That being said, anyone ever experience something similar? The pain/pressure has reduced since then, but especially in my back I am still in a fairly constant state of discomfort/minor distension. Could this be a stricture? A hernia? Something to wait out? I have already seen my gastro twice in a month, and am currently finishing up all the bloodwork/etc from the aforementioned flare up a month or so back. He did not seem too concerned and said we’d probably just have to change my biologic after I get home in July. Do I go back a third time to try and prevent my overseas trip from ending in disaster? I usually try to see him as little as possible, but the idea of feeling like this on a 14 hour flight is terrifying.

If so, how did it go?

I searched for a long time to find a good quality turmeric supplement. But I noticed it kind of caused softer stools. I didn't realise that 4500 mg a day was a bit too much. Lol.
Anyways, even cutting back to the recommended dose still gives me a bit of discomfort.

I have then used turmeric supplements solved in coconut oil for enemas. It works fantastic (two dissolved pills per 60mg coconut oil.) 

However I was wondering if juicing it and drinking it would be more appropriate than the supplement. I know it wouldn't be as ""potent"" as a lab created supplement, but might be more absorbed by the body in it's natural form.

My next plan will be adding some juiced turmeric into the coconut oil.


Regarding the coconut oil, in have to say the times I used it it gave me weeks at a time of no symptoms of blood or pain or colitis.
Only problem is if you don't eat much, then the oil can take a few days to vacate  and you have to be careful passing gas.",2019-06-06 19:48:29

I was diagnosed with left sided colitis in 1991, was on Sulfasalazine for a year or so and then Mesalazine.

In and out of hospital, Prednisolone via IV, Prednisolone Orally 2-3 times a year for months at a time.

Last year had another colonoscopy showing full colitis (pan colotis), Prednisolone had stopped working and I was faced with surgery. I tried SCD Diet, low FODMAP diet, Paleo diet. I tried VSL#3 and Symprove probiotics. Some success, but still very ill.

Most of the time I was going to the toilet 6-8 times a day, when very bad, much more and would just stop eating :(.

Some of the diets slowed things down, but I was still pooping a few times daily.

Obviously for most of this time (except when on pred) I am tired, fatigued and have muscle joint pain.

Fast forward to this week. I read some old articles on an imbalance between Omega 3 and Omega 6 being a possible cause in UC and possibly CD. Read various medical journals and decided to;

1. Increase Omega 3 intake (eating mackerel and sardines 2-3 tins per day)
2. Decrease Sunflower/rapeseed oil/butter, swapping to olive oil.

The rise in use of Soybean/sunflower/corn oil and the increase in incidense of UC is uncanny.

Result of 1 + 2 above?

I HAVE NOT POOPED IN 4 (FOUR) days.

I feel like I have some energy (not a lot, but some).

I realised that just before I got bad in 1990 my dad had a heart attack in 1989. As a family we 100% switched from butter to margerine and swapped from Lard for frying to Sunflower oil. Coincidence? maybe, anyway, I am on the low Omega 6 train and I aint getting off!

Apparently the ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 is the imporant bit, it used to be 1:1, these days its 20:1

&#x200B;

Wondering if many here have experienced acute pancreatitis on 5-ASAs after taking them for a while.  

I had been going OK on 4g oral Pentasa (Mesalazine) and 2g rectal since January, though still not able to eat a wide range of veges or other high fiber foods, but no pain and was feeling pretty good.

About 3 weeks ago I developed pain in my left upper abdo which radiates around to my back, kind of stabby/gnawing pain which is almost constant.  Bloods came back with slightly elevated liver function (had prev been normal) and elevated lipase (not dramatic, about 3x the normal range).  Had a CT scan which showed likely pancreatitis in the tail bit, Ultrasound showed gallbladder etc OK.  I haven't touched alcohol in 18 months, and have a very low fat diet last few weeks.

Convinced my GP today to let me stop the Pentasa for a few days to see if it helps, but I'm so scared of stopping it!  Anyway - anyone had a similar story with 5-ASA's?  

Oh and I'm not under a Gastro Dr as I'm still waiting for appt - publicly funded health isn't always great!",2019-06-07 06:11:19

I feel bad (I know it gets better once diagnosed) kind of scared but what can you do?

I’m a really anxious person I’ve found out after quitting my job to go back to school, and moved in with my gf and working a new job that’s physically demanding. I’m 26 and very stressed out. Probably doesn’t help the UC.

*Some gross details but I’m sure ya’ll heard them all*

Anyways, you all seem to have severe symptoms like multiple bowl movements In a day and blood. I have not  (knock on wood) I poop once a day in the morning and coffee seems to solidify my poop, maybe cus it dehydrates it? Idk. But alcohol will give me diarrhea for a day which I thought was normal but I guess it’s not. Also every now and then I’ll get a poop that’s all shredded looking and sometimes see foods in them like carrots, mushrooms, beans, peanuts.
Zero pain as far as day to day things. I’ve been fighting anal fissures off and on tho and that does bring slight pain. Only really get them if I don’t drink enough water through the day.

 Can I ask you guys what a specific flare up is like, so I will know what to look for? (More detailed the better even if it’s gross)

I went to the doctor a few months ago because I had a streak of loose  stool and rectal bleeding (anal fissures) my doctor said don’t worry about it and give it a month, well it didn’t get better so they had me get a colonoscopy. 

When they were in there they didn’t see anything bad, but I just got a call and my test results back saying I have UC. I must have a mild case because reading some of these post and comments makes me scared it might get worse or makes me feel better I don’t have it worse. Very mixed feelings at this point and writing this all out kind of makes me feel a little better.

I think having a community to ask questions and talk to is so awesome!

So for years, my flair ups were contained by a simple routine of Prednisone for a few weeks and it would be over, maybe once per year. This year it didn't work. My doctor prescribed Uceris as a final option instead of suggesting Humira, Remicade or some other biologic.

In 10 days I was totally better, flair up over. I was having regular firmer movements what were at a normal frequency. When I called my doctor after about 2 weeks to give him an update, he was pleased to see that I was better and suggested that since the Uceris was successful in treating the flair up, to stay on it indefinitely. I was weary about this since I knew the Prednisone was not something to stay on for a long time and did not want to deal with the typical long term steroid side effects. He assured me that it was different since unlike the Prednisone, Uceris does not absorb into the blood.

Well now it's almost 8 weeks since starting and I'm still on my prescribed 3 pills per day. Flair up is still under control but I'm starting to notice some of the listed side effects. With all the reading, I haven't found any articles suggesting its okay to stay on for more than the 8 weeks.

Has anyone or is anyone currently taking Uceris, that has been on for longer than 2 months? How was your experience of taking it for a long time? What was your doctors reasoning for leaving you on it? Conversely, what was the reason for making sure you were off by the end of the 8 weeks?",2019-06-11 22:28:50

Just finished my colonoscopy and found I am in the top 20% worse UC my doc has seen. Pretty fun. my beautiful bowels are full of ulcers, and he said they cover the entire colon. 

Anyways, just coming to terms with the fact this is my life now, my goal is to go into remission naturally with a good diet. All the terrible things I've read and mountains of horrendous side effects do not appeal to me at all. I was just prescribed Lailda and it's side effects (even the common ones) sound worse to me than shitting all the time. 


Should I just take the meds? I am a super duper novice obviously and just really looking for your expertise. 

Are there any things I need to know that you all wished you knew when you were first diagnosed? Any resources? I hear the UC is a disability and there are some ""benefits"" from work, government, etc that are available, so any information would be great.

I’ve been dealing with nearly constant loose stools and blood in the toilet for probably 9 months or more. If it’s not diarrhea, it’s constipation. 

My GP had my bloodwork done and since we suspect IBD, sent me a referral for a colonoscopy, which I have scheduled for next week. Bloodwork came back saying I’m SEVERELY anemic, so doc recommended taking 325mg iron, and trying high fiber diet to combat the constipation.

Started iron yesterday and had a small amount of fiber today (whole grain bread), but I just had the most intense stomach pains due to hard stool passing through my large intestine and/or colon. We are talking bouts of pain and pressure that were so bad they made me vomit. Pain stopped once the BMs were out of my system, though there’s some residual tenderness to my abdomen.

I also passed more blood, and what looks to be like some other more fleshy material. I’m guessing maybe parts of my digestive tract that were super inflamed and not happy about hard stool?

Does this sound like UC based on your experiences? I really want some answers after suffering for such a long time.

I've had UC symptoms for about 3 years, starting while I was still in college. Back then, though, I just went to the student health clinic and was diagnosed with IBS. My GP back home at the time told me it was fissures. No one ever thought I should have a colonoscopy and I never thought my symptoms were bad enough. I always got better and would go months at a time with minimal issues. That is, until about 3 or 4 months ago. At my worst, I had 10 BM a day, each one so painful that I cried a few times. I couldn't sleep because the urgency would wake me up every few hours. Sometimes, when I looked into the toilet after I was done, I'd see more blood than actual stool. I had somewhat recently moved to a new city and the first time I had gone to a doctor here was to see what I could do about my situation. He told me to get a colonoscopy, but I didn't get it done until almost a month after because I wanted to make it as cheap as possible. By the time I got the colonoscopy, I was doing somewhat better, but I was definitely still in a flare. Then I got my diagnosis. It felt really therapeutic to have a solid diagnosis, but that quickly wore off when I got my prescription (I haven't met my insurance's high deductible yet, so had to pay for it out of pocket) for mesalamine. And then I started reading up on UC. And then my doctor started giving me advise and telling me what I could expect with this disease. I wanted to be diagnosed with something curable. I didn't want to be diagnosed with something that would never go away. Now I'm just angry. I'm angry about how much pain I'm in, I'm angry about how much money I have to spend to take care of this, I'm angry at all the advice I didn't ask for (""have you tried a bioenergy approach?"" - asked to me by my aunt).

I am trying to work out meds with my doctor but at the moment I’m flaring whenever I get life stress which can be as often as every few weeks or so. 

When that happens, I feel too awful to exercise so I am constantly losing all my progress and fitness, then, when my flare is over, I have to start up again from scratch. It feels so demoralising its making me want to give up exercise altogether. I used to exercise all the time before getting sick and its taking a toll on my self esteem and body image not being able to keep fit. 

I’m wondering how safe it is to keep exercising through a flare. In the past, exercising when not fully recovered from a virus or bacterial infection would sometimes cause it to come back and leave me stuck in bed unable to work for longer, so I have always been quite scared of exercising when unwell. In a flare I normally am basically bedridden apart from essential responsibilities. I’m just wondering how safe/dangerous it is to exercise during flares and if anyone does so/experiences. Thanks!

I have had pneumonia, leg infection, abscess on my tonsil, colds and flu. On each occasion I get mouth ulcers, then a fever and may or may not end up at the emergency ward.

The only thing which helps each time is antibiotics. I seem prone to bacterial infections.

My UC is a new diagnosis. My GI seems happy after 5 months a recent camera up the bum shows massive improvement in the ulceration.

Calling my doctor soon. 

Last night’s post: I went to the doctor about a week ago after having what seemed like normal diarrhea for a couple days just to be safe. That day I ended up having a colitis bm so was thankful I went to the doctor. 

I asked him if there was such thing as a “small flare” because that’s what it seemed like. 

He up’d my lialda and prescribed me budesonide which I’d never been on. 

It’s been a couple days now of regular BMs to the point that I was still unsure if I was flaring. 

I made the mistake of drinking alcohol. I woke up at 3am and vomited and had a terrible colitis bm. 

It was kind of solid but slimy and black and stinky. I haven’t had a flare in a while and now google has me scared I’m going to die from c diff. 

What’s the difference between a regular flare and c diff? I have had c diff before. I have a 1 year old and the internet says c diff is contagious and I’m lost down a 4am google rabbit hole help


New questions: could this sudden reaction (I woke up feeling sick -vomited and pooped) be from mixing alcohol with budesonide? And drinking alcohol while actually having a flare (this whole time I was almost sure it wasn’t actually a flare - I haven’t even pooped for two days before his) I have never vomited from a flare except the first time I ever had one and no one knew it was UC and it went untreated for a few weeks 

I’m less scared about c diff because I thought about what it was like the first time I had it and this doesn’t seem similar. I was just getting panicked by google.

I asked him if there was such thing as a “small flare” because that’s what it seemed like. 

He up’d my lialda and prescribed me budesonide which I’d never been on. 

It’s been a couple days now of regular BMs to the point that I was still unsure if I was flaring. 

I made the mistake of drinking alcohol. I woke up at 3am and vomited and had a terrible colitis bm.

Ive also been dnosed with AS since the UC dnosis. My thought is and even my GI says that its very probable that the suboxone is the reason im not having the frequent stools or flareups due to the constipating or slowing down effects it produces.

The results I’m seeing are that I’m going less often (2x vs 6x), but still have the frequent urge. When I do go, not very much comes out. Still experiencing mucus & occasional cramping/pains. 

The biggest issue I’m still having besides the above is lethargy, and malaise. I have been feeling more & more unwell for days/long periods. The feeling is similar to the flu- all over body aches & much desire for rest despite getting adequate sleep (8+ hours). I’m finding forcing myself to walk a little helps relieve me, but I will still feel the ache come and go for the rest of the day. 

With my new medication, Mercaptopurine, I’m experiencing frequent nausea. 

So here’s my concern & question-
These drugs that I’m being prescribed were created as chemotherapy. I’m really worried about the damage I’m doing long term to my body by taking these kinds of drugs. I understand the biologics are similar in that it’s pretty hard core by suppressing the immune system. My doctor said that would be the next step if the Mercaptopurine stops working. Has anyone gone the more natural route? I’m not interested in stopping my meds anytime soon, or even all of them. But a lot of my friends with autoimmune diseases have gone the natural route and I’m starting to worry that I’m just giving in to the western medicine approach when I do believe a lot of things can be helped with eastern medicine (but within reason).

Anyone have any advice about western vs eastern/ diet approach?",2019-06-24 02:24:05

I’m having a colonoscopy on Friday and today is the first day of my bowel prep. I’m supposed to take milk of magnesia twice a day today and tomorrow, and then Thursday is when I’m on my liquid diet and when I have to take a lot more laxatives.
So the problem is that I’m taking a one month long class at my university and I’m in the 3rd week of it. Even before my bowel prep started I’ve been having bowel control problems, but I’ve been able to make it to the bathroom in time at school, but I have had multiple accidents in the last week at my home and other places. So I’m really trying to stay in this class, but today during lecture I ran to the bathroom and soiled my pants and had to go home (I had a friend bring me my stuff from the classroom, no one knew what happened). I emailed my professor and i only get this one absence from today, and then another absence Thursday with my doctor’s note (my class is M-Th, so I don’t have to miss school on the day of my actual colonoscopy). I’m just so concerned that I’m not going to be so lucky next time and shit my pants with people around. I feel so sick and I can barely eat, but I’ve been willing to push through that to get this credit. But I’m just not willing to embarrass myself, I don’t know what to do. I’m not supposed to take Imodium or eat high fiber foods which would theoretically both bulk up my stool and possibly lead to less diarrhea. Do I need to drop this class? Just skip whenever I feel I need to and take whatever grade penalties I receive? Is there some other remedy I can use to combat incontinence?
Edit: I don’t know why the prep is 3 days long. That’s just what the instructions my doctor gave me said. And I kind of understand why I would get grade penalties for non-attendance. It’s a lab class, so if I’m not there doing the labs there’s not much they can do.",2019-06-25 20:11:17

He had blood in his stool, but was only going a couple of times a day. The results were a mixed bag...some formed and some not. Before this, he’d been doing great for several months. 

His treatment (before this latest flare) was delzicol and methotrexate. When the flare hit, he went on prednisone and kicked up the methotrexate a bit. We’re about 3 weeks later now and his blood seems to have gone away and his calprotectin (sp?) is down around 80. 

GI wants to start him on imuran. So, plan would be to ween off prednisone as we start imuran. And then, once the imuran is in his system, ween off methotrexate. 

The question I have is:

Aren’t flares a given?  I’ve heard that people get in remission for a long time and still get flares. Just wondering why we’d change protocol now, since this flare seems to have been handled relatively easily (his first one last August landed him in the hospital).  Worried that imuran might not work as well.

I was diagnosed last October and some of you may have seen my post of what I went through in all that. I am on remicade now and have started showing symptoms again recently—just a slight increase in average BMs per day from 1 to 4. It may even be completely unrelated to the UC but I am paranoid after what I went through. My mom recently suggested that I get a prebiotic supplementary powder to complement the probiotics I have been taking. Has anyone here tried using a prebiotic supplement before?,2019-06-27 20:04:59

Could a plant based diet be the answer to Crohn's disease?

A new case study of a man with Crohn's disease details how his symptoms disappeared after he stopped eating animal based and highly processed foods. He switched to a diet comprising only plant foods after a year of standard treatment that did not resolve the condition.

Crohn's is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with painful symptoms.

The condition affects millions of people around the world.

Studies have shown that diets comprising fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains can help prevent and treat diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, high blood pressure, and other long-term conditions.

The investigators behind the new study propose that, subject to further research, Crohn's disease should perhaps join that list.

A recent paper in the journal Nutrients gives details of the case together with the researchers' findings and conclusions.

""This case study,"" says study co-author Dr. Hana Kahleova, director of clinical research at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington, DC, ""offers hope for hundreds of thousands of people \[experiencing\] the painful symptoms associated with Crohn's disease.""Crohn's disease is one of two main forms of IBD. IBD is a condition of persistent inflammation that results in damage to the digestive, or gastrointestinal, tract. The other form of IBD is ulcerative colitis.Although it most often affects the small intestine, Crohn's can occur in any part of the digestive tract between the mouth and the anus. Ulcerative colitis mainly affects the colon, or large intestine, and the rectum.The symptoms of Crohn's disease tend to include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, weight loss, and fatigue. They can vary from person to person and can come and go.

The study authors note that around half of people with Crohn's disease require surgery within 10 years of receiving a diagnosis. Only a small minority achieve ""prolonged clinical remission.""

Scientists are undecided about the exact causes of IBD. However, they suspect that the conditions arises from a complex interplay of several factors that include genetics, diet, lifestyle, environment, immune system changes, and gut bacteria imbalances.

One 2015 study paper states that IBD is a global disease that is on the rise in every continent. It already affects more than 1 million people in the United States and 2.5 million people in Europe.

The healthcare costs of IBD are substantial. However, these do not reveal the real burden of a disease that can disrupt careers, impair quality of life, and stigmatize people [socially.In](https://socially.In) the study paper, Dr. Kahleova and colleagues cite research in which people with Crohn's disease benefited from following a Crohn's Disease Elimination Diet (CDED). These have shown remission rates ranging from 62% to 71%.

The CDED and a whole food, plant based diet have some features in common, including significant reduction or omission of processed food and dairy products and an increased intake of dietary fiber.

The man in the recent study was 25 years of age when he received a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. This had followed several years of experiencing symptoms such as bloating, bouts of abdominal pain, fatigue, ulcers, and nausea.

The authors note that doctors classed him as ""high risk due to his moderately severe inflammation, severity of symptoms, diagnosis under the age of 30, and his perianal disease.""

After receiving intravenous infusions of infliximab every 8 weeks for 1 year, the symptoms lessened but the man did not ""achieve clinical remission."" Tests revealed ""mildly clinically active disease,"" and he continued to experience bouts of abdominal pain, bloating, and fatigue.

During his second year of using the medication, the man gave up eating animal and processed foods for 40 days for religious reasons. While he was following a plant based diet, ""he experienced a complete resolution of symptoms.""

Before switching to the plant based diet, his eating habits had been typically American, with daily intakes of meat, dairy, processed foods, and refined grains and modest intakes of fruits and vegetables.Because of the effect it had in completely eliminating his symptoms, the man decided to adopt a plant based, whole food diet for good. He vastly reduced his consumption of processed foods and limited his intake of animal products to a maximum of one serving per week.

He did lapse from this regimen occasionally. When this happened, his symptoms — such as nausea, fatigue, bloating, and mouth ulcers — returned, but they disappeared again when he got back on track.

At the same time, he also began to change his lifestyle. He took up yoga, running, and strength training.

After 6 months of sticking to the new diet and lifestyle, a follow-up colonoscopy of the affected part of his digestive tract revealed ""complete mucosal healing with no visible evidence of Crohn's disease.""

The man was then able to come off his medications completely. That was in August 2017, and the authors note that he has reported ""no relapses since.""Speculating on the reasons behind the results in this case, the researchers mention two points; the first is that a plant based diet promotes microbial diversity in the gut.

The second point they make is that a diet high in fiber also promotes the growth of bacteria that ferment fiber. The byproducts of this fermentation include short-chain fatty acids, which, among other things, can strengthen immunity to disease-causing agents and help control essential functions in the gut.

Readers should note that this study only covers a single case. What works for one person may not work for others.

Scientists should now conduct more research that involves larger groups of people with and without Crohn's disease to confirm whether a plant based diet can put Crohn's disease into complete remission",2019-06-28 16:19:31

I've been on Entyvio since February following a very bad 3 month flare-up.  I feel like it's been successful so far, I'm back at work, back to training hard, and feeling pretty good.  I've had 3 infusions so far.  My only concern is that I constantly have intermittant gas accompanied by a stomach ache which goes away after the gas, and I have been a bit sluggish lately.  I'm not sure what is causing the gas bc I eat what I can tolerate, which is higher protein, moderate fiber, veggies that don't cause too much bloating, tons of water with diet pepsi thrown in there.  

Overall I feel pretty good but I can't help feeling that I'm not feeling AS GOOD as last year when I was on Humira, which failed around Thanksgiving of last year, RIP.  I kind of feel like I'm constantly having very, very mild flare symptoms but no diarrhea/blood.  It's almost like the Entyvio hasn't taken the flare away completely but left me at a tolerable level.  My next infusion is in two weeks and I'm not sure how to explain to my doctor how I'm feeling, which again is pretty good, no interruptions in my day (except for the gas bleh) but I feel like I could be in a super-mild flare.

It was a local tourist area I had never been to. All was going well, visiting shops and what not. Then I got the “let’s move” feeling. I started panicking realizing I had no idea where the bathroom was. No signs nothing. The clerk saw my face and asked if she could help, I asked for their bathroom to which another employee said, “you have to go 3 blocks that way and down one. No shop will let you use their restroom” 
   I was flabbergasted in the moment, wishing I had some medical card to whip out and say, “you have to allow me in” at this moment my husband came around the corner and saw my panicked expression and knowing it well, asked how long do we have? I said not 4 blocks worth. He asked again if I could use their bathroom,  no. We went outside he saw a bar and yelled at me to go to it. I went in went to the bathroom it was locked. The bartender yelled at me paying customers only. I didn’t have any money on me, it was with my husband. So I left and started on the 4 block hike, through crowds of tourists taking their time. Praying to make it. I get to this public bathroom, and of course it’s full. But I was able to hold until I finally got to a stale.

2589,Just need a vent and a laugh. The unsolicited medical advice from my “peers” is driving me insane.,makeupyourworld629,20,ftsfpf,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ftsfpf/just_need_a_vent_and_a_laugh_the_unsolicited/,12,"Hey ya’ll. I wish I could explain this phenomenon to my parents or a friend, but unfortunately it seems like you have to have some sort of illness to really grasp the depth’s of situations like these. I’m sure we’ve all encountered our fair share of unsolicited advice around here. So basically, I’m 21 and in college. Was diagnosed with Severe Ulcerative Colitis last year alongside severe esophagitis and multiple ulcers in the stomach. My symptoms include some pretty severe bleeding, both in my stool and in vomit (thanks esophagus)- and in the past year I have lost some weight and definitely appear to be paler and more gaunt than I once was from the chronic dehydration. I don’t digest many vegetables very well and have to drink a lot extra to keep my body in check. 

Some people LOVE to point out that I look thin or sickly, they also love to let me know that I could be prettier if I grew an ass or started “lifting!” I eat a pretty varied diet, mainly just trying to avoid extremely acidic foods because my doctor and I have not found a special diet that calms my symptoms. I am currently on a PPI and temporarily was on steroids for a bit. My UC definitely affects my quality of life in many ways, and I choose to share this info with friends and family that I trust, but I don’t particularly walk around with a colitis awareness shirt on. Lol. 

So the other day I was on a groupme app (it’s used in universities for communication/study groups). The group had 300+ members. My profile pic is of me at a restaurant smiling with a birthday cake and cheering a glass of wine (it was my bday). One of my hobbies is cooking and recipe developing, and some of my pals know that. At 11 pm I was suddenly tagged with a message from a guy saying, “Maybe you should eat that cake in the picture, you skinny b**ch, not trying to be rude.” I have never spoken to him before. A few of my friends defended me and then I kinda got defensive because I was super hurt and said i have an autoimmune condition and it made me lose a lot of weight. 

ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE CAME IN WITH MEDICAL ADVICE. 

This guy tells me “I was on immunosuppressants but quit cold turkey. I take iron pills now, you should try that.” I was like oh thanks I’ll go off my meds great advice :) Next someone began giving me a list of treatments for UC and diets. When I said, “I’m good, I have a doctor,” he told me that “He’s done papers for his immunology class,” so clearly he knows what he’s talking about. He continued with, “are you sure its ulcerative colitis? have you been tested for that maybe its your metabolism or just gluten” and I’m like hey guys do you want to take a camera and shove it up my butt to look at my bloody colon. Enjoy

By the end i didnt know whether to laugh or cry. The group has been reported and taken down. But yeah. People are really know it alls",2020-04-02 21:10:57

Amazon has stopped selling masks. My wife and I have not been able to find them anywhere else either. Plus, we have been avoiding going inside anywhere in public so that narrows our options even more. We have two masks that we can maybe use (saving for emergency or my infusion). Will that be enough?

I had terrible pain a month ago then nothing, until yesterday.   


I'm now back to clutching my tummy when I walk, having to walk slower than usual, wincing in pain. But no diarrhea or bleeding. I have an appointment with my gastroenterologist in a week and I was thinking to ask to reduce the dose of the mesalazine. I guess not.

At this point I had some blood in my stool but it wasnt all blood. 3 days ago he raised my lialda dose to 3 pills a day and started me on 20mg of prednisone as well. The first day of being on 3 a day there wasnt much difference except a migraine. But then 2 days later of being on 3 lialda a day my poos were basically just very bloody. I told my doctor and he said it could be a side effect of the lialda and to drop back down to 2 pills a day. Has anyone else ever experienced this?

I either don’t poop at all or I’ll pass an extremely small/hard stool. In the past I’ve tried fiber supplements, miralax, etc and when I get desperate a fleet enema or exlax, all working with minimal to moderate success. 

Anyhoo, I was probably 2-3 weeks in with no adequate shit, pretty much accepting this was gonna be my new normal. I’m a night shift nurse, and typically I’ll stop at Starbucks or Dunkin before my 7pm shift and get some coffee. However, due to Covid-19, all my local Dunkin‘s and Starbucks are closed or close around 3pm, and so I decided to stop at McDonald’s and get a medium vanilla iced coffee. I’m not even halfway through the beverage when I get the shit rumbles. I don’t get my hopes up anymore when the rumbles and pains come because it usually ends with no BM or a small BM, and so I take my time getting into work and getting situated. I mosey in and get my scrubs and change and finally decide to use the bathroom. I begin my business, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW?!? I ACTUALLY SHIT! Like, an actual adequate “oh yeah that’s a poop” shit. I almost cried, and you best believe I told all my coworkers afterward(us nurses have no boundaries). 

The next day, I get my Mickey D’s coffee once again, thinking nothing of the previous days’ events. A few sips in, commence the rumbles. I think “It’s too good to be true.” 

It was NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!! Adequate shit #2, and two days in a row!!! I can’t tell you the last time that happened. 

So today, I’m on my way to work, and yup, you know I stopped at McDonald’s again. Could I replicate the events of the previous week a third time? 

I SURE COULD!!! 

I don’t know what it is about their iced coffee. Probably isn’t very good/healthy for the long term, and I’ll definitely need to find a better way of regulating so I don’t have to rely on their coffee, but here and now, I’m enjoying my life sans-constipation, and I figured we all could use the laugh during these trying times!

I even tell myself I am too quick to dwell on the negative despite being an otherwise optimistic person... when it comes to me specifically or things I do, like my job, I'm very hard on myself and can easily spin down the anxiety and stress whole of my own making.  

I took a new job last November - a consulting gig that turns out isn't all that great.  Don't get me wrong, it has definite perks - I work from home (even before COVID-19!), my co-workers seem like decent people, I make ok money.  So what is the issue?  I fill in the blanks like the moron I am.  ""What did he mean by that?"" ""Am I not doing well?"" ""Why is so-n-so doing this or acting like that?""  Honestly, what the hell is wrong with me?  The truth is, I'm a project manager and in my last job I freaking killed it.  In this new job, I don't know... it's so less certain.  I was even brought on to help reform and improve their process and when I tried to do that improvement I was met with such resistance I backed off and I feel stuck now.  

All that to say, my UC has come roaring back to life - as in, dinners over, time to pay the bill.  The stress and anxiety I have felt has been palpable and I feel it in everything now - not just my UC.  My skin is bad, my joint are sore, my muscles ache and now all the symptoms leading to a flare are present.  All because I let this job and the stress of it rule over me.

I do a lot of deep breathing lately.  I try to log off as often as possible, exercise, garden...you name it.  But every week I'm back to this drudgery of trying to keep my mind from latching on to the worst possible scenario.  

Am I insane?  Does this happen to others?  This cycle of worry and anxiety, followed by physical pain that then causes more anxiety... it has to end.  

To be clear, I'm not an unhappy person.  I have so much in my life - it's such a rich and fulfilled life I find it difficult to get all the living in!  So why can I not just shrug off the worries of this job?  Why am I only able to focus on the shit I can't control?  I literally ask myself this out loud sometimes while strolling through my greenhouse (yes.... see.... I'm a fucking king... I'm an avid gardener and having a greenhouse is like having your own castle!).  

Maybe I'm being a wanker... I just need to get over myself.  I am safe, have love in my life and right now I have meds headed for me that'll knock this UC back in to place...

So this week I finally muscled you’re after 2 weeks of symptoms to call him. He had a telemedicine appt with me, and told me that we can get back on the enemas for now but they aren’t sustainable.
He spent about half an hour explaining four other options: 

-prednisone and immunomodulator pill 
-Humira 
-Remicade 
-Entivyo

I’m not sure how to decide which. He said they’re all very viable options, but that the infusions or injections would be a better long term choice, and he’s partial to Entivyo because it targets the gut. I did research like he said between them, and now I’m stuck between Humira and Entivyo, I’m not sure which one to do. I’m trying to break the tie by cost.

I think I'm getting another fecal calprotectin test in about a week and hopefully sweet sweet remission!!

So I had 0 refills left on my Lialda and I called my pharmacy and they said it's ready for pick up which wow ok cool, but when I went there they said that they are waiting on authorization from the insurance. 

I called my doctor's office every day and asked them to send the pre-auth to the insurance and even spoke directly to my doctor's assistant who seemed confused despite all the messages that were being sent to her by the other people I spoke to on the phone. I even called the insurance and I offered to explain my symptoms to give a reason for them to let me have my medicine. 

Is it hard to send a pre-authorization? I understand that there are other patients and there's a pandemic happening, but it is ONE email or whatever to send to the insurance. 

People recommended GoodRx but even with that the brand-name that I get is still over a thousand dollars. 

TL;DR doctor's assistant not sending the pre-authorization to insurance and I'm almost out of my Lialda. I have only had 1 other prescription renewal and this has never happened.

This is mostly just me venting. There's not much I can do since it's the weekend but I'm ready to be a bitch come Monday if I still can't get my medication.

UPDATE/EDIT: it turns out the pharmacy was trying to put me on the generic brand.. that's why they needed a pre-authorization. Should also add that I didn't know about this and I'm not sure what effect generic would have on me, so i'm hopefully picking up my regular Lialda tomorrow.",2020-04-05 20:05:38

For the past several years I've had on and off back pain, probably caused by 3 disc herniations and several other issues I have going on (as determined by an MRI).  The fact that I've been training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for the past 8 plus years probably has something to do with it too.  For the most part, in the past, I've dealt with my back flares (not UC flares) with rest, staying in good shape, and lots of Naproxen when I needed it (which may have contributed to the UC).  The longest I've ever had to sit out from Jiu Jitsu due to back issues was a month, now I'm pushing 4 months with no end in sight.  

Now that I know I can't take NSAIDs my back is just bad and not really getting better, this is since my last back related incident which started in November.  

At this point I'm not sure if my lack of back pain related progress is due to my injuries progressing to the point where they just won't get better, or if it's because the Naproxen was helping a great deal and now I can't get the inflammation in my back under control.  I've taken Tylenol a few times but that doesn't seem to do much, plus I'm not crazy about the hit on the liver with Tylenol.

Anyone have any luck in a similar situations?  

I'm currently trying:

Exercise:  Standard PT stuff (core strengthening, weights, stretching), yoga  
Supplements:  Fish oil, turmeric extract, CBD oil, glucosamine & chondroitin

Hi friends! I'm kind of new here. I recently got diagnosed with mild/moderate UC with 95% confidence. After basically a year of suffering from loose, urgent stools, and nausea 4-10 times a week (lots of unpleasant running to the bathroom at 2 am when I'm in bed + running to the bathroom while I'm at the office at 10 am every day), I finally have confirmation that I have UC from my doctors.

About two weeks ago I was prescribed 1.2 g x 4 Mezavant pills per day and 1 Salofalk (mesalamine) enema per day. I got the medicine almost 2 weeks ago, but somehow (with no significant change in diet or exercise), my IBD symptoms have vanished even though I haven't yet started the meds.

And after months and months of feeling shitty, this week I have normal brown, solid, unpainful poop. No toilet explosions, no having to immediately clean the entire toilet bowl after going! Of course that happens right after I spend $400 out of pocket on medicine.. lol. 

**Questions:**

**(1)** If you were me, would you still begin the medication even though I'm feeling fine right now? Or should I ride this out for as long as it lets me and start the Mezavant and Salofalk when I need to?

**(2)** For those of you on Salofalk, do you take it every single night? Or as needed? My doctor told me to ""try it out"" but said ultimately I could decide if I wanted to take both Mezavant + Salofalk or if I wanted to just do Mezavant. I understand the research says its more effective to take both. Between us, I'm uncomfortable about the idea of putting this thing up my butt lol, but of course, do plan on eventually using it \*sigh\* lol.

I consider to increase my Imuran dosage to 75 mg. I am around 50 kilograms and my liver enzymes is fine. I have been using Imuran since last September and my body tolerated well. I know Imuran acts slowly but i need to do something. 

I made a research and found something about WBC count. Which says lower WBC counts mean more remission possibility. My WBC count never fall below 7. So i think if i increase my Imuran dosage at least i can hope something good. I know i am not a doctor but i really have to do something.

2656,Thank you Remicade!,MN_Number_Muncher,8,fx7w4v,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/fx7w4v/thank_you_remicade/,0,"A little back story.  I was originally diagnosed with UC back in 1989 and was put on some meds that kicked it into remission for a long time.  I was off of the meds after about a year.  Around 2000, a doctor told me he wasn't sure if I really had UC since I hadn't had any symptoms in years and so we all just went with it until about 2 years ago.  I started having symptoms again and flared up.  I went in for a colonoscopy and they reconfirmed the UC diagnosis.  My GI doc put me on mesalamine pills and enemas.  They weren't working, so I got a Prednisone burst while they switched me to Remicade. I've been on that since last August and it got me into remission.

Now with this whole COVID-19 stuff going on and adding stress to my plates at work and home, we found out that we have a break in our sewer line.  I'm extremely grateful that my Remicade is working since we have a very slow draining sewer until it's repaired.  We've had 3 different companies try clearing the line to be absolutely certain it's not roots.  That means my wife and I are using any water sparingly if it goes into the sewer.  We've only been able to find 1 company who's willing to repair it due to the depth (around 30 feet deep) since we're at the top of a hill near the end of the downward slope of the line in the street.  Now I sit here waiting for the quote to fix it knowing that it'll be not a small number, and hoping the city will approve it so we can add it as an assessment to our property taxes.  We'll be without sewer access for roughly 3 days when they begin the repair.  So much for social distancing for us for a bit while getting this all fixed.

Thanks for letting me vent everyone!  We're also fortunate that neither of us have lost our jobs and to have my in-laws live about a quarter mile down the street so we can stay with them instead of having to use a port a potty when they're fixing it.",2020-04-08 16:56:24

I have been on both Amgevita and Azathioprine for around 10 months now as a combination treatment for ulcerative colitis and proctitis. Safe to stay IBD wise I am in a good place now luckily after a rough two years. I can pretty much eat and drink anything now with normal is function which is amazing (still the odd very bad few days though). 

The problem is though, these tablets are making me pretty weak (M29) previously I was pretty athletic with a slim build but now I just find I ache constantly with very little energy. 

A simple task like washing my car is enough to leave me exhausted. If I over-do it, like this week garden landscaping, the next day my whole body literally aches and I have very little energy. It takes me a full day or two to recover before I start getting feeling back. General things I have noticed just take more effort! 

I am not sure which medication is causing it, but it's having a pretty big impact. I am 29 going on 70 at this rate! Has anyone else noticed this?",2020-04-08 10:17:52

Sadly my UC is no longer under any treatment due to my insurance no longer covering the drug and moving to different states aka losing my doctor. Keeping my fingers crossed!!!)

However, while I no longer have any pain or frequent bowel movements, I barely ever HAVE bowel movements. The frequency ranges from once a week to once every two weeks. I have tried taking laxatives, they don't ever work, and I have to eat tons of fiber to even HOPE to use the restroom (while still staying away from problematic foods that used to bother me in the past.) 

My question is if this is a normal thing to experience? Can you suffer from some sort of intestinal paralysis from years of uncontrollable UC? Or could this be a flair that I am unaware of? (All my flairs in the past have been my iimmune system going crazy against me with bloody stools and mucus and throwing up, etc. So I don't think it would be a flair )

2665,24 year old Male - not tried any medication. . .not sure why,yusi1234,5,fww4ix,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/fww4ix/24_year_old_male_not_tried_any_medication_not/,12,"Hello all,

I am a 24 year old male living in the UK and was diagnosed with UC 4 years ago. I would say my condition is moderate, and my symptoms are described below. Before I start I would just like to thank everyone on this community. This horrible condition can get you feeling down at the best of times, and it is always reassuring to visit this community and know you are not alone.

My first question is around some of the symptoms I have. I have 4-5 bloody bowel movements throughout the course of the day and often these bowel movements will produce nothing but a bloody mucus and gas. I often have a slight stomach cramp/feeling throughout the day, almost as though i can feel the blood/mocus/gas in my lower abdoment. This is often accompanied by a sense of nausea. Does anyone else also suffer with this weird sensation/symptom?

I have been to my doctor multiple times throughout my time with they condition and they have often prescribed me with medication to take, (Asocol I believe). However, I am yet to start taking any medication. I am not sure why exactly this is. I often in my mind come up with lots of crazy reasons not to start taking the medication;

• Currently the cause of all IBD illness are not known and none of the medications cure IBD so there is no point in taking the medication
• I am slightly scared about the side effects of these medications (Do not want to swell up like a balloon as everyone at work will know something is wrong with me)
• I tell myself these symptoms are manageable and okay to live with, but then get down about them very often, so they are clearly affecting me more than I care to admit
• I have resigned to the fact that this condition will control my life, so perhaps that plays a part as to why I do not want to start the medication.
• I tell my self I will cure myself through diet and have tried things like the Carnivore diet and Juicing diets both of which provided decent results but I have always ended up back eating a fairly bad diet and just living with the flare up symptoms (I have low will power in general)

Just writing these out I see how silly it is that I have not started or even tried medication, and I feel stupid for it. Yet I am still not 100% about starting. Has anyone else had this issue, whereby for an unexplainable reason I am not taking any medication and just living in what seems to be a constant flare?

Thanks for taking the time to read and any advice in my situation would be greatly appreciated, as this conditon has been getting me really down lately 

Look forward to your responses :)",2020-04-08 02:24:30

The one time I went to a gastro doctor, he did a fecal occult and it was positive. He wanted to do an endoscopy but I chickened out. I’m super afraid of anesthesia so have been avoiding. But I am making another appointment. 

The stomach pain itself comes and goes but it’s mostly on my left side. Everything feels crampy, hard, burning, and just very inflamed. It does extend all the way around where my colon would be. It makes it hard to breath. 

Symptoms and results:

Goiter (normal thyroid results)

Low potassium without cause

Low sodium without cause 

Low normal ferritin 

Heart arrithymia that occurs with gut pain flares

High blood pressure that occurs with gut pain flares

Constipation, occasional diarrhea

Sometimes acid that I can feel in my esophagus 

Nausea and sometimes dry heaving 

Loss of appetite, even loss of thirst bc it can make me bloated too 

Urgency to make a bowel movement with severe pain sometimes

Sometimes not fully emptying, sometimes huge bowel movements

Lots of mucus with bowel movements 

Blood when I wipe sometimes

Severe fatigue 

Muscle weakness and pain

Sometimes joint pain

Headaches 

Severe bloating and belching

Shortness of breath 

Waking up gasping for breath and air and tachardyia- this ONLY happens when I’m in a “flare” with my stomach

Peripheral neuropathy and cold extremities 

Have definitely noticed that caffeine, coffee, sugar, dairy, gluten, corn, potatoes, nightshades, lots of raw items, heavy meals, spicy foods, alcohol (hellll no), extra fiber like psyllium, lemon water, vinegar, chocolate, and beans can all make me feel worse. Also seeds and nuts. Literally like everything these days. 

Bentonite clay and activated charcoal sometimes help me feel better. 

I know it’s not cool to go on subs and look for a diagnosis- I’m not- but I am just so freaking tired from having all these symptoms and having no answers. At this point, I can barely work or take care of my child. It’s affecting everything. Just curious if these symptoms sound like UC?

My GI says a big NO to dairy, but says if I’ve got the appetite for it to try a BRAT diet. So far toast has been ok. Applesauce is ok but so so sad - I mean it’s applesauce. Either way, I’m stuck in the cycle of “OMFG I’m starving!!” followed closely by “I’m sorry colon!! I’ll never eat again!” - which I think we all know too well. Well, I just watched TBBT, and Penny made French Toast. Now I want French Toast. If I did ok with the regular toast, do u think the addition of the cooked eggs would be too much? Shoot come to think of it, the egg would be the biggest single protein source I’ll have had all month. Will I overwhelm my tummy? Has anyone had any experience with French Toast that has left you in some sort of Vendetta against breakfast foods?

Sorry guys - I’m just soooo hungry but scared to eat anything other than my broth",2020-04-12 22:50:16

Told me my liver was fucked up because I'm slightly overweight. Apparently people with UC have a larger chance to have liver complications. 

Told me to go off mesalamine and to not start entyvio. Me and my doctor scoffed. 

I was telling him sometimes I go a couple days between BM but when I return, I have the grossest bristol scale 6/7 diarrhea. He says ""wow, you don't go to the bathroom for 5 days regularly?

My inflammation has been getting way better on mesalamine enemas and prednisone with Balsalazide lately, as I had a flare starting a month ago, but upon this flare, I had to call my doctor. She then told me after all this covid stuff is over, we should start Remicade and lately I’ve been getting really nervous about it... I know it’s necessary if she’s suggesting we do it, and I know it’s better than being on and off prednisone, but I’m just so nervous because it just seems like such a huge ordeal. However, I’ve heard many people say they’ve reached years of remission on remicade or other biologics. Do any biologic users have any words of encouragement or solace for me at this time?

I searched the sub for an update on this, and didn't find it. I just discovered this info today, so thought I'd share.

Like many of us, I've been watching the [IBD COVID link](https://covidibd.org/current-data/) that documents worldwide IBD patients who've been diagnosed with COVID-19, and includes the treatments they take and patient outcomes. I'd noticed in recent days that the number of patients taking Xeljanz remained very low compared to patients taking other meds. This got me wondering...if something like Hydroxychloroquine, a drug which RA patients use, has the potential to treat COVID-19 patients, and RA patients *also* take Xeljanz, could there be a chance Xeljanz may also help COVID-19 patients? Shot in the dark, but I wondered...

Being obsessed with research and fascinated with medicine, I did some searching and found something interesting. [Pfizer is working to develop a treatment and/or vaccine](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_advances_battle_against_covid_19_on_multiple_fronts), and as part of their developments, they're starting a [clinical trial in Italy to see how Xeljanz (tofacitinib) may help fight COVID-19 pneumonia symptoms](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04332042?term=tofacitinib&cntry=IT&draw=2&rank=1). They theorize that JAK inhibitors may block inflammatory markers that exasperate COVID-19 symptoms, and could potentially help stabilize patients.

This doesn't mean those of us who take it are protected, especially since they have no data yet. But it's a very interesting development, and we should watch it.",2020-04-16 00:15:54

(I'm new here, so please forgive me if I'm doing this wrong or if this isn't the right place for this content.) I am a journalist (who also suffers from chronic abdominal problems) and I am currently considering writing a book about living with stomach issues, based on my own experiences as well as those of many others. It's something many people deal with, but I think we are embarrassed/unsure how to talk about it. In terms of content, think less clinical: ""Why My Stomach Hurts: According to Medical Experts,"" and more personal: ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Stomachaches.""

My initial vision for the project is to eventually write a collection of nonfiction essays exploring themes such as: the connection between stress/emotion/mental illness and the stomach, people's complicated love-hate relationships with food, the daily routines of managing chronic pain/digestive problems, the impact these symptoms have on one's career and personal relationships, and experiences with doctors/treatments/diagnoses, etc. This idea is still very new to me, but I'd love to hear people's thoughts and stories if you're comfortable sharing or potentially being interviewed.

I'm happy to hear from anyone dealing with chronic abdominal pain, or even their witnessing friends & family, whether that's related to IBS/IBD, Ulcers, Colitis, Crohn's Disease, PCOS, Celiac Disease, Eating Disorders, Endometriosis, Food Allergies, etc. Please feel free to share with anyone who might be interested.

Please Note: I am not a doctor or medical professional. I cannot diagnose or offer medical advice. I have degrees in writing, so I guess that means I can offer emotional support and poems, if that helps.

Thank You!

Just wondering, are there... better ways to go about squeezing the damn air out? Or am I just an idiot for not covering the tip before squeezing? Idk, I guess above all I just needed to vent lol. It's so infuriating when I get a bottle with huge air bubbles in it ://",2020-04-16 08:58:12

Ive dropped about 20 pounds in the past few weeks and my energy levels are terrible,  and im willing to bet a lot of it comes from the drastic reduction in calories.  


My question is,  what are your go tos for calorie intake while youre flaring?   Ive been trying to do mostly gluten/dairy free and stick mostly with low fiber fruits and veges,  but any input would be great.    I dont need to get up to 2000 calories a day,  but would like to try to get around 1500 at least  


Some of the things currently on my list are avocados,  organic no sugar added peanut butter,  papaya, miso soups,  homemade sauerkraut (for the  probiotics, but it has almost zero calories).  


Any other suggestions on things I could add to improve my caloric intake to try and help with my energy levels?

I just wanted to post a positive post of my ""success story"".

&#x200B;

Just about 2 years ago I had a terrible flare up that worsened my condition from a mild UC to a rather serious case that led to 3 hospitalizations in 3 months and addition of Azathioprine and Remicade to my treatment. I was running to the bathroom 10+ times a day, I lost 25 pounds (155 to 130) in a matter of a 3 weeks. 

&#x200B;

Recently, 20 months after the flare up, my doctor told me I""m in remission. I did not think this day was going to come after reading up on how people struggle for years without any real solution.

I just wanted to post here and let those who don't currently have their condition under control that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and to keep a positive attitude especially during these hard times.

Does this make sense to anyone? My doctor called me to say he won't be able to refill my Azathioprone prescription (been on for 2.5 years no side effects, only thing that has ever kept me in remission).

His reasoning was that because I'm isolating for 12 weeks and can't go for a blood test it's too risky to keep taking it. BUT obviously the only reason I was instructed to isolate is because I'm on the medication in the first place.

I felt there was an ulterior motive personally, and have read a handful of stories about there being a shortage of this drug in the UK right now.

Diagnosed 7 years ago with mild UC which ended up turning into a severe flare over the past few months. Unfortunately I’ve been unresponsive to oral and IV steroids. My GI and I decided that the best course of action would be to use a biologic to help induce remission (and for long term maintenance), we decided to try Entyvio.

Question for those that used Entyvio to help induce remission, how did that process look like for you? Was it a very gradual improvement or did you just wake up one day with a big difference? When did the bleeding stop and when did your urgency / bm count become more manageable?

My final loading dose was last week and my GI said to expect most of the improvements (assuming it works for me) between now and the first maintenance dose.

I know everyone has different experiences with the surgery and I don't like to influence anyone unless they do their research and talk to their doctor but I strongly advocate for the surgery. Especially if you are always in a constant flare and medications keep on failing you.

Here is my story...

&#x200B;

March of 2014 I started getting more and more liquid BM's. Then the urgency started kicking in. I was a runner and would be out on a 5+ mile run and it would hit me out of no where and I would be running into bushes to go. Over the next few months I wouldn't have any time at all to make it to the bathroom. I would be at work and bam, out of no where I would shit my pants and have to leave work. Sitting down I would be fine but as soon as I stood up I just had no chance. I never thought at 26 years old, being a full grown man that I would be shitting my pants on a daily basis. Soon I started wearing diapers.

I went to see my primary care doc and he was useless. At first he diagnosed me with salmonella poisoning.... Then after a month of it still going on he told me that I had an acute case of C diff. I knew he was more full of shit than I was at the time and I went to a different doctor. After seeing a different doc the first thing he did after telling him what has been going on was send me to see a GI specialist. One meeting with them I was scheduled to get a colonoscopy.

Now 6 months after my first symptoms I was diagnosed with a severe case of UC. My whole colon and rectum were totally infected. At this time I was going to the bathroom 20-30 times a day and if I wasn't within 20 feet of a bathroom I wouldn't make it.  My quality of life went way down hill. I was going to school full time and working full time. I had to quit school because I couldn't be in class with out having to get up multiple times to go to the bathroom and it wasn't fun shitting my pants near my fellow students. Not only that but I lost close to 30 pounds after only weighing 137 pounds most my life as it was. I had to take a leave of absence from my job and after living on short term disability for 6 months and still not feeling better I had to quit. Luckily I was able to collect unemployment and made more on that but I knew that wouldnt last long as I had to still be looking for work. 

I was on high doses of prednisone, 60 mg a day for almost a year and that was the only thing that worked. I tried medication after medication and they all failed. My face got fat, my joints ached and my whole system felt out of wack. A year of being out of work I started feeling better being on the predisone and maybe having 10 bowel movements a day and being able to make it to the bathroom. So that's when I decided it was time to go back to work. My doc started to wean me off the predisone but I started to go right back to where I was, so I went back on.

After almost another year of being on predisone I decided enough was enough. I asked my doc about any other options and he mentioned the surgery but he suggested I keep trying different meds. I had enough of shitting my pants for over two years now tho so I decided to talk to a surgeon. The surgeon couldn't believe my GI doc hadn't had me talk to a surgeon sooner.

I was worried tho. I knew my GI doc just wanted me to keep taking meds and was against the surgery because not only was me taking meds padding his pocket but having surgery would mean Id be seeing him less. The medical bills were also staking up. I also knew tho that a surgeon wants to do what a surgeon does.. and that's surgery.

In the end I chose the surgery and it was the best decision I have ever made. It was a rough year or so after but that was a lot on me learning how to deal with a pouch. I can eat almost anything I want. I have maybe 5- 6 bowel movements a day and I have yet to full blown shit my pants since.  That alone is worth it for me. The only long term negative is the occasional leakage at night but I will take that over shitting my pants any day. I take some immodium and wear a small pad and I am fine.

Now it has been 6 years since my first symptom and I feel like a normal human being again. I strongly advocate for the surgery and if anyone who read all this has any questions about the process or what it entails please feel free to comment or message me. I wish I didn't wait as long as I did to get it done. I guess there is always hope that the right med will work or the flares will stop but that never happened for me.",2020-04-20 05:40:06

I just wanted to get it out because I'm really emotional right now and I feel like maybe some people might be able to relate.

I think one of the worst parts of this illness is chronic. I'll never fully get better. This won't ever end. Yes, medication can and does help. But there isn't a cure. I will always have ulcerative colitis. And I'm allowed to grieve about it.

Yes, we should learn to accept and embrace this illness as a part of ourselves. Right now, though, I'm laying in my bed crying. It's so hard to know that I will sacrifice my health, my happiness, even my sanity, to this stupid chronic illness. That this is forever and won't go away on it's own, or even through medical intervention. 

I'm only 21, and I've spent the majority of my life with ulcerative colitis, both undiagnosed and diagnosed. It kills me a little inside knowing that I'll spend even more time with it. I don't want to grieve what I've lost or won't have.

But I have to.

At first I thought it was fine once I got prescribed anti depressants. My mood was actually pretty stable for once and I was healing; feeling pretty good! But I started tapering down to 35mg three days ago and I feel like my mental health has been deteriorating. Like, not just crying and being anxious about stuff; I just feel straight out of hell crazy. Some little conscious in my head keeps telling me my roommates are annoyed with me, I can’t tell what’s real sometimes, and I keep thinking my boyfriend doesn’t love me anymore, even though we’ve been texting and keeping up with each other every day. I also feel like I’m a different person for every situation I face. I’m just scared. It could also have to do with the fact I stopped taking a birth control for a week, as to let shark weed be shark week. Maybe it’s that... also my body is changing immensely, and I’m transmasculine so it hurts a bit more than the average patient I suppose. Has anyone else had stuff like this? It feels like a nightmare, but I can’t just stop the meds without facing serious consequences. any tips?

- no insurance. Most likely cannot afford Remicade here. 

- history of on and off prednisone. I recently just found out I have osteoporosis that need to be treated for at a local clinic in korea.

- hard to travel back home because of the virus outbreak, Especially during a flare

I've been having mild flare symptoms since December and have been on oral prednisolone plus pred foam since then. My doctor wants me to start a new biologic as I can't stay on pred long-term.

I've been on a few biologics in the past. Humira worked wonders for me after a very severe flare up and hospitalisation, but I had bad allergic reactions to it. So I can't use that anymore.

Entyvio did nothing. Remicade worked for a little while. I'm allergic to NSAIDS and salicylates so ASAs aren't an option either. Imuran caused dangerously low white cell counts.

The next medication to try is Simponi, but I'm wondering if it's too hard-hitting for a very mild flare, especially with Covid19. i.e. If I can avoid suppressing my immune system during a pandemic that would be great.

My symptoms at the moment are just bleeding (which is slowly reducing) and urgency after exercise. My energy levels and appetite are fine and I have little to no pain.

Any thoughts or suggestions on what else I could try before Simponi? Thanks!",2020-04-21 17:40:43

The doctors said that the symptoms I had didn't have any explanation that they were aware of and that they had to assume it was coronavirus (I live in Barcelona which is very severely affected) as they had heard that about 10% of patients have GI symptoms although the details were still unknown. They didn't do a test on me though, because I was still breathing with no problem.  

  

After two weeks of vomiting, I started having diarrhoea (and I had also had some the week before the vomiting). Previously I had been controlling it by cutting out fibre entirely. I had been put on mesalamine but it just made it worse, so I'm currently waiting for my next appointment with the GIist. However cutting out fibre had been highly effective, stopping all GI bleeding and also preventing diarrhoea, even making me mildly constipated (which I don't actually mind in comparison to the severe diarrhoea). While I was vomiting my doctor recommended that I stop eating dairy and bread. Bread has always been something I can only eat in small quantities, but dairy had always helped me not have diarrhoea (somehow), but as I was unable to even sip water without vomiting I did as she said, and combined with an antiemetic injection it seemed to help.  

  

The diarrhoea has been persisting though. I've now reintroduced dairy which has helped to an extent, but not the same as it used to. I still have very loose stools every day with, for the first time, both red and black blood simultaneously, as well as bits of undigested food which I used to get when I ate vegetables. I imagine this means that whatever I had has wrecked both my stomach and bowels. What the hell do I do at this point? I'm already on an insanely restrictive diet and I can't identify any other triggers, I'm essentially eating chicken and rice and Spanish omelettes (without onion) most of the time, which has always been very good for me.  

  

I should also point out that my colonoscopy revealed chronic inflammation (and pointed towards IBD) but the biopsy didn't come out as positive for either UC or Crohn's, but as my symptoms are almost all UC symptoms, my GIist said we will treat it as if it's UC unless nothing works in the end at which point she'll assume it's Crohn's and try again. The inflammation in my bowel is only a continuous area in the lower section.",2020-04-21 12:03:22

I had my colon removed after a year of rapidly progressing UC and now have a J pouch which is doing just fine despite a few bouts of pouchitis. The other day I called to see about appointments at a new hospital with IBD experts because I want to get the best care possible to avoid recurring pouchitis or any other issues. They tell me they’ve cancelled in person visits for cases that “aren’t that serious.” I responded with a bunch of medical terms and an angry tone because I felt the receptionist (and eventually the nurse) didn’t understand the varying degrees of severity for colitis. It is an autoimmune disease after all. I’m not calling for IBS (not to rag on IBS people). 

So, after telling this poor lady in excruciating detail how they cut my colon out and I need to make sure my systems are getting proper care (because my local GI isn’t cutting it) they finally call me back up and get something on the books for relatively soon. 

Is there a better way to get taken seriously? We all know the issues that come with other people because this is an invisible disease and hard to talk about. Sometimes I feel it’s my fault because I don’t like pity or sympathy or talking about it where others can see such as on social media. It’s doesn’t help that I’m young and look healthy. And it also doesn’t help that nobody knows about this disease or the J pouch, which is why I sometimes just tell people I have Crohn’s since it has a name and will stop further questions. I know from dealing with my own friends and family that they assumed it was something minor until they saw me in a hospital gown. 

This sub has such a great attitude about it all and that’s how usually I am too. You’ve got to laugh at it to stay mentally strong and I don’t want to give up that approach but I’m struggling to find another way to be taken seriously without resorting to anger and/or excruciating detail",2020-04-21 04:42:20

However, after reaching out, my symptoms evened out (which I thought made sense because a highly stressful period caused by my liver disease had subsided, so I figured maybe stress was messing with my system). I ended up doing the tests yesterday since I had to go to the lab anyway for other blood work.

The tests came back positive for cdiff, and she wants me to do the vancomycin regimen. I don’t really have any c diff symptoms- no abdominal pain, fever, and I only go to bathroom 1-2x/day that is somewhat loose with a bit of urgency. That’s not too far from normal for me, though. 

My doctor said I could have c diff colonization, but not infection, which is why I am asymptomatic. There is no test that can discern between the two. To my understanding, in the general population, colonization would not be reason to start antibiotics. Is it different in the UC population? Can the antibiotics get rid of colonization? If I have colonization, is it likely to become infection?  I know very little about c diff and most of what I am reading online is in reference to infection not colonization.

I’m surrounded by supportive people but no one can relate like I’m sure this group can. 

Usually get a flair up around this time every year. And up until last year, a quick cycle of prednisone always did the trick. Last year not so much and once I realized the prednisone wasn’t working, my dr put me on budesinide which worked like a charm. So this year, naturally I went right for the budesinide once I started feeling urges. Didn’t help at all. Was very hesitant to jump back into the prednisone with everything going on but decided I needed to do what I could to get better. I hunkered down in my house to not be exposed to anything for the last 3 weeks of prednisone, only to have absolutely no effect on my flair up. I asked my doc to get the ball rolling on Humira as my next option, that was 10 days ago...

Things started taking a turn for the worst this week. Monday morning, something changed from the regular urges of mucous and blood to these really painful episodes all day and night coupled with an extreme amount of swelling and inflammation in my ass. Doctor prescribed me a suppository to help with the inflammation which helped for a day or so but now it just gets expelled before it can provide any relief. 

This is where my patience is running thin. This Humira should have been ready for me a week ago. There’s been a daily back and forth with insurance company, pharmacy and doctors office. Everyone says they are missing something. No one seems to be able to get in touch with the other party and for some reason I’m stuck being the middle man to negotiate what’s needed from each party, when I can even get a callback.

I have every side effect imaginable. Gained tons of weight, sweaty all of the time, I’m

I feel shallow for even complaining about this—I am SO grateful to have these meds, but it’s so hard to not *feel* like myself every day, and now I look in the mirror and I don’t even recognize myself. 

The silver lining is being stuck at home right now so I’m kinda in hiding, but when I video call with people they definitely notice how different I look.

Didn’t really take it seriously at first but as time went on it got worse, and I don’t have any family history of this happening (that I know of, of course). Ended up getting referred to a GI to have a sigmoidoscopy (literally so uncomfortable) where I was told it looked like proctitis (20 cm) and was put in meslamine suppositories. 

However, my results came back “non-specific” and the suppositories didn’t work. Contacted my doctor &amp; was put on prednisone and meslamine pills (5 days ago). So far I’ve been able to have bowel movements, but now it’s like I’ll be completely fine one moment and the next I’m sprinting to the bathroom.

I feel like it’s hard to be able to talk to people about this. I’m lucky to be blessed with such an understanding S/O who has been helping me but I’ve been tending to freak out and resorting to google everything.

I started on Azathioprine a couple of months back and was made aware that I should be careful about too much exposure to the sun as the drug causes photosensitivity. 

I’m from Wales, UK - we don’t get a lot of sun but the last few days we’ve had some so I thought I’d make the most of it yesterday and sit in the garden for a bit. I was careful about how long I was in the sun for so I only sat out there for about an hour max but already I’m noticing sun burns and rashes on my arms. 

I have a few questions: 

1. Do I literally just use sun cream to help? Are there really high factor ones I can use? 
2. Are there specific sun creams I can use for this type of issue?
3. Even if I do use sun cream will I still have to really limit my self and stay in the shade most of the time? 

I am (depending on the current world situation) travelling to California in September which I was thoroughly looking forward to, but this has put a dampener on it as I feel like I’ll constantly be concerned about being in the sun and staying in the shade and I won’t be able to enjoy the holiday. 😞

Anyway, those are probably stupid questions 😅 I assume you just use sun cream but wanted to ask just to make sure and to see if anyone has any experience with this. Any advice would be appreciated! :)

A few months ago I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis.  I have had literally no symptoms the whole time (it started late last year) except blood in my stool.  So anyways, I was on Mesalamine which seemed to work ok, but the bleeding never stopped entirely.  Eventually, my Doctor put me on Budesonide, saying it would knock this out fast, which it did.  No bleeding at all for nearly three weeks.  

However, I did something very stupid.  I had been very careful with my diet after the diagnosis, but as I was in complete remission, and as I was dealing with immense stress given the whole Covid 19 situation, I decided to let the diet go for a few days and just hog out.  Pizza, BBQ chicken wings, Baby Back Ribs, it's like it was the 4th of July and I was Jabba the Hut.

Now, I think I'm paying the price for this decision, dearly.  It all started last night.  Horrible cramping and pain in and around my Colon and maybe my stomach too (not sure if my stomach actually was hurting, or if the rectal pain was so bad that it was just kinda radiating everywhere).  I kinda alternated between diarrhea and constipation as well, with a frequent urge to go number 2.  I also had some nausea, but I think It was just due to the pain being so bad.  It kept me up basically all night and has persisted the rest of the day.  Being that this is naturally the weekend, I can't get in contact with my Doctor until Monday.  

In the meantime, I am suffering horribly.  Do these symptoms match what could be considered a ""flare""?  Or could it be something else?  I realize some of you may suggest going to the hospital, but I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty terrified of that right now due to Covid 19.  I called my local ER, and they basically said it's a mess.  Loads of Covid patients and no separation of those who are sick and those who aren't.  It just doesn't seem safe, especially when the Budesonide can affect my immune apparently (?), and I love with my elderly parents who I also risk infecting should I get the virus.

So anyways, is this likely a flare?  Should I just try to wait it out instead of risking an ER visit?  Is there anything I could try to alleviate my symptoms?",2020-04-26 01:02:26

2861,UPDATE on my last post - 21m diagnosed March 6 with doctors wanting to operate 40 days later,Fubby2,46,g9wcpv,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/g9wcpv/update_on_my_last_post_21m_diagnosed_march_6_with/,26,"My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/g3ogg1/diagnosed_march_6_40_days_later_and_the_doctors/) got a lot of attention on the form so i figured id follow up with how it went down.

I cancelled the surgery last minute. I was seeing consistent and better improvement than I ever had before on past doses of remicade. The third dose seemed to be working. We had to confirm that this was not mostly caused by the high iv steroids which I was on, so I went off IV steroids and started back on oral pred. Amazingly, my symptoms continued to improve. By Wednesday I was down to a CRP of 7, (over 100 on admission), hemaglobin of 86 (low of 69), and the doctor said if my condition didnt get worse by thursday I could leave surgery free. He said that I had about a 50/50 chance of getting out without surgery this year, which is WAY better than just two days ago when they were telling me treatment had failed.

Thurday came around and I was actually optimistic for the first time in a long time. I get my blood test back AND! It comes back CRP 11. My white blood cell count is a little up. The doctor wants to keep me one more day. My symptoms start to get worse. I have small amounts of blood again for the first time after starting remicade. Friday comes around and its worse. My CRP is 18, bowel movements up to about 9 with more blood than before. It is now clear to me and the doctor that medical treatment has failed. I know in theory there are many other drugs, but at my level of severity I would need a constant stream of blood to not die or to live on IV steroids, both impossible.

I started fasting that day and they operated Saturday. So far im just in the hospital getting used to my ileostomy. The surgery went well, the recovery is on good pace, and I'm slated to leave tomorrow if things are fine. Honestly it really sucks that I had to have surgery. A lot of people come out feeling a renewed sense of life and stuff, but most people were sick for a long time before the surgery. I went from healthy and fit to major surgery in about, 50 days (see my reverse progress pics below!). It's a lot to take in. But ultimately I think im adjusting OK. It will be great to be out of the hospital, im going past 30 days here out of the 50 since my diagnosis. Surgery recovery sucks but I guess I got the best time since its not like anyone is doing anything right now, all just sitting at home. Ill have lots of time to get better and start the basics of getting in shape again.

I am glad I posted though and glad I waited. A lot of people were telling me that they were moving me into surgery too fast, to continue on my progress, and even though surgery was the eventual outcome, they were moving too fast. Just two days after they said treatment had failed they were telling me I could leave the next day operation free. By waiting I gave myself a shot, its just a shot that didn't hit. I also now will never have doubts. I know we tried everything. It wasn't going to work, and surgery was unequivocally my only option. If I went in last weekend I never would have known, maybe that dose of remicade was the one.

So I guess thats basically it for my UC story. 50 days in and out. I know I technically still have the condition since they kept my rectum intact for a Jpouch, but in the meantime I will have to adjust to living with a pouch, and getting better from surgery.

BONUS - 45 lbs down here are my reverse progress pics. Me [ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO](https://imgur.com/a/Wgxn5kI) vs me [TWO DAYS BEFORE THE PROCEDURE](https://imgur.com/tyI60Ls)  (With only access to hospital gowns right now I cant post a pic of my upper body without being very indecent). About 185 pounds vs 140. Really sucks for me that I lost all this progress, I worked hard over 3 years to get to where I was. But muscle is always easier to regain so I think maybe a year in I can be pretty close to my old form, obviously plus one stoma.

So thats that",2020-04-28 23:44:25

The problem is, I don’t know even know if this is a UC flare? Or a intestinal infection (parasites, bacteria)? or covid-19? because I came back from India in the beginning of March. I am hoping I get the results of the stool back soon to see what’s going on.

I was actually taken off prednisone today because I started to develop a fever and heavy sweats. My partner has COVID19 symptoms and we are both getting tested tomorrow morning just in case (my doc doesn't want me on prednisone again until after I test negative). Hospitalization is still a possibility, but we'll see what happens.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi lovely folks! After being in mostly remission for years, over the course of 17 days of deterioration my doctor says I might have to be hospitalized. Has anyone been hospitalized for UC over the course of this pandemic? I know no visitors are allowed any more, how do you cope???

Also any tips on mitigating prednisone side effects would be greatly appreciated. I got all the side effects last time I was on (weight gain, mood swings, bloating, acne, etc) and it didn't work but hopefully this time it works? (I also literally just managed to clear up my skin after struggling with it for years :( the scarring was even starting to fade)

-------------------------------
(More of a side note: has anyone ever had their illness deteriorate this quickly out of nowhere? Like usually I get a few ""warning shots"" (pain in my left side, loose stool) that I know I have to adjust my meds/lifestyle but this was just sudden stomach pain (which I've never had) and then a few days later liquid stool 10+times a day. It's unusual for me because I've always had left-sided and rectal inflammation first and then when it gets REALLY bad (after a few months), it goes to the entire colon and now my entire colon is inflamed (according to CT) and the pain is COMPLETELY different than normal. We've done all the bacterial cultures and it all came back neg... There's also zero blood and mucus, which is entirely bizarre for me)",2020-04-28 14:50:31

I originally posted this in an IBS subreddit, but someone suggested I might have UC, so I’m just looking to gather as much info as possible.

This may be too much information/gross, but I began to see blood in my stool back in October so I went to my doctor who suggested I take a laxative to loosen my stools. That didn’t work and I kept bleeding, I also noticed mucus in my stools. I went back to the doctor who suggested I take a laxative every other day instead of taking  it everyday. I then began to notice that my stools were becoming extremely urgent and violent. I went back to the doctor who then scheduled me for a colonoscopy, however, since the pandemic began all offices have been closed. I called my doctor back and she said that my case isn’t an emergency so I’ll have to wait. So since I’m in a holding pattern, I was certain that I do have IBS as I have a rumbling and burning feeling in my stomach as well, but I’m not sure if these are actually symptoms of UC. I’m taking peppermint oil capsules and waiting to see how that goes. I’m also trying the low FODMAP diet. I’ve eliminated quite a lot of high FODMAP foods from my diet, but I have yet to see any changes in my bowel habits. I will admit that every now and then I will have a small piece of high FODMAP food, does even a little bit of FODMAP make a difference? Does anyone have any further advice for me? I know I’m not yet a confirmed case, but I really don’t think it’s Cronh’s, although I’m aware it could be anything. Any advice is appreciate and so are any comments. Thank you for reading

&nbsp;


**Question**



How should patients on immunosuppressive therapy be advised during the COVID-19 pandemic?


&nbsp;



**Answer**


In general, those patients who have not tested positive, have not been exposed, and are asymptomatic should continue their medications as prescribed.





The American College of Rheumatology issued [a statement](https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/ACR-COVID-19-Clinical-Guidance-Summary-Patients-with-Rheumatic-Diseases.pdf) on April 14, recommending that stable patients continue their medications. Those with known exposure but without confirmed infection may continue hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and NSAIDs.



Immunosuppressants, non–IL-6 biologics, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped temporarily, pending a negative test or after two weeks without symptoms. In patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 infection, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, immunosuppressants, non-IL-6 biologics, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped temporarily, pending a negative test or after two weeks without symptoms. In patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 infection, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, immunosuppressants, non-IL-6 biologics, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped temporarily. Anti-malarial therapies (hydroxycholoroquine and chloroquine) may be continued and IL-6 inhibitors may be continued in select circumstances.^1



The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that the discussion of continuation of biologics be based on a case-by-case basis, citing insufficient evidence to recommend against discontinuation at this time in those patients who have not tested positive. In patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 it is recommended that biologic therapy be suspended until symptoms have resolved.^2

I have been blessed in SO many ways and have had a lot of positive changes as a result. But thats not why we're here, is it. Heres a synopsis of every month thus far, each worse than the last.
January- start flaring. Diagnosed with UC via colonoscopy a week before my birthday. Significant pain and distress every day.
February- symptoms worsening significantly, no relief from steroid enemas x3 weeks so far. Also, as we all know, COVID hits us big time.
March- symptoms keep... getting... worse. No longer able to do my job (ER nurse) due to severity of disease and overall risk of infection with c.diff. on steroids and feel yucky. And now on disability and in the depths of the worst depression of my life.
April- things might be looking up? Now on rectal mesalamine and steroids, starting to have relief! Unfortunately no luck on the job front, little stressed financially. Think to myself maybe ill be okay. ....
Until today. Broke my leg. Felt ok for once in a while, headed out for some social distance activity, and BAM. 
So here i am, splint and crutches, praying to the gods i dont have to rush to the restroom at a moments notice. 
Oh, and did i mention im starting immunosuppressants in the next week or so, in the midst of a pandemic? Totally not worried. /s

My condition has improved but was already improving on the prednisone. Last week I was on 30mg and yesterday I stepped down to 25.  Again my condition is stable and improving. 

I live in Colorado so it might be my environment but I’ve had some throat irritation the last two days. I say this because Colorado is D R Y. My god...so dry. Anyway, I don’t normally have allergies but on pred and stelara I wonder if I’m reacting to the plants that are beginning to bloom in earnest when normally i wouldn’t be bothered at all. I don’t feel sick. Just feel like I have gunk I need to clear out of my throat. 

I was contacted by the pharmacy to arrange my first injection, which should arrive this week but I’m scheduled to take 7 weeks from now. Copay wasn’t what I’m used to (much higher) but it’s still a fraction of the cost of the drug. I’m grateful to have decent insurance. 

No other issues to speak of. Hopeful to continue improving and keeping this damned ulcer under control moving fwd.

About 3 times over the past few years I have had some GI issues. 

A month ago I  had roughly a 5 day bout of watery diarrhea and on about the 3rd day I had some blood drip into the toilet after the diarrhea came out. There was some mucus looking stuff. Also as my stools began to harden I noticed they were floating at first then slowly sinking.

 The diarrhea was pretty smelly. I noticed warm showers didn’t help much but I found out the bath was amazing and would stop the urgent need to run to the bathroom, literally run. A little cramping then immediate GOTTA GO! 

I should note that before this started I ate 5 full butcher sized ribeye steaks over the course of about a week. Could this have been the cause? Or was this a UC flare?

2887,"I really need help, migraines!",ArsenicInTeacups,3,gb0zmc,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/gb0zmc/i_really_need_help_migraines/,6,"Hey everyone, I've started to write out posts here a few times and always end up chickening out. However, I've become pretty desperate, so here I am! 
I was diagnosed in 2018 with UC after being brushed off for 8 MONTHS (""are you sure you didn't just have rough anal sex?"" ""It's probably a hemorrhoid!"" ... Bastards.) Anyway, it's been a battle. I'm currently in a flair that I've been fighting since last summer. Issues with insurance and a traumatic doctor experience (long story) made treating it difficult and I've finally started to establish a new team of care, but due to Covid 19, you guys know the rest. I'm waiting for my referral to Mayo in Rochester to call and get me scheduled and I am hoping that actually gives me a fighting chance. Now, onto the issue:
I've gotten migraine headaches since I was 12 years old (now 27). Not knowing better growing up, when I'd notice one coming on, I'd take a massive dose of Advil and hope it did the trick. It always did. Now, with the UC, I know that's really not a good choice. So once I finally was diagnosed and still would get migraines a few times a month, I was in a bit of a pickle. I'll say this right off the bat, Tylenol will not TOUCH these headaches. I have tried. I've tried so many different kinds. Currently I have a stocked cupboard of Tylenol 8 Hour, Tylenol Headache and Migraine, Percogesic, and some good ole fashion generic acetaminophen tablets in case I have a sense of humor. The only things that have put a dent in any of my pain (the general UC pain or the headache pain) are combining the first two, a hot and cold pack, and praying for mercy. But these migraines, guys... I can't even. Several months ago I was getting them 3-4 days a week. I was missing work, I couldn't function. I've brought this issue up to three different doctors. One said ""too bad, take Tylenol"", the second one was so awful I won't even get into her, and the third (this most recent)  finally listened and has me taking 20mg of amitriptyline. Which helps significantly 🙌. I now only get them a few times a month. Now, that's the treatment for my migraines alone. 
The ultra shitty part of all this is that any time I've taken medicine geared towards my UC, I've gotten headaches. It's like clockwork. The Mesalamine was the worst of them, but you get the idea. It's like I drew the lucky winning card and now have both of these medical issues that DO NOT want to play together, whatsoever. And I need help figuring out what to do, because I've now received (in a way) an intervention. Last night was hell for me. I started to feel pain in the back of my neck and in my eyebrows, which has been my telltale sign of doom for the last few years. It takes literally 20 minutes from 'first contact' to 'hulk mode', it happens so quickly. Last night was the worst I've had in a long while. I was actually fading in and out of being 'there' (disassociating, I guess), and I was screaming and crying from pain. When these migraines happen,I go to a really dark place (literally and figuratively). I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts and I have since I was young. The pain gets so bad in my head that I can only think about finding a way to make it stop, no matter how drastic it is. For these monster migraines, I finally need to give in and take Advil to have a fighting chance of making it through them. It will absolutely f--- up my UC for days, but for the pain of the migraine, I have needed to accept the trade off. 
I can't do this anymore, guys. I'm exhausted. Im starting to hate my life (which sucks because my SO is amazing and we are planning on getting engaged and buying a house in the next few months, SO much excitement to look forward to!) Every day I wake up wondering which battle I'm going to fight, migraine or UC, and in fighting one I end up messing with the other. I've tried researching as much as I can but the answers I get range from ""Tylenol"" to ""tough sh*t"" and I can't accept that. This can't be all that my life is going to be. So I need some help, advice, suggestions, support... Anything. This subreddit has given me so much strength and the ability to laugh at myself and take things in stride, but I can't do this. Thank you in advance for reading, I look forward to whatever you are willing to offer. Take care everyone, stay safe. 🌻",2020-04-30 20:13:10

SO basically I have had issues since in was a young teenager( i'm 30 now), constant horrible pain and diarrhea you know the drill. I have all the classic symptom's of UC plus my dad has it. I saw my first GI 5 years ago, did a colonoscopy and he found a ""punctuate erosion"" in the terminal ileum biopsy it and everything came back normal. at my follow up he basically told me "" I dunno what I can do for you take Imodium."" Needless to say I was upset and basically gave up and decided to live with my pain and constant ""D"" and i like to call it. Now 5 years later, still dealing with my constant struggles I went to do a routine blood test ( I happened to be having a bad flair of symptoms"") and my iron came back extremely low so my GP asked if my periods were still very heavy? I said no actually I haven't have a period is almost 2 years ( other issues on hormones to stop it until baby time ). He said he suggested for me to have a colonoscopy as he suspected me to be bleeding somewhere due to the super low iron.

Basically i'm just feeling like i'm going to go through all the horrible prep and everything of the colonoscopy just to be told nothing is wrong with me. Honestly as sad as it is I would love a diagnosis just to get on the road to feeling better, and not having to keep track of the nearest backroom at all times. Did anyone else have a hard time getting diagnosed or did it take a long time?

But basically I got diagnosed in December 2019 after my symptoms got really out of hand (I stupidly ignored them for about a year before). Got it control with IV pred and Remicade. During this period they ran CT scans and incidentally found a tumor on my R kidney. I was booked in for tumor removal. During this time I also struggled with my UC and struggled to wean off prednisone oral dose. Considering this the doctors thought it would be good idea to do an end ileostomy and kidney tumor removal surgery at the same time. I reluctantly agreed so I was booked for that.

Now knowing that I was having an operation anyway for my UC, I decided to ease off on the strict diet I was on. I started eating normally during this time. And also wanting to be off prednisone as soon as possible after surgery, I began tapering off aggressively since I didn't really care if my UC went bad a little bit since I was home in the lock down and colon was coming out anyway.

But funny thing happened during this time that despite going to normal diet and tapering off prednisone, I UC started to improve. This made no sense to me and left me double minded on the surgery. Day before the surgery I was admitted and spoke to the gastro surgeon the evening before. I told her my symptoms were improving but also that I'd trust her opinion on weather to go for surgery or not. She wasn't sure either way so consulted another gastro. Between them they both agreed that surgery should be the absolute last resort and that I basically deserved a chance since symptoms were improving. We ended up with the kidney surgery only with my gastro (who was booked for my surgery) basically on the standby.

Since that surgery 3 weeks ago I've had another dose of Remicade and continue to taper off prednisone (currently 15mg, lowest I've ever been on). Colonoscopy yesterday showed the colon was healing as there were visible pseudopolyps. This to the gastro is a sign of healing.

I'm now basically at a point that I don't think diet has much play on my UC. Is this even possible? I though diet was a major factor. If it's not diet then what else could it be? I want to do everything possible to get to and stay in remission but at the moment I'm confused on what I can do proactively. 

On these 'pseduopolyps' seen in colonscopy.. what's been your experience? have you had them? how long did it take to go from these polyps to remission?",2020-04-30 04:55:25

He went through that with zero improvement other than he stopped running a low fever. His doctor then put him on a month of prednisone. He’s on day 9 of that and has still not improved. He’s lost 20 pounds and has lost a ton of blood obviously. I got ahold of his doctor today and they scheduled him for a colonoscopy on the 7th. He indicated that the next step after would be to put him on a biologic. We know nothing about this type of treatment but I know there’s a lot to be concerned about. He can’t continue to live in the state he is in so I don’t think he has an option. I guess what I’m hoping for is education on what works and doesn’t work or tips on what to ask about or be concerned about. I don’t want to Google because I don’t need that level of anxiety right now. I appreciate any input especially knowing how much you all go through!


Update: My husbands doctor called back today after his colonoscopy yesterday. He upped his steroid to 50mg a day until he’s under control. Thank goodness! He has to get some blood work done this coming week and then they will let him know when to come in for his first Remicade infusion. Why they didn’t draw blood while they had him is a question but oh well. Hopefully he will get his first infusion later next week. So thankful for all the support you all have given!

I’ve simply lost control. Yesterday during the day I relieve myself in my own shorts three times. Not being able to make it to the bathroom in time. Then again last night twice when I woke up rushing to the bathroom but unfortunately didn’t make it in time.

Main question is does anybody have a trick on how to hold in your poop before it comes out against your will? I remember back in the day when I had control I could hold it but now I simply lose control and it comes out. I’ve tried everything from holding my butt hole to trying to breathe in and everything in between. Any suggestions?

Figured I'd share this.

I was having a mild flare (left sided colitis only) that was dragging on far too long compared to normal. I was beginning to think my Mesalamine oral + enema wasn't working as it had last time. 

I normally don't have much issue and the drugs bring everything under control fairly quickly.

About a week ago I realized the Hibiscus Tea I drink daily actually is known to make anti inflammatory medicine much less effective. I cut the tea and the mesalamine+ started to slowly improve my symptoms as normal. 

This is worth noting because Hibiscus hot/iced tea is actually available commonly, you can even order it at Starbucks.

Forgive me if this is common knowledge but I had no idea and I can't be the only one who enjoys an iced hibiscus tea.

I have been have very bad pain after going to toilet for whole 3 months about 5 times a day. I did weigh about 75 kg and was pretty sporty but now im down to 59 and can barely climb up to 5th floor.

I have read a lot about colectomy and if any other medicine wont help I will consider it more. Is anybody body here that have had colectomy? Would love to hear any experiences and stories about it.

Based on this, I’m thinking I do need to refill the meds and resume after the break, which would have be back on for about 3 weeks by the time I  see the doc again.

I had all the bad symptoms of bloody diarrhea for 2 months straight, pain, etc. 

After being diagnosed I was prescribed prednisone. For the first time in my life I felt I shouldn’t take a medicine prescribed by a doctor. Can’t really explain why I just knew it would be bad for me. I also have residual side effects from the Ciprofloxacin (look up floxies, a group of people affected by Cipro) and steroids are contraindicated for it, usually makes symptoms worse, not always but... it’s there. I felt it wouldn’t be good for me so I declined.

I searched up a YouTube video about a guy who “healed” his UC through diet and repopulating the gut microbiome. I decided to follow it and see where it gets me.

So 2 weeks out following this diet, my stool is back to normal, as in I go once every 2 days (maybe I’m constipated now but def better than 10 times a day) it’s back to solid, no blood, no pain. I still feel tenderness and I can kinda “feel” where the ulcers are in my tract. I heard it takes awhile for ulcers to go away so I guess I’ll have to deal with it. But it’s not active pain anymore it’s more tenderness and discomfort. I haven’t taken any medication and just basically eat steamed zucchini, tumeric rice, and baked chicken for breakfast and dinner. I do the intermittent fasting and skip lunch. I’ve had a few “cheat” days where I grab a bagel from Dunkin’ Donuts for lunch but it hasn’t affected me. I also drink a lot of kefir both morning and night. I also am trying to add fermented vegetables like cabbage into my diet. 

So it’s kinda been working out for me. But then again it’s only been 2 weeks but I figure I would give an update. My plan is to keep doing this if I’m experiencing no bad symptoms. If my symptoms get really bad I guess I’ll take the prednisone but for now, I’ll stick with this.

Mesalamine 800 mg twice daily (stay on this permanently I think) 

Pantoprazole 40 mg (another month of this I think)

Prednisone 20 mg (Started off at 50, dropping 10 mg a week until quiting)

So far the treatment has been going very well, I feel like I did before the symptoms started (no blood/cramping, can eat the same foods as before, etc).

i'm a 20 yr old who just got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. like JUST diagnosed, came from my GI visit today. i feel really empty inside.

i've been dealing with gastrointestinal issues since summer of 2019 and it's been so infuriating!! i've been lead back and forth between possible diagnoses and at this point i started wondering whether i was just going crazy, overreacting, etc.

i thought it was a stomach ulcer first, possibly stomach cancer, then crohns/UC, then colon cancer, and so on. the ""cancer"" possibilities scared me the most. got a serious case of webMD googling, so i'd often google and re-google every symptom i was feeling. as a tiiiiny disclaimer, i know that its well known for google to incite cancer fears in symptoms that could be from something way less serious, but having a sister who was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of six kind of instilled a fear that yknow, hey, anything can happen. 

after my colonoscopy (which i was terrified to have but *somewhat* relieved to find out was not as bad as expected), i long awaited my biopsy results to return and a little curious as to what it could be, as my GI called my colon ""underwhelming"" (lol) and that he only saw a little inflammation in my rectum that could be from proctitis. of course, i googled everything there was to know about proctitis and assumed myself that it HAD to be from the antibiotics i had taken months prior to get rid of a possible ulcer.

for the past few months my symptoms have slightly changed here and there, which has only caused more frustration for me as i found it hard to talk about how i was feeling each visit. what started out as sharp stomach pains and heartburn evolved into primarily intestinal issues involving urgent need to go, constipation in the form of like, straining to have a bowel movement despite feeling the need, nausea, lack of appetite, some small weight loss, and a kind of weird pain/pressure/tenderness combo on the right(?) side of my abdomen. the most recent and debilitating developed symptom, however, was the appearance of massive cramps every time i need to poop. like they feel like top-level menstrual camps kind of cramping. or like when you eat the absolute worst thing and have massive diarrhea. really bad.

saw my doc today finally and while i am very relieved to finally have a diagnosis and not feel like i'm going crazy anymore, i didn't get the diagnosis i was expecting, or wanted. doc looked at my biopsy results and bloodwork and determined that i had a form of UC involving proctitis. (ulcerative proctitis?) he kept vehemently insisting that it was a very *MILD* form of UC and that it could be very treatable. i began to feel a little frustrated as i thought no matter how mild the form is, my symptoms definitely don't feel mild. :/

he wants me to start a regimen of pills and enema kits every single day for three months to heal the proctitis after i give a stool sample to test for calprotectin. it's more than a little intimidating. not sure how i'm going to manage giving myself an enema every single day...for three months... in college :///

&#x200B;

curious as to what others think in terms of how enema kits for managing UC goes and i appreciate any support given :') i know at some point i'll be able to accept needing to deal with this for the rest of my life but right now its a little hard to think positively about it",2020-03-05 06:42:39

I've seen many posts of people who are worried about Corona and I was pretty worried myself, so I talked to my GI yesterday about the additional risk for us. I thought I'd share what he said because maybe it helps some of you as well, and ask you to share some expert opinions as well. Of course he's not an expert on Corona, but he's been a GI for 30 years, so I trust him to be able to calculate the risk.

Basically, he told me that having UC and even taking one immunosuppressant (azathioprine in my case) does not significantly increase our risk if we catch Corona, even if we are currently flaring (I am). According to him, we are more likely to catch it, but it shouldn't be much more dangerous to us than it is to everyone else.

There is an increased risk if you take more than one immunosuppressant (e.g. aza + prednisone + remicade). Those of you who do should be a bit more careful and make sure to take immediate action if you think you might have it. It's not an immediate death sentence either though, just make sure you receive proper care as soon as possible.

I really hope this helps some of you - of course this is only what my doctor said, so it's certainly not as reliable as a study would be, but I found it helpful. If you have already talked to your doctor as well, it would be great if you left a comment so we can collect some expert opinions in this thread. If you have found statements from virologists on the internet or something, please add them as well! I've just seen a lot of people speculating regarding how Corona might affect us lately and I want to make sure we have some more reliable information than what's in the newspapers. With the commenters' permission, I'll collect your comments and links below.

Comment by /u/ellelitellelit

> I called my doctor and she said that immunosuppressed patients are at greater risk, but that there's not much you can do to protect yourself beyond limiting social contact and using good hygiene practices. She didn't seem worried.

Comment by /u/ShadowedPariah

> I had UC, had surgery, and also had a liver transplant (still technically have a small amount of UC left). I've traveling to CA for a vacation in June. The transplant team wasn't worried about it despite my heavy suppression for chronic rejection. They just said to keep up on hand washing as much as possible.

They also asked me to remind you that it's still worth asking your doctor/team about the situation. I just want to mention that I completely agree, this post is of course *not* supposed to replace actual medical advice from your doctor.

Comment by /u/Restless_Fillmore

> My doctor said that there was a definite concern if there an outbreak near here. He told me I should wear a mask, as I would have a difficult time fighting it off with azathioprine. I don't have his source on that, nor what his background is relative to pandemics.

> I think he's been practicing about 25 years.

Comment by /u/KrAzyDrummer

> For what it's worth, I work in a GI clinic with IBD specialists and their recommendation is more or less the same as your GI.

> Keep taking your meds, wash your hands, don't touch your face, etc. There isn't really much else that can be recommended for patients specifically with IBD, just the same general infection deterring practices.

So I had to provide a stool sample today, testing for calprotectin + elastase. I wanted to make sure that I was going to be able to shit first thing in the morning (as I have been having some constipation issues w/ my ulcerative proctitis), so I bought a glass of starbucks coffee the night before. Drank most of it this morning, but I didn't eat or drink anything else. Big fucking mistake!!

I was able to get my stool sample, but once I started going it hasn't been stopping since. About 15 mins after I secured the sample I had to go again. Thought this was normal, as for the past few days I've been having about 2-3 bowel movements a day, which is pretty manageable.

Of course halfway through driving to the hospital to drop off my sample, urge came back. And I'm sure most of you know, it's that 0 to 100% kind of urgency. I really crown myself a champ for being able to hold it for so long, lol. Of course luck was not on my side as traffic was slow and the parking lot was full. Then there was extra security to go through due to coronavirus protocols. I was so tempted to just run by them and yell ""I HAVE IBD GIVE ME A MOMENT"" like god!!

Managed to make it to the bathroom inside, third BM. Checked in, waited in outpatient. Fourth BM. Along with the urgency due to the fact I only had coffee, I'm having nausea, acid reflux, I'm shaky, I'm sweating. Looked like a real fuckin mess. Managed to drop off the sample and make it back to my apartment safe and sound. Fortunately I'm all alone so I'm happily sitting on my throne with heating pad and lots of water, finally able to shit in peace. I know 4 (now 5) bowel movements in the morning is a better day for some of you, but for me this is a lot. Wondering if anybody had some tips to help with my bad flare today? Thinking of taking tums for my acid reflux. Dunno what I should eat that'll be easy on my stomach.

Just started my period today and as I expected, it's exactly what I was fearing. Menstrual cramps are out the door beating my ass, day one.

Mind you I've had a history of horrible horrible periods since I started getting them right before the start of middle school. They've always been super heavy, last 7-8 days, and the worst part is I'd regularly experience extreme *extreme* cramping for the first three days. Just unrelenting, searing stabbing cramping pain that'd last for 3-6, sometimes 7-8 hours. I've thrown up from the pain multiple times, and I've passed out once.

Fortunately for a while I was able to almost rid myself of these symptoms when I was put on birth control around high school. Periods shortened to 3-4 days, much much lighter, and I had very light cramping.

Fast forward to now and while my periods have stayed relatively light, they're getting longer again and the cramping has returned full force. Previously the only medication that would alleviate my cramps would be Motrin, but now with my new UC diagnosis I'm not sure if I can take it anymore. I do sincerely try to avoid NSAIDs whenever I can and use other methods to relieve pain, but when it comes to period cramps nothing else helps. I'm just asking would it be the *end of the world* if I took Motrin for the 2-3 days on my period? Would that cause any serious complications? As an addition I just recently started taking Lialda pills and I'll be soon doing mesalamine enema kits every night.

I've told my doctor about my worsening menstrual cycles and he does believe it could be due to the fact I'm in a UC flare-up right now. I do believe him but I also wonder if it could be also something else at work, or if my birth control has simply stopped working as well for me. I do have thoughts of endometriosis in the back of my mind, particularly because I fit many of the risk factors for it. Nothing much else I can do about that though until I see my OBGYN for an annual March 30th.

Any answers are greatly appreciated, and here's hoping I can get these cramps back under control soon ://",2020-03-10 17:52:21

I started thinking about what could have set off a flare and/or what helped resolve it because it didn't feel like I had changed much environmentally and just recently was tested to confirm humira is working well for me. 
I realized I started using CBD+MCT oil to help my joint pain (which worked wonders) at the time I started having flare symptoms, and stopped taking the oil around the same time the flare started to resolve. 
Other forms of cbd without MCT don't seem to bother me, so I tried to research the link between MCT oil and flaring but didn't find much. I emailed my doctor about it and I'm waiting for a response, but I was wondering in the meantime if any of you had had similar problems with MCT oil? Or maybe this was just a coincidence?

I feel like I have tried everything already. I changed my diet, tried several different medications, went on steroids, tried probiotics, and even changed my GI doctor but nothing had worked. I am in my junior year of high school and everything is so stressful. I have my ACT coming up soon and I don’t feel like I’ll be able to do as well as I could if I wasn’t in this stupid flare. I have some accommodations but ACT and college board aren’t giving me all of them. I already applied for reconsideration and they don’t even care. During several of my practice tests something has gone wrong because of this flare and I am really worried that the same will happen for the teal thing so I really need all of those accommodations. Also, because of the coronavirus, all the fun events in school have been cancelled but because I go to a public school they won’t close. Now I’m only left with the most stressful parts of school. I see a psychologist to help me manage my stress normally. Typically though, singing is what really calms me down. Music has always been a big part of my life and singing has gotten me through so much. But now I feel like it’s not working. My throat has recently been really sore and both my choir trip and choir concert got cancelled because of the coronavirus so now when I sing, I can’t help but be reminded of all of these bad things. I feel like nothing can help me anymore and I with junior year I feel so upset and disappointed with myself because of this flare. While I know it’s not my fault, I also know that I am capable of so much more and could’ve done so much better if I wasn’t in a flare for basically my entire junior year (even though it hasn’t ended yet, I feel like this flare will probably stay through the rest of it at this point).  I feel like so many bad things have happened recently. I remember in the beginning of 2019, several bad things happened and the entire year I just remember asking for something good or for a win. But during New Year’s Eve, someone asked what was the most memorable part of 2019. I had to excuse myself and literally cried afterwards because all I could think of were all the bad memories and things that happened. I couldn’t think of a single good memorable thing in 2019. The fact that it had been an entire year since I had been asking for something good to happen and it didn’t just tore me apart. Now, after a few months into 2020, I still feel like nothing good as happened. I feel like everything has piled up and I no longer know what to do. I just feel defeated. Because of how many bad things have happened to me, both my friends and family consider me a jinx or say that I’m cursed or karma or I have the worst luck or something. Imagine how many bad things have to happen for everyone you know to consider you to have the worst luck. That’s crazy to me! Like I don’t want to be known for having bad things happen to me. I complain so often now that even I get annoyed at myself. But when so many bad things keep happening to you, it’s hard to not complain about them. I just really don’t know what to do anymore. So many bad things have happened and even if everything isn’t fixed, I just want for this flare to go away. At the very least I want my flare to go away. That is something I would consider good and a win.

TL:DR 
Bowels messed up by antibiotics off my infusions for a month will things improve swiftly once I start then up again (every 2weeks) sorry for long rambling post day 5 of very little sleep 


Looking to see if someone has been in a similar situation..

I've been on Humira for 12 months and apart from some unpleasant side effects I'm pretty happy as it's got me from 24 bm per day down to 1 or 2 - result! 

However This year  I've had tonsillitis twice - once in feb and again this month.

Last time I had it I stopped my humira and resumed 4 days after I had finished my antibiotics (5 working day response time on my IBD nurse line who when phoned me back told me I should have waited 7 days and to do so in the future) 

Few weeks ago started getting ear pain went to the docs said tonsils were inflamed but no pus so to gargle take paracetamol and throat spray. Did this but symptoms got worse and on going back was now pus and looking worse so got prescribed Clarithromycin (am allergic to penicillin) for 5 days. Didn't take my humira injection as advised. By day 4 the pain was a lot worse, had spread to my sinuses and jaw/ teeth and I hadn't managed any solid food and was taking as many painkillers as I possibly could (bad idea but was desperate). Stomach was starting to get worse with Diarrhea and pain but compared to the other pain it was the lesser of 2 evils. In the end I got hospitalised as the infection had spread and got put on IV Clarithromycin and Metronidazole alongside some steroids and oral pub relief. Whilst this has massively helped with the tonsillitis and pain whilst in hospital my bowel started getting a lot worse and am now back up to 8bm a day and in a lot of pain including in my back. Hospital was not where my gastro team is based so couldn't get a consult with them whilst inpatient and the nurses I asked weren't sure (lovely though I love the NHS)

I have another 5 days of tablet antiobiotics to take and as long as I a symptom free will resume humira after the advised 7 days.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation and did the resumption of their medication eliminate any flare symptoms quickly? I will contact my IBD team but it's a week response time and I'm stuck up at 2:30 bloated in pain and getting up and down to go to the loo again.

Sorry for the super long post I will add a TLDR at the beginning I think (if I can understand that correctly) And any insight would be really appreciated!",2020-03-12 03:27:15

I had a decent job, good amount of balance between work and play. About 1.5 years ago, I took a leap of faith and started working at a startup. And while I’ve grown A LOT professionally and as a person, this new gig has been incredibly high stress, long hours, on call all the time, and frankly a rather toxic work environment. And yep, you guessed it, it triggered a flare up, which I ignored for several months until I finally gave up the denial. I’ve been working hard to balance my job with my health - I got back on mesalamine and really cleaned up my diet. I’m back to solid stool but still seeing blood and mucous. My GI thinks I’m nuts for working at my current job and now I basically have two choices in front of me - 

1) quit my job and recover with mesalamine (I have some savings that can keep me afloat for a little bit) or 2) keep the job but get onto Remicade (which can cause birth defects) right as my partner and I start to consider having a family.

I had a stupid bad fall due to some surface imperfection making me lose my balance. I fell on the side of top of my femur and my femoral head literally entered my hip and broke my acetabular and caused a second fracture on my ischium (if I'm not wrong).


I had a first surgery when I arrived in the ER to put some rod in my tibia so they can put some traction on my leg and have my femoral head freed and the fractured reduced.


Monday, I will have my surgery to put plates and rods and so repair the damage as there was a displacement.


So since 6 days I'm in my bed without any possibility of getting out and mostly am flat as I can't move my leg. I'm really happy I am under corticoids and don't have a flare at the moment. I still have the humiliating and disgusting experience of having horrible stinking muddle poop at least once a day while in bed (it's quite good that psychological blockings have diminished my pooping requirements atm but I don't think it will last as my gut is in constant turmoil).


My country (in Europe) is now entering a new phase of anti-corona propagation and no visits will be allowed anymore in the hospital and all non urgent appointments are cancelled during the next weeks.

It's quite interesting to being here at the moment as I can feel the shift in the medical personnel views and thoughts regarding covid19.

The hospital is also one of those that will take care of Corona virus patients. I hope to safely be able to see the process in the coming week.

2. If you are taking steroids (prednisone/prednisolone) for any reason, be sure to take extra precautions by following the CDC’s recommendations for risk reduction and talk to your healthcare provider, because steroids can suppress your immune system. 
**Please discuss with your healthcare provider options to lower your dose or get off steroids (which is always a recommendation in managing IBD).**

3. Immunomodulators like thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclosporine, methotrexate), and the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) tend to inhibit the body’s immune response to viral infections 
**Do not stop taking these medications. If you have concerns, talk to your provider.**

And when they finally DO send the refill instructions (1in the morning 1 at bedtime) the pharmacy needs clarification because of the way the doctor wrote it. 

They say it's not recommended to cut up the suppositories, but I'm kinda desperate and they have been helping me sleep through the night. Has anyone else tried it? If I so much as miss a night bc I run out I'm in excruciating pain the next morning and my ass feels swollen shut.

I've been flaring for over a year and after a stint in hospital and a month on no residue and changing from humira to remicade signs are good I may be recovering. 


So anyhow as I now have a very basic diet I have been finding it easier to finally notice the impact of certain foods on the way I feel. Up until recently I felt like shit whatever I ate so that made it impossible.

My nickname is Jonny orange. I love Oranges. Until I got UC I ate at least one orange a day from the age of 20 to 46. If I didn't get my orange my body would say where's my orange! I craved them badly.

So yesterday craving an orange I ate one. This is the first orange I have eaten outside of my year long flare. Within an hour I knew it was a mistake.

The usual stomach and toilet issues but also dizziness, hot sweats and generally feeling unwell lasted for about 4 hours.

Amazing to think one food can have such an impact. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

Is is the citrus, the fibre. Did my body reject Oranges after so long. I often wonder if my orange obsession somehow caused the whole thing. 

Anyhow I guess I'm just Jonny now.",2020-03-13 06:40:34

No complications yet (hoping not to jinx) but the taper went well and I’m still holding up. 

The question is, how can I tell if it’s Imuran or Remicade making me better, or possibly both? Cause I’d love to eliminate as many unnecessary meds as I can. 

Also I stayed pretty healthy throughout the taper and still maintaining even a week of no prednisone. Do you think I would have already gone downhill by now if it was only the prednisone keeping me healthy and not the other meds?",2020-03-13 06:30:42

Scheduled to get married May 21st and then go on a cruise for honeymoon. I have ulcerative colitis and take 2 immunosuppressants for it.  So basically if I get coronavirus, then I am more likely to have serious complications.  Not supposed to be traveling.  Trying to decide whether to cancel cruise now or wait and see if it gets better. Cruise line is being more lenient as far as cancellation policies so we technically do have some time but I’m just kind of ready to pull the plug.  Worried that if I cancel now, I’ll regret it but I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry.  Just so so upset and that doesn’t even come close to how I feel.  

Also not sure if the wedding is going to happen like we want it.  I don’t want people to get sick and then it’ll be my fault because they traveled for my wedding.  My fiancé says that we just tell everyone to use their best judgement so that it’s their decision whether to come or not.

I thought it was just my Celiac and I was having a weird reaction to something (even though I was very careful with not eating gluten). Before I had my infectious inflammatory colitis, I was having really bad back pain in my hip. I went to my GP and he just gave me stretches...even though the pain felt internal. I went to my GYNO to make sure it wasn’t a cyst. During this time I was also having stomach pains to which the ER diagnosed as an ulcer. I then had a CT scan, to see if it was a kidney stone that was causing my hip pain. They saw two small ones, but also told me that I had colitis and to call my GI. When I had my appointment for the GI, she ordered a stool sample. That night the pain in my stomach and all over became unbearable. Luckily, a family member is an ER surgeon and I made sure that I went and saw him. He told me that my CT scan showed that the colitis was actually really bad. Turns out that I had food poisoning and that was cleared up by taking an antibiotic. When I had my colonoscopy a few weeks later, the Dr stated that there was still a spot of colitis exactly where I had been having pain for months. She stated that it was inflammatory infectious colitis started with the food poisoning.

Fast forward a year, I’ve had pain in the same exact spot in my hip. The last few days my BM are becoming more frequent and more loose.

3110,UC newbie,Nonsensical_Rambles,6,fisfz6,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/fisfz6/uc_newbie/,4,"Hi all! 
Unfortunately, yesterday i became a member of the UC club. I've been okay with accepting it so far, i think i had a strong inclination it would be UC. I just wanted to give a bit of a detailed description of my journey because while i was lurking on this sub sometimes id have questions about processes but was too scared to ask just in case i didn't get diagnosed and looked like a hypochondriac plus obviously it's always best to wait for a doctor to diagnose you but i feel if i'd have been able to see someone else's journey then i'd have been a bit more at ease during the different steps! 

My journey:
My symptoms consisted of: sudden urgency, drastic change in stool consistency, increased frequency of BMs (i went from going every 2-3 days to suddenly needing to go 4-5 times a day), left sided abdominal pain and the passing of lots of blood and mucous every day/ with every BM. I had to have bloods done and provide stool samples. I believe my bloods came back normal but my stool sample got tested for Calprotectin which had a value of >1000. I started lurking around this sub in November after i attended the doctors appointment and the doctor mentioned the possibility of it being UC. 

I'd never really heard of UC before so i wanted to do some research and see what i could potentially be in for. 

I got referred to a gastroenterologist in January who explained i'd require a colonoscopy, which i had done yesterday. I was sent the Moviprep (it tasted DISGUSTING) im very glad this community exists because i followed your great tips: Use a straw to try to avoid it touching the taste buds too much; grab some wipes; grab a barrier cream to soothe the burning butthole; drink plenty of yummy clear fluids (i see you guys favour gatorade but im UK based so opted for lucozade); have access to some form of entertainment to pass the time! 

The colonoscopy:
After the nurse asked me general questions i was then fitted with a cannula and changed into the gown ready for the procedure. I had it with sedation but here in the UK the sedation means you'll be conscious but very relaxed and you can have painkiller(gas and air) if you wish. The procedure  itself wasn't entirely a success, for some reason the prep hadn't fully worked on me so i wasn't completely clear (if anyone could explain why this may have happened then please do! I followed all the instructions and drunk all of that awful stuff) this meant that my entire colon couldn't be examined but at least my sigmoid was clear so that could be seen (hence the doc explained id had a flexible sigmoidoscopy instead) here he could see lots of inflammation and ulcers which meant i was able to be diagnosed. He took a coupke of biopsies too which i won't get the results for for a couple of weeks. I may have to have a colonoscopy rescheduled but im unsure of that for now.

I was sent to recover, got changed and offered a tea and biscuit. I waited for my escort to arrive so i could be discharged.

I've now been prescribed with a months worth of both oral salofalk mesalazine granules and the salofalk mesalazine enemas which i have started tonight.

The granules are relatively simple to take but the enemas, again, i would like to thank this sub for your great tips: lie on your left side, squeeze the enema a little to ensure you get some of the air out, pop the enema in and squeeze then rest... squeeze then rest until it's all in: lay a towel down to make sure you don't get it on the bed sheets as it can apparently stain! Wait for 30 mins and then go to sleep to try and retain it all night. 

I'm hoping these meds work but won't fully find out until a few weeks time it seems from what i have read on here. I'm now waiting for a follow up appointment with my gastro to be able to ask some questions and see if i'll need a colonoscopy.

I hope this can calm any nerves anyone has about the process. Obviously this should not be used to self diagnose and always take the advice of your doctor and ask them questions if you still feel unsure about anything. 

I just want to thank all of you in this community who have contributed because it's helped me a lot and has meant that i haven't found this diagnosis as daunting as i would have found it if i hadn't found this sub.

My GI is trying to tell me that most people on Entyvio experience the maximum effectiveness by the time they're finished with their loading doses at 6 weeks which not only contradicts Entyvios website but also the experiences of many Entyvio users on this sub.  He's trying to tell me he doesn't think Entyvio is going to work for me because I haven't been responding to it quite yet (currently in between 3rd and 4th dose) and wants to label me a non responder to the medication.  He also doesn't want to prescribe imuran, 6-mp, or methotrexate because he says he only uses those to push people who are mildy responding to biologics over the edge to increase the likelihood of full response. 

I'm annoyed...he didn't tell me anything I didn't already learn from this sub and talks to me like I don't understand what he's saying.  He told me I only have Stelara and Xeljanz left which I've known for months.  Then told me i need to start thinking about surgery, which again, I've already been thinking about for months.  He was saying that he doesn't want to change my entyvio schedule to 4 weeks from 8 because that only helps when a patient is experiencing some kind of effectiveness with the biologic.

Since UC is an incurable disease and can cause other problems like cancer and arthritis, why is it that doctors just want you to take medication instead of removing the infected part of your body?

Between those two flares, my symptoms vanished completely and I felt perfectly healthy all the time (which is partially why it took me so long to seek out and receive a diagnosis). 

After this most recent flare, I was put on mesalamine and my symptoms improved greatly, but did not disappear. Every morning, I have two or three bowel movements - the first one is always tons of gas with very loose stool, and then the following bowel movements are much firmer and healthy seeming. All have significant urgency involved though. 

Most days after the first couple of hours in the morning, I am completely fine all day. Occasionally I will have a bad day where I have several bowel movements with pain and urgency, but for the most part, I could pass for a totally healthy person with no digestive issues. 

I’m just wondering if this is normal during “remission”, or if it means I’m in the awkward stage between a flare and remission (even though it’s been MONTHS), or if it’s indicative that another flare is lurking.",2020-03-16 18:52:04

Background:

In the past I used to have ibs, with the occasional loose stool and hard stool, but mostly regular. No significant pain or discomfort during the day. Had a rectoscopy done back then and found no signs of inflammation.

Later, I started having more loose stools which were interfering even more with my life, so I had calprotectin done twice which showed the first result slightly elevated (72), and the second within normal ranges (22). Further, I also hade a rectoscopy done then which showed no inflammation of the rectum.

Recently I had a rectoscopy done in relation to a chronic anal fissure, and it was found that I had inflammation in the rectum, Proctitis. Basically the lining was described as carmine red and inflamed, and possibly swollen.

So my question is: 

Since proctitis seems to be UC-junior, and I seem to be headed on the path of increasing inflammation - Is there a way to stop this? Has anyone gone through a similar process from healthy to sick and wished they had began on a diet change/supplement change before it got too bad?

Wash your hands and practice social distancing. It’s the most anyone can do. There’s no “special treatment” available for any at-risk group, let alone U.C. The disease isn’t very deadly.

Wanted to share my story and see if anyone has had similar issues. In December I was diagnosed with a mild/moderate case of UC after having a sigmoidoscopy. I had been having issues since around July after taking an antibiotic that seems to have induced the flare. Loose stools 2-6 times a day and a little blood here and there, which has never been much. 

I consider myself lucky that its fairly mild and my heart goes out to everyone with symptoms worse than myself. I've been taking balsalazide for around 3 months now and am two weeks into a round of mesalamine enemas, none of which are reducing the diarrhea. I've had concerns that the balsalazide may be making it worse as I am going more frequently than before taking it. Has anyone had similar issues with it? I'm worried i'm not responsive to 5-ASA's.

1.5 years after getting into remission, I'm flaring again! F this disease. I have more work to do to control this...

Hi, I don't think this will be well-received by many in this subreddit because it looks like a lot of people are on meds treating UC. But maybe it will help a few interested in knowing how diet affected my UC.

# Overview
I personally am planning to never go on any life-long medicine ever. I went the diet route and have healed my UC ""until the next flare"" which I believe will be never. I've been healthy for 6 months now. I follow dietary advice from Sally Fallon's book [*Nourishing Traditions*](https://www.amazon.com/Nourishing-Traditions-Challenges-Politically-Dictocrats/dp/0967089735). My diet focuses on foods that are easy to digest that humans have been eating for thousands of years and have proven to be nourishing to our bodies. This diet is very flexible because I can eat basically anything that humans have traditionally eaten, as long as the food is prepared in the traditional manner. For example, I try not to eat bread made with bakers yeast; I go for sourdough bread. Youtubers Kenny Honnas and Mike Merrill the Heal Your Gut Guy helped me a ton.


I had chronic constipation for at least 5 years before diagnosed with UC. Constant bloating, constant gas. Then the blood loss came and I went to urgent care. I lost 40 pounds after my diagnosis. I'm a guy, 6'0"", weighed 175 pounds and went down to 135 pounds. Diagnosed with UC at age 21, lost 30 pounds in the first month, went to 8.6 hemoglobin, needed 2 iron infusions. In UC limbo for 3 months total with no energy. I tried random diets / elimination diets, read a number of books and researched constantly, then studied ancestral diets and stuck to it, gained 30 pounds the first month, and have had no symptoms since. Absolutely no constipation either. I feel better now than I have felt in the last 5 years at least.


Let me know if you have any questions in the comments. I'm not here to defend my strategy. I can give more info on what I eat, why I eat it, my UC story, etc.

# *Edit. I am adding info to this post based on feedback in comments.*

# Ancestral Diet(s)
Links to some overview details from Weston A. Price Foundation about ancestral diets.

* [Characteristics of Traditional Diets](https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/characteristics-of-traditional-diets/)

* [Dietary Guidelines](https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/dietary-guidelines/)

I never saw these pages until now, but they do a good job of explaining high-level details about how people have eaten for thousands of years.

## My explanation of ancestral diet
The ancestral diet focuses on eating foods how they were traditionally prepared. Really it can be called ancestral diets, because every culture has a unique ancestral diet that their culture has eaten for thousands of years. I don't eat foods from one specific culture, but I make sure to use the knowledge that people have gained in how to prepare certain foods properly to my advantage.

### For example:
* Bread today is often made using baker's yeast, which is a product that was developed in the 1900s. Traditionally, all bread was leavened (risen) using a sourdough starter that not only contained yeast strains, but also other microbes that help ferment flour.
   * For this reason, I eat bread that is made with a sourdough starter rather than active dry yeast (baker's yeast).
* Milk today is often pasteurized to make the shelf life longer. Traditionally, dairy was eaten / drank raw. Also, traditionally, milk was fermented into things like cheese, yogurt, milk kefir, etc. to make the shelf life longer.
   * For this reason, I eat dairy that is raw or has been fermented. I personally ferment raw milk usually into milk kefir, but I have fermented pasteurized milk also and I have had no ill-effects. I just prefer using raw milk though because this is what is traditionally used.
* Some modern diets eat cereals or grains that are not fermented. Traditionally, almost all grains were fermented before eaten.
   * For this reason, I ferment any grains that I will eat. I ferment wheat flour into sourdough bread. I ferment oats before making oatmeal. I ferment rice before cooking it.

## What I eat today
### My diet consists mostly of the following:
* Homemade sourdough bread made with organic whole wheat flour. I eat this 1/2 times per day usually. I lather grass-fed butter on my bread or use cheese. I add raw honey sometimes, and other random things as well
* Perpetual porridge aka fermented oats made into oatmeal. I ferment oats, use some of it to make oatmeal, then add oats to a jar that perpetually ferments. I put lots of grass-fed butter in the oatmeal. I usually put a serving of fermented vegetables in the finished oatmeal. I make homemade sauerkraut, pickled beets, pickled radishes, etc. Many vegetables ferment well.
* The above two items are mostly what I eat actually. I occasionally eat different foods like eggs, homemade broths, meats, soaked / fermented brown rice, etc.
* I cheat a lot. I love dark chocolate and candy. This actually makes my poop a little softer, so it is not ideal, but absolutely nothing compared to being immobilized and shedding bloody scab tissue out my butt.
* When I eat out, I try to adhere to my diet, but really one meal of eating foods that I don't think are healthy doesn't do much bad to me. It might just make me fart a bit more.

### Foods I try to avoid
* Nuts, seeds, and grains, that are not heavily fermented. These are the worst in my opinion. I never did well with these, and traditionally, these foods almost always needed to be fermented to make them more digestible.
* I try to avoid too many seed oils. Some is fine, but should not be the bulk of the fat I get in my diet. I go for mostly animal fats like grass-fed butter and animal fat from pasture-raised animals.
* Any other foods that are not prepared how people prepared them for thousands of years.

As some of you may know, the new animal crossing game for the switch comes out at midnight tonight (in the US EST, at least! :P). I've been super super looking forward to it.
I've had to recently start administering nightly mesalamine enemas as per my doctor's orders to cure my current flare-up. I've only done a few so far and they've all been pretty uncomfortable, upsetting experiences. I take a while going through the whole process, typically to the point where the whole ordeal would take around 2 hours.
However, I've been so excited for the switch release for animal crossing, I knew that I wanted to complete my enema in time so that I could play it comfortably in bed (I do my enemas in the bathroom, always felt safer idk). As of right now I got that sucker done, QUICK. That stupid bottle went right up there, squeezed that bottle dry in seconds, and now I'm happily waiting my 30 mins till I can get into bed in time for release :)
Being diagnosed with UC recently and stuck dealing with it completely alone for the past few weeks due to the coronavirus, animal crossing is exactly what I need to get my mind off of things. I hope any other possible AC players here are just as excited as I am!",2020-03-20 04:33:47

I just received a call from my doctor informing me that there is now data to suggest that patients on Xeljanz are not recovering well from coronavirus infections.

I realize I've never posted here before so I guess I should give a brief summary of my situation. I'm 22 and was diagnosed with UC a little over 3 years ago. Since then I've tried mesalamine, Humira, and Entivyo, and have failed all 3; Prednisone is the only medication that keeps me out of a flare and so I've been taking that every day for a couple years now. I hate being on steroids (they affect my mood a lot) and so I am always trying to come off of them, but every time I do I end up in the hospital with a bad flare (been hospitalized 4 times in the past 2 years). I was strongly considering surgery this spring since I'm starting a grad school program in the fall that requires a lot of traveling and for which I want to be healthy, but with the pandemic underway that's no longer an option. So that's why I'm trying to decide between these 2 medications right now.

I'm so tired cause i cant sleep and  honestly as much as i hate the side affects of prednisone i almost want to be on the higher dose just so i don't feel this stomach pain anymore. And honestly the bathroom breaks are getting rediculous again, thankfully theres no blood and its all still solid but 4-7 poos is getting tiring. I am in contact with my GI btw and will update him in the morning that the pain is getting worse but i also know that what he can do for me is really limited cause of a combo of state lines and insurance being wacky. Just if anyone has any tips that isn't sleeping all day and hoping that it'll go away after fitful 2 hour naps that'd be great.",2020-03-23 07:54:56

I am a compulsive overeater and a teacher told me that in order for me not to want to overeat anymore i should should understand the consequences of poor diet. One consequence, as i've understood it, is the development of ulcerative colitis.   


I think it's important for me to hear from those who have ulcerative colitis about what life is like with it, if that is okay. You would be doing me a great service if I could hear from you personally about your struggles as it would help me with my overeating as, if i know what it will bring, i won't want to overeat anymore

It has never been so bad to be hospitalized but it has been relentless with urgent and frequent \~10 bathroom trips every day. Never experienced any sort of remission before besides a couple of single good days. Multiple medications ineffective. Latest flex sigmoidoscopy showed still inflamed, and might have to start considering surgery as an option. I know a little about the options, (J-Pouch and Illeostomy) and am leaning towards illeostomy just to have less risk of infection.

&#x200B;

For a perspective where I am in life, I'm 24M, graduated college last year and am still trying to find my footing into a career. Not the most socially active, I mostly play video games with online friends as my main hobby, I enjoy being active but just am not because of my condition. I don't have a ton of family and am open to moving anywhere I can get a job.

&#x200B;

I'll be speaking to my doctor in the next week or two about my results and options moving forward, but yeah It's looking like surgery. Can anyone give me some insight or comfort on going down this route? How is life after an ostomy bag? I hear its nearly unchanged and you are free to do any normal daily activities you could do before having UC. But what about things like swimming, laying on your stomach, even wearing a seat belt...some trivial stuff that just seem like it would get in the way. I'd hate to make a permanent decision like this only to realize after the fact that XYZ things are big no-no's now.

3204,Just venting,DavidTheBarbarian,5,fonrqo,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/fonrqo/just_venting/,2,"So, after a year of the most perfect remission i've ever experienced in 15 years with this disease thanks to 5mg twice a day or Xeljanz,  I started flaring about 2 weeks ago.  My stools are still solid, but theres a-lot of blood, mucus and urgency because of that, so i suspect that most of my issue is mostly proctitis and likely not inflammation further up the pipe.

Im not sure what changed,  I moved into a new house in January, so suspect a possible environmental change that could have triggered it,  or it could be stress considering everything going on.   The Xeljanz was working perfectly for a year, so having a hard time believing it just 'stopped working'.  Ive read a lot to indicate that doesn't normally happen because its interaction is so short that the body rarely builds a resistance towards it.

Anyhow,  my current issue is just availability.  My primary GI office is nowhere to be found (they're not even returning phone calls right now so I imagine they just shut down and the phone isn't even going to voice mail),  and I'm in the wait state to get into a new practice.  Had to resort to my primary care provider to give me a referral to a new clinic,  so waiting for them to process me and get an appointment scheduled, which could be weeks from now.

Short term,  I have a little prednisone.  20mg of pred helps me immensely,  but i need it twice a day,  and i only have enough to last for a couple of weeks taking it once a day.  Today Im going to go down the road of trying to see if I can get my primary care provider to give me a month script for 40/80mg of prednisone a day, and hope the new GI once I get to them can help pull me out of this flare.  It really couldn't have happened at a worse time

The Xeljanz had been working so well I'd almost forgotten I had UC,  and the last year of not struggling with it has been glorious!

Debating what non medical options i can try now to help get this flare under control.  Have been trying to eat low residue to cut back on the number of bowel movements, though when i do go its typically mucous and blood as opposed to waste material.  As i mentioned, theyre still mostly decently formed still so i'm absorbing water well

Just wanted to complain.  With the state of the world at the moment,  really reminds me how bad this disease can be and how dependent i am on medications that can sometimes be such a pain to get ahold of in this country.    I do know however that an ER is always an option,   but im not at that level of desperate yet,  and im not wanting to clog the medical system right now any further with everything going on with COVID so im trying my best to deal with this from home for the time being

I'm worried about blood clots. For those that may not know, Xeljanz has a black box warning for blood clots. My legs don't look swollen, but my calves have been hurting a little bit at night. My ankles may be slightly swollen but I might be psyching myself out. 

I'm calling my GI first thing in the morning. Before I went on Xeljanz (started Oct 2019 right out of the hospital), the doctor discussed the risk at length with me. He said one of his patients needed blood thinners.

I've got what my dr called ""stable anemia"". The iron gluconate capsules I've been taking(1x a day usually though i need to take it 2x a day, I'm emetophobic and scared to take 2 at one time for worry of stomach upset) haven't done a thing to raise my RBC or iron levels it seems.

I got a slow releasing iron to try but idk if it will make a difference. It was highly recommended but I'm sceptical still.

I don't know if I just suck at absorbing things or what. My colitis is not currently flaring but I have a chronic sore spot in the right lower side of my intestine, which my 20lb cat LOVEs to stand on :') 

Does anyone have a brand or type of iron they find easy on the insides and effective? If the slow release doesn't work for me after I finish off these gluconate capsules i might fork out the money for liquid iron and mix it with a high vit C fruit juice or something. 

I'm just so frustrated with my body not doing anything right lately :^) 

I'm female to male transgender and haven't had a period in a couple months but the last few I had were heavy and I'm sure that set me back a bit.

I call the office again during the last week and no one's been picking up. I have no choice but to go to the ER to see a specialist.  

Some blood tests and 24 hours later with no treatment at all, my GI sends me home with 40mg prednisone, calcium, and iron. Saw some improvement on the first few days of prednisone (no blood in the water, just bloody mucus, and poop that's less diarrhea-like), slight improvement in appetite, but lost some sense of taste. Except yesterday all my symptoms came back to maybe 85% as bad as it was before the prednisone, just BMs are not as painful. This is the first time I use prednisone on its own. The last two times I was on 60mg of solumedrol (steroid) by iv at the hospital and they only gave me prednisone to taper when I was discharged when I was feeling much better.  
Edit: also losing some sense of taste is a new side effect from the prednisone this time... And last night, for the very first time, I lost control of my bowels in my sleep. It wasn't blood or poop, but my butt was wet this morning (or I somehow managed to pee myself without getting the from of my underwear wet idk).

As for my Infliximab, the dose 10 weeks ago, I told the nurse that I started getting some mucus, so she told me that I might need to increase my dosage. It's at 5mg/kg, so I get 200mg every visit (6 weeks) and I was roughly 54/55kg. The GI changed my schedule to every 4 weeks instead of increasing my dose.  
Four weeks ago, I had my first dose with active bleeding (this is the visit where they drew my blood for the Infliximab dosage). I got my infusion with 100mg of hydrocortisone. The next day was the only day that I felt much better.  

I just feel that nothing is helping me right now and it feels like my doctor isn't doing much. I don't want to go back to the hospital again especially if it turns out to be a waste of time. What am I supposed to do? Wait until I faint from blood loss or until my body can't keep any food down?",2020-03-28 18:59:45

My boyfriend (23m) has UC. He started having symptoms around October, got really bad November, hospitalized for a about a week in December. There was a bunch of problems with insurance and what not so he hasn’t been able to get a refill for his medication for about a month (?). He has lost about 30-40 pounds and is just in a constant state of misery. He went from being provider of the home to staying in bed most of the day and night while I have been working full time to support us. I love him and have no problem taking care of him but this is a first for the both of us. I’m constantly researching and trying to find different diets and things to help provide him relief which he refuses to listen to or try majority of the time. He was telling me last night that he feels super depressed Bc he can’t do anything for me and how his life was completely normal months ago and now he feels like he can’t do anything, not even work. 
I don’t know what to do anymore bc I don’t know what it’s like to be on his end of things and to go through what he is experiencing right now. I feel an immense pressure to help him Bc he constantly reminds me that I am all he has. His family and friends have pretty much all disappeared and those who have stuck around don’t understand the severity of his situation.
I love this man and I want him to be happy and healthy but I don’t know what to do.

Any advice is appreciated, sorry if it seems like I’m ranting but we’re kind of alone in this situation and this group is the only thing I can think of that might helps


Edit: by diets I mostly mean just suggesting a variety of snacks and meals he could try, or substitutions for things etc.,

Sometimes he just will not eat bc “if there’s nothing in his stomach, there won’t be anything to shit out”",2020-03-28 17:11:54

Taking 4.8g mes and enemas, didn't really seem to help a ton so did a short course of pred in Jan that didn't really do much either.  Before escalating more medication the GI wanted to do a flex-sig so we did one a few weeks ago and great news, basically in full remission.  He said if I had come in without symptoms he wouldn't have even thought UC.  Also took some biopsies that showed no inflammation and there was something in the rectum that showed prior inflammation.  He thought any symptoms I had were thus IBS.

So that's def great news, I feel lucky.  Yet for the past few weeks still have annoying stomach symptoms that started in Nov (right before diagnosis) and haven't abated.  Does anyone have the commingling IBS with IBD in remission?  Main symptoms are bloating and mild pain.  I know diet can help, any OTC medication to try?  Nothing really seems to trigger it either.

In February I got inflammation of the middle ear and used some antibiotics on it and from that days I started vomiting.. A lot of vomiting, like everything I eat or even drink. To this day I only know, that I can't drink sparkled water (triggers vomiting). Sometimes I can eat anything and I'm still okay, but sometimes even dry rice or mashed potatos makes me vomit. Doc told me that this is really weird, he sent me for colonoscopy and endoscopy. I was told that my colonoscopy is even worse than ever before (even though my colon problems got better). Endoscopy found nothing... So they changed my biologic treatment to Humira (which should take effect after 4 - 5 dose of injection, I get 1 every two weeks). Even my doc desn't know what to do with me.

Important, I have mild UC and mild psoriasis, I manage this by smoking, because Asacol didn't work for me, and I couldn't be put on other medications at the time of my initial flare-up because of interactions.

I have a friend who has IBD with very similar issues as me, I'll get back to my friend later.

So, about three weeks ago, I got the most INTENSE flare-up I've ever had, out of nowhere, it was like going into the peak of a bad flare-up, but in 3-4 hours, and I never get them anymore.  
I started wondering what caused it, maybe it was reducing my smoking because of fear of pneumonia due to COVID-19, but it takes roughly 2-3 months after I quite smoking for me to get a flare up?  
Then, I got a headache, chills that would come and go, almost a fever, and runny nose.

We had been told we had no community spread in Sweden where I live, when I was about 6 days into this, so I just thought I had a weird cold/influenza type thing.  
Well, at day 7, I got this really scary pressure and pain in my chest, and a bad cough.  
Day 9 I felt a lot better, cough was clearing up  
Day 12 I felt good enough to try to take a walk, not touch anything, and keep a distance, I had been self-isolating for 12 days at this point, with no human contact. I could only walk 20 meters without stopping to catch my breath.

A few days later and my breathing returned to normal.

Skip ahead to a couple of days ago, I talked with a friend who has IBD, who had an extremely similar experience, very light symptoms (she didn't have a cough), it went away much faster for her and it was much lighter. Importantly, she had a very rough initial IBD flare up preceded the rest of the symptoms.

Sorry in advance if this is the wrong place to post this!

I'm looking for some insight on whether it would be wise to get a doctor's note saying I can't come to work for at least 1-2 weeks due to the virus. Here's why - I've been on aziathoprine (Imuran) for the last 4-5 years, with prednisone in small spurts when a strong flare would arise although it's been at least a year since I've been on the pred. 

Unfortunately since I work in security, we are considered ""essential"", at least here in the U.S. The type of security I do is basically like airport security, scanning people with a handwand and running luggage through an x-ray, that type of thing. So it is literally impossible for me to stay at least 6 feet away from people for as long as I'm at work; I basically have to trust that they are maintaining good hygiene and generally taking this seriously which I hate cause a lot of people sadly aren't. 

I'm in my early 20s and aside from UC generally pretty healthy, so according to the chart in this sub I'm at ""moderate risk"". Maybe I'm just being paranoid about all this, but living here in the good ol' U S of A I'd rather not risk the thousands of dollars in medical bills if I did happen to contract the virus.",2020-03-30 17:22:14

I was put on mesalamine and prednisone after my colonoscopy, and the bleeding (mostly) stopped after 6 or so weeks.

I suddenly dropped to 1 or less bowel movements everyday, and had no diarrhea.  In fact I was constipated all the time, and often unloaded absolute monster sized craps, occasionally with chunks of undigested food and medicine tablets.  I thought you were in remission when the bleeding stopped, but I’m not sure if that’s really the case.

The pain was still intense and I would randomly shake and have to lay down.  Still sleeping 16 hours a day.  I was unable to go to work even though the bleeding and urgency had stopped a month or more back.  My doctor has written multiple work notes, medical leave forms, and is still excusing me for the time being.

I honestly feel incredibly guilty as I’ve had to receive lots of financial help from my family, friends, and church.  I tried multiple times to go back to work, and each time I ended up shaking, keeled over, and holding my stomach in pain.  I’ve never been in a position where I’ve had to miss more than a few days for an illness before.  I feel like the laziest person on earth.

About a week ago, shortly after my first Inflectra infusion, I’ve noticed a noticeable drop in the pain I feel.   I suddenly feel pretty good, and just have the occasional pressurized feeling during the first half of the day.  It tends to get worse at night, but I feel good enough now that I’ve almost convinced myself the last few months was all in my head, or I was somehow exaggerating how I felt.  My wife has to keep reminding me that I’m not actually a lazy pos, and that what I have is real.

Anyways, here’s my questions

1. How do you know if you’re in remission?  Is it when the bleeding and urgency go away, or is there more to it?

2. Will I still experience pain while in remission?  The pressure type pain, the intense pain if I get poked, walk too much, or have a bowel movement?

(once my 4 year old daughter hit me with her tiny strength and it actually was enough to cause hours of extreme pain)

3. Is it normal to miss months of work during flare ups?  Many of you seem to be managing working just fine, so I’m wondering if I’m handling things incorrectly.

4. Will future flare ups be easier to manage since we mostly know what’s going on now?  I had symptoms for a month before I even got looked at, thinking it was a bad flu or something.

Thanks in advance guys!",2019-12-01 20:45:31

After UC diagnosis, I was prescribed mesalazine, but I don't see anything that helps.

I am dehydrated all the time, I have a bowel movement 5-10 times a day, sometimes I have to get up in the middle of the night, besides I have terrible anemia, I feel tired all the time.

I’m so happy I found this group and reading everyones posts have relieved a lot of anxiety. I just have general questions about how you guys handle everything. Some background:
I am a 22y F (Canada) and got diagnosed around a year ago. Since February, I have had 3 scopes done. 1 endoscopy, 1 colonoscopy, and 1 emergency sigmoidoscopy. In June I began taking Mezavant, and my symptoms would come and go in waves. My stool has been persistently bloody, but changes from solid to diarrhea. A lot of the time when I have the strong urge, I go, and its just liquid and blood. I started taking Mezavant in enema form (Pentasa) in September, but after a month started having severe diarrhea and cramping with each BM. This is when I had the emergency scope done, ny case was labeled as severe, and stopped taking the enemas. In October I started taking Cortiment, a slow release steroid. I feel like this isn’t really working, so I saw my GI again in early November. I was told that if they weren’t working I’d be in a lot more pain, but I’m now realizing they were from the enemas. I know this because she represcribed them, and after a week I was in an UNBEARABLE amount of pain. Cramping, the urge to puke, and just so much pain. So here I am now, only on cortiment and no enemas. I am constantly constipated, and if I do go it is very loose stool, bloody, very watery and painful. 

So my questions for you are:
Does anyone feel regular hunger? I want to eat less to give my gut a break but I’m just so hungry despite the pain. 
Are there any obvious foods I should be avoiding? When its really bad I try to eat bland foods. 
Does anyone go through a long period of constipation, and then it seems like one random day you’re on the toilet ALL day long with intense BMs?
As a woman, I feel like my doctor doesn’t take me as seriously as she would a man. How do I get my symptoms across so that I am taken seriously? People keep saying its just a flare up. But its not a flare up, its never healed. 

I am so worn down emotionally and physically and have run out of things to try and do. I feel as though its taken over my life and I don’t know how to deal!!",2019-12-02 02:52:15

He seemed very uncomfortable telling me, but also a sense of relief.

I love him. I want to have a future with him. I see myself marrying him and having children with him. Finding this out did not change that. I still feel the same way... I just want to know more. I’m sure we will communicate more about this as time goes on, but I am just very concerned, confused, and worried right now. He told me that he feels fine, he is not in pain... but said that most people with UC get screened for cancer every 3 years, and that he gets screened once a year. He said that his doctor says that he has a high chance of developing cancer since he’s had UC for so long. I tried to hide my fear from him.

I mention the pain to my GI and showed him the locations and he said it shouldn’t have to do with UC or Crohns. Its pretty much started at the peak of my flare this last month. Blood, diarrhea, loss of weight, really bad chest cold. I’ve been getting my other symptoms under control but my back pain seems to come back in waves and gets worse every week.

It feels like something is poking my muscles around my ribs when I take a deep breath. Zero pain standing still but at the peak of my inhale it feels like something is catching or poking, really intense sharp pain. Back just feels really tight.

This is where it gets weird. Sometimes when I take a quick deep deep breath it feels like something around my ribs shifts and although pretty painful at first it releases pressure and I can take a full breath without pain. Like something re arranged. I can feel something slide. So for about the next couple days I’ll be fine and can breath with minor pain.

But when I lay down or go to sleep my pain will come back. And I’ll wake up back to square one with sharp pain as the peak of a breath or even when I lean too far to one side. 

This has been going on for a month, feels almost great one day but the next will be in pain again. And the sliding of the “muscles” has only happened a few times but eveytime it helps me breath. 

I’m getting more tests done hopefully this week. 

Has anyone dealt with this?
I’m hoping it’s not a IBD thing and I just have a bruised rib from my extreme weight loss and chest cold, but the pain seems to match mu bms. What I mean by that is when I have a bad bm my back is usually in a lot of pain. But I’ve also had some bad bm when my back feels fine so idk.

Anyways thanks for the long read",2019-12-05 05:54:11

Scope in September showed patch of inflammation on left side so changed to left sided colitis. Fast forward to start of October a flare started and it wouldn't shift.   Ended up having bad pain and was in hospital a week mid November.  Put on IV steroids that seemed to help but wasn't normal.  Sent away on 40mg pred on a 8 week taper.  

The bleeding stopped and I wasn't going all day but urgency and more bowel movements came back late at night into morning, assumed steroid wearing off.  Tapered down and currently on 30mg but currently constantly having watery stools but didnt feel 'clear'. 15 times a day but only blood occasionally.  High up stomach pain right at belly button like full of gas. IBD nurse advised to go to hospital as clearly not responding to steroids and the mesalamine oral and rectal is doing nowt and actually have always felt I'm reacting to the meds.  Got bloods done and they always come back more or less normal.  Cpr not raised and white blood cell only slightly up but they said that maybe was the steroids.  Potassium a bit low I assume from constantly shitting water!  Stool tests all say negative for infection. They did an abdominal xray and said it looks there is mild impaction on the left side which can ironically cause.. Watery stools and want me to take a laxitive sachet thing to try clear it?? Said the normal enema they use can't be used with people with UC. The xray didn't show any other major inflammation or swelling.  My GI is stumped as to why all my levels always seem normal but I'm having such bad symptoms.  Planned a scope next Friday to examine further and possibly a MRI of small bowel.  They are now starting to talk about biologics depending what they find.  

This seems crazy as I responded so quick to mesalamine the first time but now I haven't even responded to pred first time.  All happening quicker than expected.  Does anyone have experience with a blockage of sorts?",2019-12-06 20:36:25

I received my first colonoscopy and they prescribed me lialda. I took it for about a month or so. .

Since, I have had no symptoms of this disease (diarrhea, frequency of going, blood, joint pain) that I can tell. And which I am thankful. 

I recently had another colonoscopy, no symptoms that prompted it, I just thought it would be good to follow up from the diagnoses I received 10 years ago.  

They again saw inflammation in the rectum and left side of my colon. And the doctor wants me to start taking a daily Pill to help with inflammation. 

After reading stories on this thread, I feel very fortunate that I have not had to go through what most people have had to go though with this disease. 

My questions:
Has anyone heard of or seen a similar scenario with UC? And if so, in your experience, is this a disease that gets progressively worse over time? 

I have read that the pill is used to reduce inflammation and help with symptoms. However, long term studies havent shown that meds have reduced the likelihood of cancer. 

I worry about side effects with medication but because I don’t have traditional symptoms I’m not sure if daily medication is the best path? 

Again, I know this probably comes across as pretentious because I have not had to deal with what most people are dealing with but I’m really not sure what to do.

My first one, the one that helped actually diagnose me, was really traumatic- since I was only 14, I was scared and anxious already, in a lot of pain, etc. Despite my huge fear of needles and IVs, I don’t fight, just cry and need my hand held usually. That first time though, I remember being held down by a team of nurses while they put the IV in but because they couldn’t get a good stick, they tried 5 different times, all while I was crying and terrified, and then everything went black. Since then, everything about the procedure makes me upset and anxious, almost angry. Aside from the prep being obnoxious, everything sets me off. Obviously the IV is still a huge source of anxiety, actually being put under is terrifying, I hate the idea of people seeing me and handling me while I’m unconscious, especially in such a private/intimate area... just typing this all out has me panicking and crying in my car.

Just wanted to say that after struggling a lot with UC, meds not working, trying to find new hobbies, new group of friends, new passions, learning healthy habits, i kind of gave up.

But, a few weeks ago i realized that my problem was in my mental health. It's hard to know if you are healthy or nuts when the only thing you have experienced is reality as you, and we as humans can't really share experiences, just interpretations of them.

So now that i know that, i started taking antidepressants, and within three weeks i finally got into remission after a really though year.

Just wanted to share my experience, not trying to tell anybody that this is the solution, but just a heads up and to take care of your mental health as it plays a huge role in life. Dont give up, a solution will appear, just keep on fighting and we are together in this. 

We can do this! Am still not even near to happy, really really depressed but when hope of getting better leaves you, and after some time it comes back, it comes back with a lot more power. Things will get better. A big hug to everyone <3",2019-12-10 16:27:15

I’ve found the enema and rectal version are pretty good making my symptoms better, but when I take the sachets I feel some discomfort at the time they get to my colon and I have to stay in the toilette until they are out.

Mine is mild with just the lower colon and rectum being affected. Symptoms started with mucus for 3 months until I took the retal mesalazine with some MMX technology to get released and It got worse with pain and bleeding. Not sure if it was the medicine or it was just a coincidence. 

Now I’ve been treating it with only Pentasa (oral+rectal) and it seems to be getting better, but since those sachets (granules) are very expensive I want to know if any of you have experienced something similar? I’m also afraid that if I don’t take the oral version the inflammation could go up or increase suddenly.

First biologic + 3 different meds at the same time is right now keeping me functioning (but I am still flaring), but the last 3 weeks I spent in hospital I was told by surgeons that my entire colon is affected and I will need surgery eventually. 

They want me to consider doing surgery soon as a semi-elective so I can wean off my steroids and do it when I’m ‘healthy’ for a better recovery. 

I thought about pushing for other biologics and holding out for trials, but I don’t know if I want to risk having these flares every few months that completely take my life away from me. I’m currently seeing a psychiatrist and dealing with so many mental issues just from the illness and my hospital experience, as I’m sure you can all relate to. I will not mentally be able to cope with bi-monthly hospital stays for life. 

I think I want to have the surgery but I feel like I’ll be judged for giving up, especially being so young and newly diagnosed (although the year feels like an eternity to me). So many people here say that they were close to surgery and found a med that worked for them, but I want to have a tiny bit of control over when this affects my life.

So I’ve had UC since I was 7/8 (probably had it before that but that’s when they diagnosed me). I’m 27 in Feb and I want to do something I’ve never tried before to help me, I want to become Vegetarian. 

Over the last few weeks, me and my wife have been eating less and less meat and I’ve felt better in myself. This week for instance I’ve eaten vegetarian meals for 4/5 nights and then leftovers for some of those meals the following day at lunch and I’ve felt so much better (I gave into having a lamb Bhuna 😔).

I’m going to make a New Years resolution for the first time in 2020 to completely give up meat to see if it helps.

Just want to know if someone in here is VEGAN and how this change in your food makes you fill.

I have my upside-downs with UC like all of us ( i suppose).

But when it cames to food  I really dont know whats happening down there. Because  when I eat pizza (only from a place i know ""almost homemade"")  it doesn't make me fill bloated and the next day i go to the bathroom and everything´s OK. But when i try to eat even more  healthier without processed food i star bleeding a little bit just at the end when i poop, sometimes i don´t even notice so i look to the toilet to see the blood. And before eating healthier i just to bleed a little bit sometimes.

Monday was my first Vegan day and everything was OK I even poop a lot an without blood.

Yesterday I eat the same as on Monday but today i started bleeding (a little bit) I HATE THAT because i try hard REALLY HARD to eat healthier but still i can get my body in remission. 

I´m trying to BULK in the GYM and i don´t know if changing my lifestyle to VEGANISM is the right way.

Anyone here try veganism? its better to eat chicken and eggs without red meat?  i used to eat egg whites and chicken as protein some time fresh cheese, and a lot of veggies and clean carbs. But some times i bleed and sometimes i don´t, i really don´t know what to do. I take my medicine MESALAZINE

Chick fil A chicken noodle soup (its super salty too and helps with my electrolytes) they use grilled chicken in it and the veggies and noodles are very well cooked and its quick and yummy!

Miso soup: this one actually makes me feel BETTER! I have a big bowl of it once a day an for some reason my cramping subsides. Again its also quite salty and good for recovering after too many loose stools

WATER. so. Much. Water. I pee so often dear god when will it end

Light sandwiches on white bread by light I mean 2 slices of high quality turkey, 1 slice of swiss cheese, some spinach and a little bit of mayo, hasnt effected me negatively at all but I think its because its so low residue

White rice and stir fried chicken with a bit of soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic stir fried in sesame seed oil

And baked chicken lightly seasoned and baked in chicken broth usually over white rice

Its a lot of chicken haha and Ive also been eating incredibly small portions basically every 2 or 3 hours. This has kept me only running to the bathroom 3 or 4 times a day without too much cramping which is wonderful for me considering how painful this flare was when it started.

I’ve been told to do a blood test which they are just sending out and they will check the drug level in my blood before they can change my medicine and the care team will talk with the consultant whether I should be put on a course of steroids.

About a year ago (January 3rd) I was diagnosed with a mild form of UC found just in the rectum. Since then I have been taking oral mesalamine four times a day and things have cleared up. I’m a male and currently 22 years old.

In the past few months I have had minor abdominal pain here and there, but no symptoms found inside the bowl. Before I was diagnosed I didn’t have any abdominal pain, just mucus and blood.

On Monday, though, I saw some mucus and a faint streak of blood on part of my stool. Since then I have seen mucus on two other occasions. I usually have two to three bowel movements a day. I am set for a follow-up colonoscopy on December 30th, but I am just terrified about what this holds for the future. I would be content with just being on mesalamine for eternity, but I know that might not be possible.

Overall, I think what scares me most is the possibility of having to jump from medicine to medicine and possibly having my colon need to be removed. My uncle had colon cancer and eventually had to get his colon removed. Seeing how he suffered, I’m not sure I would ever want to go that route, even with things like the j-pouch.",2019-12-19 20:22:33

when any of you guys were diagnosed, was there inflammation anywhere in your GI track besides your colon?

Basically the way my GI explained it was that it was crohns disease heavily focused in the colon and really having no effect anywhere else... so he classifies me as a UC patient and it says UC on my medical records with no mention of crohns or ""crohns colitis"".

I've been wanting to know if ""crohns colitis"" is actually a thing, or if I should just have a crohns diagnosis, or if some inflammation outside the colon is just normal for UC patients.

3470,Do you guys wish that your GIs cared more about the mental aspect of UC?,salmonellapoison,77,ect8u9,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ect8u9/do_you_guys_wish_that_your_gis_cared_more_about/,19,"Title. My GI seems to not really care about the mental aspect of a chronic disease and more about just shoving more medication down my throat. I’m 13 years old with very severe UC (my old GI said it was one of the worst cases she’s seen in my age. Old GI moved away :/.)
I’m in therapy right now, which has been helpful. But that all gets undone once my GI tells me all the bad things that will happen to me without taking my medication properly. Which I am FULLY aware of and have been trying my best with the stress I’m going through.

My childhood has been thrown out the window because of this damned disease. Missing 5 months of school from a flare, seemingly never-ending treatments, and the fact that some of my symptoms can be attributed to OTHER things and not just my disease.

Like the fatigue could be from iron deficiency. Or from my insomnia, or my depression, or MAYBE it’s the steroids I’m on.

The cramping could be my disease, sure. Or maybe it’s just my menstrual cycle, or anxiety. 

Not every single one of my symptoms are due to this disease. They have real world parallels that have nothing to DO with my disease.

This disease sucks. And I hate dealing with it everyday. It’s the same spiel to my mother too. Because to her it’s just taking medication and moving on. Which is SO far from the truth. It’s an everyday battle with myself to keep going with this disease and to others it’s just a disease. Just a new diet. Just wearing a mask for my weak immune system. Just a disease, nothing more to it.

Sorry for the rant. I know I should be taking medications as prescribed and I am trying my best to do so. I have a GI appointment + I’m sick with a fever so sorry if all of that is just fever ridden gibberish ( + it’s 5:32am and I can’t sleep.)",2019-12-19 14:33:24

I was perscribed the steroid prednisone and it got rid of all my symptoms very quickly then I became allergic to it and broke out with crazy amount of acne on my face and that was pretty terrible almost felt worse than the colitis at the moment because i felt like i had to explain it and the colitis was easier to hide. But then i switched to budesonide to taper off from the steroids and began entyvio infusions. I was symptom free except for when I would drink (especially liquor) I might see a little blood the following day. Then I missed my entyvio appointment and forgot to reschedule for a while, then I had to take antibiotics for a different reason and drank the weekend after, and it was finals week so I was stressed and sleeping bad and eating bad and I flared up again big time. So now I’m back on steroids to try to settle it before my next infusion on January 2nd. Gist of the story don’t get lazy with your medication this is fucking up my whole month.

So I have been on prednisone since early September. I was started on 40mg and I have also had two rounds of IV methopred. After all that hell I was finally allowed to taper off a month ago ( I was on high dose prednisone for so long because I just kept having issues and My symptoms were super super persisitant I guess you could say) I am now on 20mg and so far things aren’t getting worse so I guess that’s good. Now the side effects of prednisone are actually awful. My face has blown up so much and I have gained probably close to 25 pounds from my lowest weight ( during all this I did lose about 12 pounds so I needed to gain some of it back)and my clothes don’t fit. Also I have some pretty intense acne. So I guess my question is how long does it take for the moonface and weight to come off ? I know that it will come off eventually but is it something I will notice pretty quickly when coming off the pred or will it take a while longer  because I have been on it for so long. I am grateful for the prednisone I guess, I was pretty severe when I was diagnosed and the prednisone has helped me feel better but the side effects of it suck and I just feel so insecure about everything. I am already trying to cope with the fact that I have a shitty disease (quite literally) and I have a had really rough go with it so far. I have been on so many meds and so many of them have failed so that also hard to deal with and then on top of all this bull crap I have to deal with the fact that my face is super puffy and bloated and it’s making me really,really self conscious to the point where I have to Try and avoid mirrors because looking at my face and body currently makes me super upset.anyways if any of you have experience with this please help a girl out lol.",2019-12-20 05:02:16

I've been reading posts in this group for about 6 months now. Just wanted to share one of my recent experiences

I was diagnosed with UC about 10 years ago. Currently on Pentasa, immuran and 4mg of Prednisone. Have been in a flare for the last 2,5 months.

Apart from that I take probiotics, tumeric and omega -3 supplements regularly. Work a particularly stressful job which has me traveling once every two/three weeks. 

Recently I started taking tumeric with piperine (derived from black pepper) when I couldn't find tumeric in the stores. Needless to say, it has helped my current flair tremendously. Went from bloody loose stools to no blood and somewhat solid stools in a day.

Apparently piperine helps the absorption of tumeric by quite some bit. Just thought I would share this.

It is worse in the morning. No other symptoms so I don’t think it’s some sort of other illness. My UC is currently mostly controlled. I’m taking balsalazide (colozal) which I switched to about a month ago because under my high deductible plan I cannot afford mesalamine which worked well for me (f**k US healthcare right?). Could it be a side effect of the medicine or just a symptom of UC that I haven’t experienced before? If so, any tips on managing it? I am an active person so this is very frustrating to me. Any responses are appreciated! And for the record, I will be making an appointment with my GI doc but I’m sure I won’t get in for a few weeks.",2019-12-24 17:09:58

A little back story. Im 24 and I was diagnosed with UC two years ago, since then i really never went into remission until last month which required an emergency room visit and a change of meds. Which finally put me in remission.

I have always dealt with my UC as privately as possible. My mom on the other hand told my whole family and close friends as time went on. Im not mad at that, my family is very close and I love them all to death. What does bother me is everyone reads one article and believes they have the best solution for me. A tea, some diet or a combination of both. I know they are just trying to care for me and I appreciate it but its became the something that I hear about from at least one family member at every party, phone call ect. Im sure I'll hear it at least twice tonight for xmas eve. 


Anyways im just wondering if anyone else has this happen to them and  if I am crazy for wanting to go to a family party and just not have it  brought up at all.

Edit: Thanks for all the support everyone! Hope everyone enjoys the holidays!",2019-12-24 15:49:29

I was diagnosed with moderate UC in June of 2018. I have been in a 8ish month flare thats been pretty shitty. Basically in the bathroom 30 times a day. Started humira 40mg a week about 4-5 months ago. Im also on prednisone 30mg and mesalamine oral and suppositories. Im still in a pretty bad way and haven’t stopped bleeding since June 2019 even with all the drugs.

My question for you all is around the humira. I have a pretty high blood serum concentration (12 mcg/ml) and no antibodies but I’m still super symptomatic.  Have any of you gone higher than 40mg/week? Might it be time to move to another biologic? My GI had floated the idea of adding 6mp in the next weeks but I’m not sure which route i want to go.

Anyway, thanks for any replies and I hope your poops are doing better than mine :p",2019-12-26 19:11:56

After dinner we went to see Star Wars.  It was the fam plus two grandmas.  

About 1 hour 20 minutes in, I decide to head to the bathroom.  I probably could have held on longer, but didn't want to risk it.  I was gone maybe 10 minutes if even that.   I decided to be courteous and sit down front upon my return so that I didn't have to crawl over the really tall guy that decided to sit in our row and to make a quick getaway in case I had to go again.  This seat was in the third row which had its back to the front aisle and the rest of the seats.

About 20 minutes later husband texts me asking where I am and if I'm ok.  I told him my location and he texts back that my mom and his mom have been in the bathroom, lobby and even out to the car looking for me.  Multiple times!  They're still out in the hall and I retrieve them.  My mom sits up front and G2 returns to the seat.

Thank you, but don't you think I would have texted saying that I have a problem?

After I got better it all came back and I grew 2 inches but I never really got that “crazy teenage hormones omg I’m gonna date people” stuff. My mom thinks it’s cause all my stuff happened in the middle of puberty so my body had other priorities but idk. Did any of you guys have this go on cause it’s affected having a relationship cause even now at 20 I don’t see the point of having a real physical relationship which is weird for some people.

3549,So I figured I should tell my story,SlothHammer_,7,egeh7r,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/egeh7r/so_i_figured_i_should_tell_my_story/,15,"Hello everyone! I was recently diagnosed with moderate Pancolitis in October 2019 at 24 years old. It is difficult to say when my initial flair started but I have had digestive issues on and off for I would say around 5/6 years such as gas, bloating, cramping, piles and diarrhea intermittently, never enough to greatly effect my life. This all changed however roughly 6 months before diagnosis, I was a Brit living in Canada and was about to travel across the USA for a month with my girlfriend. The stress of this trip I think really kicked it off as I realised every time I went to the bathroom I had loose stools. The strange thing is for me is I had very little urgency, I only went to the bathroom once or twice a day throughout this 6 month period, however everytime they were loose and many times were mucusy. I never noticed blood in my stool and there were only 1 or 2 occasions where I noticed a purple looking liquid which I think was undigested food and not actually blood so to this day I don't even know if I had bloody stools at all. By the end of this 6 month's I was beginning to lose weight, felt very unhealthy and had horrendous anxiety/depression as everything I ate caused havoc to my insides. I was very surprised when I was told it was UC. I started the SCD diet immediately and have been on Octasa (mesalamine) ever since and felt back to normal within a few weeks. This Christmas period however has thrown a spanner in the works as i think the amount I ate on xmas day has caused a small flare up. I have had diarrhoea for almost 48 hours so far, going 2/3 times a day. I have stripped my diet back and am having soup currently, hoping for a full recovery. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is what is my normal compared to someone else's? If i have diarrhoea does that mean i'm in a flare? I'm struggling to know and have become very obsessive over my stools etc. One thing I obsess over is my stomach pulsing, I feel like it does this when it is upset, does anyone else notice this when they place their hand on their stomach or just watch it pulsating up and down? Anyway, was wondering if anyone had any advice and if they maybe thought my case sounds mild? My doctor said the first flare is usually the worst so I'm hoping that will be true but I dont want to live my life in constant fear of losing my colon or worse dying from further health complications. Sorry if I sound dramatic! I am unfortunately a very anxious person. Wishing everyone a safe and happy christmas/New year and to healthy poops for all! Thanks",2019-12-27 19:04:52
3550,Awaiting Colonoscopy...Fun.,Sunfeet92,11,eg793u,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/eg793u/awaiting_colonoscopyfun/,17,"Hi there, posting for the first time. 

I haven’t been diagnosed yet, but am waiting for my colonoscopy on the 10th. Just have a few questions and am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. This is going to be a mini novel, so hang in there, haha. 

For the last however many years, several times a year I’ll have a couple weeks or so where I have an insane amount of gas. It is trapped and then builds up to the point where I can’t even stand straight. Gas-X and the like don’t ever seem to help. That’ll last a couple of days. I’ll have constipation during that time which of course doesn’t help the gas, ha. Once that ends, it’s diarrhea and loose stool for days. The very first time it happened to me, it seemed to last at least a month or so and I lost over 20lbs. Didn’t have any blood in my stool, but lots of mucus. This happens on and off every few months or so. Sometimes worse than others. I’ve really never sought a doctor for it because once it goes away, I feel relatively normal. 

 At the beginning of this month, I figured I ate something that didn’t agree with my stomach. The same deal as usual happened. About a week went by and I felt like I was in the clear, so I went about eating as usual. I thought I’d have a salad and beans for lunch one day. Later on, I ended up having intense stomach pains, and a burning feeling. I never felt ill, but ended up having diarrhea multiple times an hour for about 12 hours. This time was with pleeeeenty of blood, mucus and undigested food. Absolute worst that I’ve ever experienced. That scared me so I ended up getting in to see my primary care doctor the next morning. She sent me for labs and stool samples, and sent me up with a GI appointment. My stool sample had a lot of dark/black blood and fresh blood. Blood tests came back normal, stool samples came back negative for CDiff, parasites, etc but my calprotectin level came back elevated. I saw the GI, explained my symptoms, and that 90% of my every day BMs are loose with lots of mucus and very foul smelling. He obviously wants to wait until the colonoscopy before making any assumptions, but said this seems to not be IBS because of the blood, significant weight loss since the beginning of the month, and elevated calprotectin level. 

I’m a little nervous because I’m starting to feel better (happy, but of course it seems that my stomach can act up after feeling alright for several days in a row) and have heard some people take forever to get a diagnosis because their flare ends by the time they finally get in for a colonoscopy. Has this been a problem for anyone here? I’m so worried at the thought of going through the prep and colonoscopy only for them to not find anything—and then having to go through the whole cycle again. 

Anyway, just looking to see if what I consider to be my “flare ups” sound relatable to anyone else here. My symptoms seem very mild compared to most people with UC. I feel miserable when it acts up, so I really feel for anyone who suffers worse than I do. :( 

If you read all of this...thank you. You win. I know that was a lot. 😂 Thanks again for your help!!",2019-12-27 06:58:52
3551,Just diagnosed. Some questions.,,7,eg6b8i,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/eg6b8i/just_diagnosed_some_questions/,9,"So this week was a nightmare. Apparently I've had two flareups before when I was unaware what was going on, several years apart, that lasted only a week.This one has been ongoing for just over a month. I ignored it for so long that I ended up being hospitalized on the 18th and got out christmas eve, everything's a complete blur. I've never felt so much pain. I'm a skinny fucker and my gut was so swollen I looked like I had a massive beer gut, I couldn't get out of the hospital bed and make it to the bathroom without assistance for days. Never gone 6 days without any kind of solid food before.

So I was released with some antibiotics and a taper of prednisone, waiting until the 10th for a meeting with the doctor and results of some biopsies. I haven't spoken with him since before the colonoscopy. Is it normal to be released without further medication? I've read that it's common to be prescribed pills specifically to control this, I was hoping to avoid that considering the length of time between my previous flareups were 2-3 years.

Also trying to get a gauge on how much bleeding is ""acceptable"". It was gone when before I left the hospital, since I've come home it's back. Sometimes just a little bit, sometimes pretty bad looking. I figure as long as I'm not getting light headed and the swelling stays down, I should be good, right?

I'm still mostly chugging gatoraid and eating scrambled eggs, it's been weeks since I haven't had diarrhea. It sounds like this happens from time to time, it's hard to get a feel for what's normal and what isn't from just lurking on here though.",2019-12-27 05:28:56

I tested positive, and have since taken vanco and also read an awful lot about c diff.  It has near identical symptoms to a flare up, can get real bad quickly, and seems like I should've probably been tested for this during my initial flare up and second one.

Been getting massive knee pain flare ups these past few months and it’s the worst. (Have had UC diagnosis since summer 2013, and had my colon removed in March 2016. Final jpouch surgery was June 2018). I know I used to get knee pain as part of my flare pre-first surgery, but the feeling of it is very blurry since I was on so many meds and so sick when the majority of things went down. Since my first surgery, I’ve had some flares but usually presents more like fatigue and general achiness. However, these past few months of knee pain have been on a whole nother level. I’ve always had bad knees (flat footed, and did figure skating for 10 years) but then I was on and off presnisone from diagnosis until surgery, so I’m sure I have lasting impact from that.

As a 24 year old who wants to lead a relatively active lifestyle (I work in theatre and currently live in a very walking friendly city) this is just such a blow. I don’t know why I’m getting these flare ups, and they are just so painful. Idk if it could be related to my current BC (gonna be stopping for a bit after I finish this month’s pills to see), or if it’s UC related, past med related, or rheumatoid arthritis (have an appt in March with a specialist to see). Or if it’s just plain bad luck with being birthed with shitty knees.

All I know is I’m sitting here at 3am in pain, wanting to sleep and wishing I have some form of working pain relief that would help. I was so happy to have surgery to get rid of the major issues and be med free finally, but now it seems my body just can’t be in a happy pain free state. Ugh.",2019-12-28 09:25:10

It’s making me depressed as it feels like my condition is uncontrollable without prednisone.

Funny thing is, I transitioned into each phase one day after the doctor’s visits; I told the doctor one thing, but the next day I was the complete opposite.

I was told to restart my cycle of prednisone when I told him of my second flare up, but the following day I was completely fine so I just continued to taper the medication as normal. Fast forward two weeks, I tell my doctor I’m fine and that I was tapering the prednisone. He prescribes me Mezavant anyways to help maintain remission. The day after, I drop my prednisone intake to 5 mg, take Mezavant and end up flaring up again. This flare up has gotten progressively worse, with blood and all.

I’ll check tomorrow to see if it was the Mezavant, but I don’t know if reducing the prednisone intake was a contributing factor. It really sucks because I feel like I have no control over this and these flare ups are just random.

Also, I have no idea what foods are safe or unsafe for me. Am I supposed to be feeling something after I eat anything unsafe? My bowel movements happen way too long after I eat anything to discern the problem foods. It feels like even if I control my diet and take out common problem foods, nothing changes about my condition.

I was told that I would need to be put on biologics during my second flare up if my condition didn’t get better. It got better but now it’s worse. It’s like I’m being trolled by UC.",2019-12-29 06:14:04

I am at the end of my rope with this goddamned disease and could really use some advice or encouragement in this time. 

Here is a recap of my history with UC. I’ll try to make it as brief as possible for your reading (dis)pleasure, but it will probably be long. Apologies...

So I was first diagnosed with moderate to severe UC in Feb 2015. A random doctor gave me a bunch of mesalazine “sample packs” and told me to take those. Didn’t have to pay for them so that was a bonus. Supply lasted maybe three weeks and it seemed to be doing something, but when I ran out I was dumb and just didn’t even follow up with that doctor or my family doctor to talk about further course of action. I simply just stopped taking anything. 

We’ll now just basically fast forward until two months ago. The time from then until now was just an up and down rollercoaster. Never in remission, but never fully out of the woods. Terrible urgency with little to no pain was really my only symptom, so I just “lived with it.” 

Cut to two months ago where I noticed pain while wiping that progressively got worse. Finally one day I decided to put my phone down there and take a few pictures and did not like the looks of what I saw. 

Went to the clinic to get examined and was told I have a fistula. Great. Awesome news! So she puts me on these antibiotics and says come back in a week. 
I do, but in this time the fistula has now abscessed into my butt cheek near the hole and is the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced. 

So I go to see a surgeon at a clinic and he takes a look and immediately books me into the hospital that day. 
I got a colonoscopy done that I had been waiting months on to have in a city about an hour away THAT day, and a few hours later after resting and wearing off the anaesthesia from that procedure, I was put into surgery to drain the abscess and remove the fistula, and had a “cutting seton” rubber band thingee put in to keep the abscess open to drain. 

Cut to like 6 hours later about 2am and I suddenly went into septic shock while recovering from the surgery. Scariest moment of my life. Thought I was a goner for sure. Six nurses all over me jamming IV’s and needles into me and what not. I was in and out of consciousness and shit myself once, apparently. 

Vitals from noon that day on were always fairly solid. But they kept me for observation purposes and fed me non-stop IV’s and antibiotics. I was in there for a week before they released me. They had me on a Prednisone IV as well, and didn’t want to release me until they were sure that when I switched to oral that it wouldn’t lose its efficiency. Also a GI came in and started me back on mesalazine again. 

I’ve been out a week and a few days now and every day seemed to be getting just a smidge better than the last. More solid stools and less urgency. 

But the last couple of days I have had extreme stomach pain and the urgency has ramped back up. 
I’ve never had pain localized to my stomach area like this before. It comes in crippling waves. 
I don’t understand why this is happening all of a sudden. 

And to boot, the UC is fully attacking my joints again with arthritis in the knees and feet. Also my back today. I can barely get out of bed. 

Only pain relievers I have is Advil and I’ve been reading that’s the worst one to take but I’m in so much fucking pain I don’t care at this point. Will hit the pharmacy tomorrow and get Tylenol. 

Also have my first consultation with a very highly recommended nutritionist/naturopath tomorrow and am praying she can give me some answers. 

I have to take 2-3 sitz baths a day but other than that I have very minimal discomfort with the seton that is holding the abscess open. I can’t get over how weird it is to have that going on down there during all this. 

So sorry for the lengthy post but I am basically just crying out to cyberspace for encouragement at this point. I just want to give up with this disease but know I have to keep fighting. 

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this and for any kind words or suggestions you may have.

I'll reach out to my GI Doc first thing Monday, maybe I can take some steroids to tide me over until my infusion or maybe he can get my appointment moved up.

Now I’m all for body positivity but as a 16 year old who was “the chubby kid” it’s been pretty hard to deal with the side effects.

We are finally at peace as he begins his road to recovery and we gain our lives back.  All year long our families had absolutely awful luck with many members going to the hospital and so much other horrible stuff going on.  His father unexpectedly passed away at 48 a few weeks ago and we are just so beyond drained mentally, physically, and emotionally.  After he came out from surgery today and woke up, we both just felt it end.  Like the war is over and it's time to go see the damage and recover at home.  He has a new stoma and ostomy bag.  To keep spirits high, we named the ostomy Oswald and are going to try to have fun and enjoy one another during our road to recovery.   Our wedding and honeymoon are in June and we are already giggling about sexy tan lines from his ostomy bag on the beach, haha.

I just want to thank everyone on this sub who I've had the pleasure of talking to.  Your support through countless conversations has truly helped me get through this awful time.  I look forward to continuing to share and discuss things with you all.  This community has honestly helped me keep my sanity by being able to relate to you all.  To each and every single one of you, I am so sorry you have been impacted by this horrendous disease and want you to know that I truly care about all of you.  Whether you have UC or are supporting someone who does, you are in my prayers.  And never forget, don't ever be ashamed for who you are or the problems you have!  If you shit yourself in the car or in public or wherever, don't forget that everyone has their own problems (and everyone shits)!  Don't feel embarrassed, find reasons to laugh at yourself.  Our many public poop incidents brought us closer as a couple (and will definitely make an appearance in my wedding vows) and we have many laughs to help tolerate bad times.  We were never ashamed of our problem and you should never be ashamed of yours.  Things will get better.  Coming from the bottom of the depths of hell that was 2019, I hope you find comfort in this new year.  If you ever feel alone or feel like you are a burden, you are not.  I love you all.

Basically, Thursday morning I had some discomfort, nothing new. But by midnight, the pain was getting worse. It was just a small area below my belly button, but it kept getting worse and worse to the point of making me sick. Friday I got to hospital, have had bloods, xrays, urine, stool samples everything, and the doctors don't know what's causing it, they think it could just be a stomach bug. None of my family are ill, and the kicker is... I've had this once before, in March.

1pm on a Sunday, woke up from a nap with the kids with mild tummy discomfort, by 3pm its among the worst pain I've felt, and it's constant. Vomiting, shakes, sweats/super cold etc etc. At 7pm I go to take myself to the hospital. Am sick again, and the pain stops? I'm left with what feels like I've done 1000 situps and I'm so tender, but that was it! 6 hours and it was done! This time, not so much. Saturday morning the thing broke on me and switched to muscle soreness, but it's so sore I cant breathe properly, can't sit up, cough, wee, fart... Anything. It's so painful it's like I've lost all control.

I'm getting desperate here. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis last year, but i have had issues for about 5 years. 

Earlier this year i was on 100mg prednisone, methotrexate, antibiotics,  salazopyrin, and high levels of Vitamin D. I have tried rectal therapies including prednisone enemas but none of them seemed to make a difference.  I eventually got some relief and went off prednisone. In my mind, i don't think i was ever in full remission, but my symptoms became bearable. 

But now I have the pain again, My biggest symptom is rectal pain. It gets so bad sometimes that the inflammation extends to my pelvic region and it feels like my legs will pop off. I use Voltaren when that gets worse on my legs. I don't usually get blood, and i don't have diarrhea   


 I only have 11cm of disease, but i'm considering requesting to get my bowel removed - because basically the last couple of years i haven't really felt like a person anymore - just body that's in pain - and i want some quality of life.

I have had UC for 9 years now. It was sever the first 3-5 years and then I was fortunate enough to go into remission for quite some time. In most recent years my symptoms (if any) are usually mild.

During my sickest years I recall having so many daily pills to take that they wouldn’t even fit in my pill case (over 20 a day). The side effects were awful.

Lately my symptoms have been increasing and I know from experience that my doctor will just recommend adding an oral or suppository steroid. Which I don’t want to have to do unless I am desperate. (I am not at that point just yet)

The only medication I am on now is 4 tablets of metzavant (daily). I am curious if anyone has had luck treating mild flares with natural remedies? Or if anyone has had success seeing a naturopath doctor?

I've never felt the urge to ever post, comment, upvote, what have you. However, I've been using this subreddit as a place to read other people's experiences and it motivated me to make an account and share mine looking for advice. 

I noticed that I had UC back in late high school because of bloody stool. I didn't think much of it because it went away in a couple weeks. Since then about 2-3 weeks of the year I would have a cramping pain and bloody stool. College of my freshman year it started again. ""Just that time of year"" I thought. 

I was a bit wiser by that point and decided to have it checked out. Thus began the trust-defeating process of being passed doctor to doctor, each putting their finger in me, just to tell me: ""Yep. You're bleeding. You should see someone else"". After about 5 doctors, my symptoms got so bad i ended up in ER, I saw a GI doctor who got me in for a scope. Finally, answers. I was wrong.

After my scope my doctor just tells me that it is forsure inflamed down there and since I passed all my bacterial cultures and the Krohns test he suggested ulcerative colitis. He gave me some enema and a good luck. 

I took maybe half an enema, and after a week of neglecting the medicine I was in remission again. I decided that since it was chronic and there's nothing to do, I'll just deal with it. I went back to my normal 2-3 weeks a year flare up

I graduated college and moved back home and got a job. When I got home around may 2020, I started flaring up again. ""Just a few weeks"" I thought. Fast-forward to today, its been a constant 6 month flare up, everyday pain, blood, and almost shitting my pants at work at least 4 times a day. Ive been experimenting with different things. Marijuana, diet, exercise, stress control. Nothing seems to help. Im terrified of going back to the doctors because they never have listened to me, why start now, also the treatments I've been reading about seem to be worse than the condition! 

I was content with a couple weeks, but its been a non-stop 6 months.. is this normal? That is my most pressing question. 

TL;DR:  The past few years I've flared up maybe 3 weeks out of the year. Recently I've been nearly filling my pants with blood everyday for 6 months. What gives?

Edit: Thank you all for the advice. This was a pleasant first post experience on Reddit. I have made an appointment with a doctor and hopefully will find a good treatment option",2020-11-03 02:53:18

Hey friends,

It has been a little over a year since my UC diagnosis. The photo was taken when I was in the hospital, I felt like a Jedi in that gown :D

After reading some studies about the correlation between IBD and depression, mostly saying: with prior ibd symptoms, one with depression is more likely to develop ibd, and ibd patients are more likely to have depression, anxiety or other symptoms generally; instead of in the other way around (depression causing ibd).

I was curious if anyone here experienced depression before UC. I myself was perfectly healthy but depressed before UC. It sounds plausible to me that someone with habits to internalize their feelings (invisible mental illness) could be more prone to invisible physical illness. I hope this isn't an overly personal question to ask. If you can relate, I would like to learn how things have been for you since UC. Did it help you to be more expressive with your feelings? Was it hard to accept that this is chronic?

And big THANK YOU to everyone who is reading! I felt understood and not alone more than forever when I found out about this sub two days ago. I wish you feel the same too. I love you for how you have been enduring all the difficult days and bringing joy to the world.",2020-11-05 00:32:52

I always go and empty my bowels before doing the enema (it's kind of my natural time to go anyway like a couple hours after dinner) but it didn't matter. I would either have to go like 30 seconds after the enema was in me or i'd hold it for maybe a half an hour before i just felt it pooling in me and i had to get it out. I would also have a poorly formed bowel movement at the same time generally, almost like the enema was working like a normal enema and making me go. This only ever happens during a flare.

Long time lurker, first post... I wanted to share what might be a helpful tip.

I got diagnosed in 2018 after my bf forced me to go to the hospital after i showed him the blood i had been having for about two weeks (denial is a powerful thing) and was put on mesalazine pills. They helped me have solid stools but I still went often and had a fair bit of blood every time. Then I got put on the enemas and they really helped. For the next 6 months, I was generally good, not perfect but good. Then things got quite bad again, going a lot a lot a lot, with considerable blood and no shape. My doctor said let's do biologics but I really didn't want to. At this point, I just couldn't retain the enemas though so I figured i had no choice. I actually had stopped taking them because I would have to go the second they went me or, at best, 30 minutes later.

And then came the day I would never forget... I woke up late after new year's eve party and wasn't hungry. It was time for my bf and I to go back home and we had a long, long ride. I didn't eat anything because I didn't want to go to the bathroom and when we got back home my bowels just felt... like pleasantly empty. I decided to do the enema. It went through no problem. No pain, no horrible feeling of being full and bloated and gassy. I walked around my apartment like i hadn't done one at all. And then I had a big healthy meal. From there, I started doing basically a 24 hour fast and then doing my enema and then eating a big meal after the enema. I did this for a couple weeks. Everything had cleared up and then I returned to eating normally and was able to take the enema no problem again and I do it generally twice a week. But whenever I'm in a flare, I return to this approach, doing the enema every night after fasting for the day. Might sound crazy to have a feast after doing an enema but my issues have always been with food consumed before the enema, not food consumed after, even if it's a large amount. 

TLDR- Fasting the whole day might help you retain the enema, especially when you're in a flare. Do this as a reset and then try to go back to eating normally... unless you're into OMAD which i know is popular with some folks.",2020-11-06 20:21:54

3680,Flare and Med Question,,7,jpve12,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/jpve12/flare_and_med_question/,9,"Hi All!

Will try to make this as short as possible but there is a lot to unpack so bear with me.

I am a 46 y/o female, dx'ed with UC, IBD, GERD about 6 years ago. Thankfully have a great GI dr. who does annual endoscopy and colonoscopy. I have been on a regimen of Apriso that has been working well to control flares.

Fast forward to October of 2020 - started feeling sick at the beginning of the month, nausea, fatigue, back pain, etc. Kind of blew it off until I thought it was a UTI. Went to my Gyn on Oct. 12th - she ordered a transvaginal ultrasound (showed ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids) and treated me for a UTI even though the quick strip urine test was negative. Two days later, pain intensified, ended up in ER with appendicitis that was dx'ed via CT scan. Had appendectomy on the 15th, came home on the 16th.

Had HORRIBLE post surgery constipation - like I didn't poop for 9 days post-op. Surgeon said this was normal, had me discontinue pain meds (Percocet) and start Miralax and Dulcolax to get things moving.   I had already started drinking prune juice and eating oatmeal on my own to see if that would help. Did that and finally got relief but it went too far the other way - had diarrhea and bad gas.

Went for post-op visit - incision scars looked good no signs of infection. Fast forward to 3 days ago, had horrible abdominal pain, ended up back in ER, another CT scan - nothing remarkable except that part of my colon was not ""distended"" so they could not visualize it and degenerative disc disease in L5/S1 which I dealt with back in 2011 with a herniated disc. Radiologist thought abdominal pain and colon finding could be related to the UC and ER doc recommended follow-up with GI dr. So no answers from 2nd ER trip as to what could be causing the pain. 

Saw my primary dr yesterday who is VERY methodical (thank God!) and he was asking about my UC, meds, etc. I realized I hadn't taken the Apriso since probably early October. He prescribed Gabapentin for my back (have to follow up with ortho for that) and wants me to see my GI dr but I can't get an appointment until January! Primary doc thinks the surgery, subsequent constipation, Miralax/Dulcolax, and lack of taking the Apriso were the perfect storm for a flare.

I re-started the Apriso yesterday but my question is twofold - could this be a UC flare, and if so, how long does it typically take for the anti-inflammatory meds like Apriso to kick in? I am a highly anxious person to begin with, so this has me terrified that it could be colon cancer even though I have had colonoscopies every year since 2014.

Has anyone had a similar experience or any words of wisdom to calm me down a bit? I asked the GI dr's office to put me on a cancellation list so I can go in sooner rather than later. I also have a follow-up with the gyn and my primary on the 18th. 

Right now the pain is slightly less but still there. I feel like part of it is that I have not been active - resting on couch since the 16th and my back has been so bad. 

Any insight or words of support/wisdom appreciated!",2020-11-07 19:30:00

Diagnosed 1 yr ago (Moderate pancolitis). 1st Q - Hi. So I have IBD (Ulcerative Colitis) and follow the SCD diet to manage symptoms. I use my fitnessplanner to track my intake and I'm aiming to gain/maintain weight. My fat intake is very high from healthy fats such as olive oil/coconut oil, avocado fish and nuts but I consume around 200g of it per day. I am not on a ketogenic diet so I was wondering if this is a healthy way to continue? I can't eat any grains so my main calorie source has to be from fats as fish and veggies aren't too high in calories! My macros for yesterday for example were 17% carb (108g) - 70% fat (196g) - 13% protein (84g). Thanks. 
2nd Q - What are people's experiences of working out intensely/lifting weights to gain muscle etc. I have this paranoia that too much physical exertion from working out causes inflammation and has caused me to flare in the past which has meant having to stop working out while I recover. Does anyone else experience this? I guess what I'm saying is I'm afraid to exert myself (as you need to do to see real results) without causing harm or risking inflammation in the body. Thanks.",2020-11-07 07:47:55
3687,Anyone gone wheat free?,terribeth1,3,jply4x,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/jply4x/anyone_gone_wheat_free/,5,"Saw my favorite Gastro on Monday. He suggested trying wheat free to see if it would help. Made it very clear it wasn’t gluten (I’ve already been tested for intolerance, celiac, allergies), there’s a protein (?) or marker(?) in wheat that they’ve found could cause inflammation. I read something about it years ago, but never thought much of it. 

Anyone gone this route? The market for gluten/wheat free stuff has changed so much over the last 10+ years that it’s not a crazy change. We’ve been testing out gluten/wheat free things off and on for a while now because of how easily accessible items are. It’s more sandwiches and burgers, since the goto for a ‘bun’ is lettuce... that’s a no from me (as it is for most of us).

3689,IBD/UC Diagnosis Process After Biopsy Results,spooks10,7,jpjric,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/jpjric/ibduc_diagnosis_process_after_biopsy_results/,6,"Hello, first time poster here!

I just got the biopsy results from my colonoscopy from last week and have some questions, sorry in advance for the long post! 

So my results are: chronic active colitis, focal active inflammation in the epithelium and chronic infiltrate and expansion of the lamina propria with architectural distortion. All of the inflammation is limited to the end of the colon and rectum from what she saw on the day of the colonoscopy. 

I got a voicemail from the GI office today saying that because the biopsies showed active inflammation, and I need follow up to discuss the diagnosis and a treatment plan.

But! There’s a gift and a curse: the full pathology diagnosis report (thanks online medical records) lists several possible diagnoses for the doctor to correlate with endoscopic and clinical findings. These are: diverticular disease colitis, ischemic colitis, nsaid colitis, or IBD. They didn’t find diverticula during the scope and I’ve never taken NSAIDS, so it can’t be those two, which leaves IBD and ischemic colitis. 

So my question: how do they know which one it is? All I can find online is ischemic colitis risk factors include cancer, bowel obstruction, older age, but I don’t have any of those and I’m 27, so IBD (specifically UC and more specifically, ulcerative proctitis if I’m allowed to guess) seems to make sense given my symptoms, but I’m not a doctor lol. 

My symptoms included: passing bloody mucous many times a day from April-August with lower abdominal pain, urgency, and I constantly felt like I had to go no matter what. I never had diarrhea but the bloody mucous got to the point that I had to carry spare underwear to work because it was a fun frequent surprise lol. I also had severe fatigue and almost passed out a handful of times but I chalked it all up to stress from working during COVID and hemorrhoids instead of the massive blood loss lol (a lot of mental gymnastics, I know). So by the time I finally went to the doctor in October, the visible bleeding had mostly stopped but they still found active inflammation which is a bummer. 

Is there any testing they could do at this point after the colonoscopy that would be helpful? I never had stool tests/Calprotectin/CRP/ESR because the GI doctor said the colonoscopy is the gold standard and based on my symptoms, she suspected an IBD from the start.

Also, if it’s mild UC (since I’m not having symptoms a lot currently that’s what I’d assume it has to be), would I need to stay on medications forever? Especially since the bleeding kind of went away on its own after 4 or 5 months? I know UC is lifelong, I think I’m just hopeful there could still be another explanation for all of this/I’m living in denial currently. But I also don’t want to end up living through that again because OH BOY I should’ve realized sooner the colonoscopy was a walk in the park compared to how I felt during the worst few months of it. I honestly thought the colonoscopy would be so so so much worse than it was. 

Any insights you guys have would be greatly appreciated :) 

Thanks in advance!",2020-11-07 04:36:09

My last dose of prednisolone was on the same day on 20th October and it's been two and a half weeks and whilst the moon face and acne have quickly disappeared, the high blood pressure remains the same. I've been checking my blood pressure at home with a blood pressure monitor and it ranges between 165 over 120 to 190 over 120.

Well, hell ensued.

I ended up in the ER twice in a week due to severe abdominal pain and vomiting. The ER was useless- doing a radiograph one time and an ultrasound the next, both of which showed I was constipated but nothing else. During all of this my anxiety dial was turned up to an almost intolerable level. I also started bleeding (true blood clots and Frank blood) from my rectum consistently a couple days each week. The blood started after my ER visits. 

I lived on bland oat meal, soup broth and noodles for ~6ish weeks and lost 25 lbs. My weight loss has slowed down but I’m still 30 pounds lighter than 3 months ago. My primary didn’t want to see me in person due to covid and insisted this was all anxiety related. She threw anti-depressants at me and scheduled an upper endoscopy but no GI referral. I dumped that gp and started seeing another one who I am actually seeing in person tomorrow (12 weeks later....but still) and will send a referral. Perfect timing too because I started bleeding again today. My vomiting and discomfort has overall subsided but is still present. I truly believe the GI came before the anxiety and not vice versa. I tried to start the anti depressants and had terrible GI side effects so stopped after 2 weeks. 

I guess I’m wondering how long most flares last? It will likely be months before I see a specialist and have any kind of testing done which is making me uncomfortable in that I’m worried they won’t catch the flare.

Well 5+ years ago was diagnosed with Ulcerative Proctitis. Generally speaking, I was able to keep things under control with Pentasa suppositories with the odd flare up. I was never viligant taking the suppositories everyday as things seemed fine.. mistake I know.

Anyhow, the last 3 months have been miserable. 15+ trips to the bathroom a day, no solid stools ever, bloody diahrrea, the works. Feeling very lethargic, out of energy constantly, cold and hot sweats intermittently. My GI upped me to Steroid Enemas which seemed to help for a few days but then things seemed to return.

Not long after I started having a pain, noticed a bump, and it gradually got more and more painful. Eventually I couldn't sit down, then I couldn't lay down, then I went to the ER last week. Turned out to be an abscess and they drained it and kept in hospital 4 days as my fever kept spiking. They tested the bacteria and also put me on anti-biotics for a week.

Fast forward to today, and I am feeling pretty darn good. I am in no pain, and I am only going to the bathroom a couple times a day. Granted, I still haven't had a solid poop yet, but no bleeding. I am still taking the steroid enemas (35+ days now), so am wondering if I should be stopping those and going back to Pentasa?

My first post here but so glad there's a community like this which I think we'll be good to be a part of 😃

Diagnosed with UC Proctitis about 10 years ago. I got switched to a new Gastro earlier this year who is super thorough and has me on  Calprotectin stool tests every month. Normally around 200 but suddenly had a couple 1000 and 700 readings. Symptoms minimal to none. So had a colonoscopy (third ever in life...seems to get harder to do the prep each time???). It came back as normal in rectum for the first time ever which is odd but I've been on a heavy suppository regime so this is good. But there is a tiny mayo 1 bit of inflammation on the ascending colon. 

Now...how can this be? UC isn't meant to have 2 affected areas not connected is it? That's Crohns isn't it? Is this really inflammation or just a badly focused image? Will my biopsy results help diagnosing? So do I just have Pan Colitis now? That's not good 😔 Diagnosis on form just says UC. Have to wait over a week before I can get the biopsy results and have another stool sample to check for possible infections just in case (not calprotectin). 

Would really appreciate any advice and sorry for the long read!",2020-11-10 17:17:53

I'm not quite sure what my aim is here apart from releasing my turmoil into the internet hive mind! 

I was first diagnosed with proctitis around 8 years ago after several months of passing blood and mucus but with few other symptoms. My memory of being diagnosed is lying groggily in a recovery room after an endoscopy and colonoscopy and a nurse thrusting a piece of paper at me with the word proctitis underlined. I was given some suppositories and sent on my way.

I remember feeling embarrassed and dismissed like I'd been making a big fuss. You see less than a year before \[GRAPHIC WARNING\] I had had non-consensual anal sex with the man who was now my husband (don't worry he's not anymore). Yup, lot to unpack there - luckily I have a great therapist. But because of this I blamed myself. Pretty soon after my diagnosis we moved abroad and started working as musicians. I figured my diet was to blame for this proctitis thing and tried to change it accordingly. For years I didn't really worry about it and didn't have many symptoms that I can recall, we went for working in holiday resorts to working on cruise ships as my marriage became slowly more toxic and abusive and eventually imploded. 

ANYWAY sorry for the history lesson. Fast forward a few years and I'm divorced with a great new partner and I'm working as a touring musician in the UK. The first time I 'flare up' I blame myself; my lifestyle is awful and I've gained weight, I drink too much and I don't eat well. So I cut out all the fun stuff, lose some weight and my symptoms vanish. Of course I don't keep this up and the next year it happens again but a bit worse and with a new fun symptom I'm called is faecal urge incontinence... basically I poop myself. This time I'm horrified - got to get on top of this! So I go to... a nutritionist... I know I know. The nutritionist again gets me to cut out all the fun stuff and again my symptoms vanish. 'I know,' I think, 'I've got this, it's all down to me I just have to CONTROL myself'.

Fast forward to this year. Ok I'm not the healthiest person in the world and I am a shade overweight (literally by about 4 pounds) but I've given up touring and I'm settled. I sleep well and I run 5k twice a week plus walking my two dogs every day. Like I say I'm not the healthiest person in the world but I think I'm doing alright. I'm studying for my masters degree in music therapy, I'm engaged and I'm happy. 

Then it all starts again but this time it's worse than ever. The bloating is endless, some days you would swear I'm 4 months pregnant. I'm on the toilet several times a day and each time passing bright red blood. Sometimes it's just blood sometimes not. The faecal urge incontinence is back and worse. 

So finally with the help of my therapist I gather up my courage and contact my actual doctor for the first time in 8 years. I've finally accepted that this is not my fault and that I shouldn't feel ashamed. The doctor listens to me (this is a phone appointment cos covid) and sends off a referral for an emergency colonoscopy as she suspects my disease has now progressed from proctitis to ulcerative colitis, I'm told it'll take two weeks and she asks if I can last that long without medication. 

This was now 6 weeks ago. I'm broken. I'm in so much pain and I can't remember the last time I went to the toilet and didn't see blood. The other week I went to A&E after phoning a medical helpline because I'd been up passing blood 6 times in the night. Apparently my blood work was absolutely fine so there was nothing that they could do which left me feeling foolish for wasting their time. I'm at a brick wall with the referral process and there's nothing to be done. 

Yesterday I drove to my University really excited because I was having a morning with a real legend in the music therapy world; a morning I'd managed to get organised for my cohort. I was about 10 minutes away when my bowels completely opened, in my car. 

I managed to get to a bathroom and clean myself up, I had to throw away my underwear and my tights. Luckily my dress had survived. I slunk back to my car, humiliated, then broke down. I cried and cried. Then I drove home completely unable to face Uni. I've had versions of this happen every week since August but yesterday broke me. Today I'm supposed to be travelling to London for my placement at a well known children's hospital; a placement I'm so thrilled to have. But I'm not going, I'm too scared of what will happen, too tired and in too much pain. 

I don't know what to do. I'm at a literal dead end with my referral all I can do is wait for them to contact me. Maybe I need to stop eating all the things I think might be triggering it off but I'm scared of this 'flare up' ending before I get my test and then where will I be? I hate this. I look ill, I'm so pale with dark circles under my eyes. My skin is dry and horrible and I just don't feel like me. 

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this out there. Maybe someone will have some advice or it might just be nice to know I'm not alone and going mad.",2020-11-10 08:03:25

I posted a while ago regarding sudden out of nowhere urinary symptoms- sensation of needing to pee right after peeing, seems like it’s coming from the urethra more often than anywhere else. This seemed to happen overnight. I’m still waiting to see a specialist, and have read a lot of things about IC, but I’m just not sure yet. I don’t really have a history of UTI’s, only two in 13 yrs.
A very specific circumstance is that I was on prednisone for exactly a year until 1 month ago. Every time I would go down a dose it seemed like I’d have some new awful symptom (panic attack’s, dizziness, strange acne, etc). About a month into my lowest dose these urinary symptoms started. So for two months on my lowest dose and 1 month since being off prednisone I have been dealing with this on and off. I can’t really find much info regarding prednisone and urinary things other than it can cause diabetes (I’m negative) and make you pee more often. Has anyone else taken prednisone and then dealt with similar symptoms from it??
I have heard withdrawal can take a bit after being on it long term, but I’m still so confused.
Thanks!",2020-11-10 01:59:02

I'm sitting here as my 2nd infusion commences. I wanted to provide an update on 2 weeks of the medication.

So first and foremost, it's working. Everyday it gets a bit better. On that note, there were about 4 or 5 days where I was waiting for the medication to fully kick in. Still had some blood in stool and pain here and that. Even then, each day I noticed an improvement and by the 6th or 7th day I felt that the drugs really were starting to work.

It was my gfs birthday around 1 week in and I stupidly decided to drink a beer; not the best idea as I had pain and urgency following, but I have hope for the future as it wasn't nearly as bad as usual, and there was no blood!

I am drinking black tea with oat milk with little side effects. It makes me go to the bathroom as caffeine does, but no blood and it doesn't ruin my day anymore. I'm probably going to try coffee in a week or so.

I quit my vegan diet during my flare due to needing a high iron diet with little fibre. I will probably start slowly reintroducing plant based meals into my diet again.

I am only going to the bathroom maybe 5 times a day, and only going #2 like once or twice of those. No blood.

All in all, holy crap what an improvement. I feel amazing, and the prognosis is great. I have a cscope in 3 months to verify everything is working but based on how I'm feeling I'm sure it's gonna look good.",2020-11-11 23:50:54

Even the side effects or symptoms I have experienced that doctors were like 🤷 about... you people were who validated me. 

I think back on the journey it took to get to a diagnosis, remission, and stabilization in my life... And now that I see things more clearly, I'm not as physically or mentally weak/vulnerable, and have found my voice with education above UC - I look back on how so many medical professionals, loved ones, and the general public failed me over and over and over again. It really is laughable now, and I hope some of you find it cathartic to share those kind of stories amongst peers.  The amount of times I wish I told people to ""shut the fuck up"" instead of crying and hiding in the bathroom, ugh my poor younger self. 

Anyways, this one takes the cake for me. I'll try to make it short and sweet - 

I was a 24 y/o woman at the start of this. I was sick for a year and a half, it resulted in me losing 30 lb in a month and a half (75 lbs @ 5' 2"") immediately. My primary doctor, upon first consultation and first meeting, opened the room door wide and just proclaimed, ""So what's going on with your weight? Are you trying to lose some pounds?"" In my head I'm think, ""no I've just been having debilitatingly painful diarrhea about 20-30 times a day among many many many other things"", instead I started sobbing. I think my primary doctor immediately realized her mistake, and I'm sure she will share that experience with many other people on how not to treat patients medical problems. 

Primary doc sent me to a dietitian, who really was trying to project anorexia on me. I took a bunch of tests, no allergies. The dietitian doubled down on her anorexia assumption, I mean she made me this amazing diet of delicious food and I wasn't eating any of it. What else would it be?! (Debilitating diarrhea 20 to 30 times a day among many other things, which I told her). Didn't make sense to her I guess.

So then it was off to an endocrinologist, who was really projecting stress, anxiety, and depression as the main cause. She projected anorexia nervosa, my life was so out of control so food was the only thing I could control. And the debilitating diarrhea that many times/day was a direct result of stress. (I suppose the stress factor isn't entirely wrong, but above and before anything else - I needed a very heavy half year long prescription to steroids, not a therapist to deal with anxiety). She tested me for all of the same things the dietitian did. Same results, obviously. My savings account started to look sad. The endocrinologist was very convinced of herself, but my intenstines/butthole really couldn't take much more inflammation. 

So then it was off to the GI doctor, finally! The home stretch! The last three doctors I saw were women and projected pretty classically sexist assumptions/behavior, the GI doctor was a very elderly man. Hm. 30 plus years of GI experience, my complete medical history in front of him, this had to be okay. The very first thing he said to me when we sat down and introduced ourselves was, ""so, we don't have any body image issues we need to be worrying about here first, do we?"" Immediate tears. This fucking asshole literally said that to me. 

I don't understand what about the sentence, ""I am having uncontrollable, debilitatingly painful diarrhea 20-30 times a day"" or ""I feel like I'm being stabbed in the side constantly, I can drink 2 red bulls and have no energy, my eyes constantly hurt in the daytime, I'm always either profusely sweating or shivering, I want to gain weight, I miss eating food, I'm not doing this to myself, I don't want this, please help me"" communicates anything remotely resembling I'm starving myself because I'm insecure, or my life is out of control and this is the only way I can find control. But I digress. 

I was switched to a female GI specialist, I did not meet her until the morning of my colonoscopy. When I woke up she immediately diagnosed me, asked me if I was experiencing XYZ/ABC (I was, and didn't even realize they were all related to UC - what a relief), and then politely belittled the older GI doctor I saw originally. Prescribed me the heavy dose of steroids, gave me her personal phone number, told me she would write me as many prescriptions as I needed and to call her anytime. 

It was the biggest victory I could have possibly had after all of the doctors, all of the comments from my peers, loved ones, and the general public. 

Typing that all out really doesn't seem laughable, but my final GI doctor validated and elevated me in ways everyone else was refusing to. And it was the start of finding my confidence in taking my life back. Now that I'm stronger, I look back at my medical journey and laugh and shake my head at the willful ignorance and hubris of the previous specialists. Smart people can be so dumb. I hope sharing the story allows you to stand up for yourself to the next person who is blindly insensitive.

My name is Dom and firstly I want to say thank you all so much. I mean this whole subreddit. This community has given me comfort and has made me feel less alone when I needed it most.

Now I'm writing here partly out of hope and partly out of frustration.

I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis about a year ago but only had two sigmoidoscopies, therefore a surgeon told me yesterday they're not entirely sure if it's UC or Crohn's.
Now last year I treated myself extremely badly physically and mentally and I think that awakened this beast that I am fighting now.
During this year of struggling with this disease I, obviously, like everyone else, have found out multiple things about my disease and tried various supplements, medicines and treatments with varying forms of success.
I tried adjusting my diet more with little slip-ups since food has always been my achilles heel. Unfortunately I let myself go a bit too much this year and was not very physically active, which is terrible on my part. 

The supplements I've tried are: (with approximate success experience in brackets) 

Vinegar capsules (none) 
Turmeric capsules (none)
Psyllium husk capsules (slight)
Spirulina (much)
Very expensive probiotics (none)
Kefir as a probiotic (slight)
Curcumin (much)

Those are the main things I've tried using while Curcumin has proven to have been most effective.

Medication-wise I've only ever been on Mesalazine including some enemas for bad days but even those kind of stopped working and I'm mostly just passing liquids and it gets worse at night for some reason. 

Now to continue, I've never been in remission so far. Since it all started on Halloween last year with me almost pooping my pants while being first row at an Opeth concert, I've only almost reached remission once in July after 1.5 weeks of my girlfriend making me curcumin infused bland foods like soups and rice. I felt like I was on top of the world for the following week before this thing kicked in with non-stop diarrhea that never went away again pretty much.

Which brings me to the current moment.
It's 6am and I've been awake for two hours lying in my hospital bed where I've been for two weeks. I was on Methylprednisone for a week and went to oral prednisone with two infliximab infusions that seem to have had no effect. My CRP dropped from 73 to 8 at first and has crept back up to 62 yesterday after 4 days. I was seen by a surgeon as they say there's no medical treatment left to try and all they've tried has failed. All they've tried is Mesalazine and Infliximab and they said due to the severe and acute nature of my colitis, I cannot be part of clinical trials or try any of the other 'mabs as they can't seem to get on top of my acute flare.

However, the conversation with this surgeon went a lot different than what I expected. He looked me straight in the eyes and said something along the lines of 'Listen, the gastroenterologists seem to want to hurry and have you get surgery asap but your CRP is only at 60. This isn't an easy decision and it's not like we have to operate today or tomorrow. You're in no danger of having an emergency or toxic megacolon, which would obviously change things and which would be dangerous. So see how you feel for a few days and then let's see how it goes, shall we?' 

I started crying immediately as I've been feeling so fucking alone. No one's allowed to visit because of corona and everyone's just been telling me bad news. My family is in Germany (I live in Scotland) and I've been feeling like a lost child lying here for two weeks because of a flare and being told there's little to no hope basically right from the get go. 

Now.
My fighting spirit is stronger than ever. I want to get better and I believe I can. I don't want to lose my gut even if the consultant working with me is giving me no hope and seems to want to rush me to surgery. I've hated my gut all my life as I considered myself fat but I've learned to love it over the last few weeks. Rock bottom makes you feel things differently and changes your views on things. It also rearranges your priorities. 

I don't know what my CRP will be today and I'm terrified. It'd be a lie if I didn't admit that. I feel tension in my gut and I've been reading about people's stories for hours now.

Has anyone come back from a point like this?
I don't want to give up on my gut.

Also, are there any other alternative medicines or supplements or anti-inflammatory anythings you've seen help? (I read about Monolaurin and Low-dose Naltrexone and would like to try them out) 
Because doctors have only been telling me what medication they can pump into me but there's more to healing than that. It's a balance of things and I want to try to take my life into my own hands if it's not too late.",2020-11-12 09:41:10

My Dr prescribed apirso but my insurance only approved the generic. I was told to take 4 pills but was given no direction on if evening or morning was better or if I should spread them out through the day... And a quick Google search didn't provide much help either.

I come to you guys because I wanted to see if anyone else was experiencing the same things I am. I've only taken 2 doeses so far and I've taken them both before bed (hoping that if I get sick I'll just wake up instead of being in pain all day). Well both yesterday and today I've woken up with horrible stomach pains but then today I started vomiting. 

My history is that I was diagnosed about 16 years ago and had taken everything known to man at the time until finally Remicade started working and I went into remission. I've had a couple flair ups over the years of course but nothing consistent until this year. It started in July and I couldn't eat. I'm a plus size woman and if you can't eat well... Yeah, it's concerning... Lol. Fast forward to today and I've had an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy just for my Dr to tell me that my entire system is inflamed and it appears I'm no longer in remission.

I just had the appointment with with new GI doc and I felt so much better after the visit. She gave me information about the disease, foods to avoid, lifestyle choices, issues that may come up with pregnancy, and listened to me when she was asking about a specific med and I told her it was too expensive, She understood and said well we can try this instead and see if it helps. She was just more informative and gave me a much clearer picture of what can be expected with the disease. The previous GI doc just gave me my diagnosis and meds and sent me on my way. She explained what the goal is which is remission and how long I need to allow the meds to take before being able to say that I am in remission. In general she was much more informative and proactive, requesting lab work, increasing my meds and letting me know to follow up in 2-3 months if my symptoms have not improved and letting me know that I would need another procedure next year to make sure that I am in remission (it won't be a colonoscopy thank GOD!) .

I am pretty fortunate, compared to some people here with UC, I don't get stomach pain, on occasion I do get a minor stomach pain, but it comes with urgency, and goes away immediately when I go to the bathroom, usually caused by gas.  The pain I get I believe is related to my UC, but is located near my left butt cheek, near my Coccyx.  I have seen my GP about the pain, had an x-ray, had a physical exam, but she found nothing that could explain it.

Tylenol on its own, is useless.  Ibuprofen on its own works, I know its bad for us, but requires 800 mg every 4 hours.  The combo of 200mg ibuprofen and 500mg Tylenol every 4 hours, is the only thing that worked.

Spoke to my pharmacist, and was given OTC codeine, 8mg with 300mg Tylenol combo.  It doesn't seem to be working, was taking 2 tablets every 4 hours.

I saw TENs, but not sure if it will work, the pain does seem to be close to the surface.

My morning routine usually consists of things to help clean out the tract, belly on down. Black seed oil is supposed to be super effective at killing infections, viruses and all those bad bugs.

Anyone else do this sort of thing? If I had only one supp. otc to use, it would be this. I'm posting cuz maybe some of y'all can test it out for yourself. I'm in a pretty stable place right now. But, I hate seeing y'all in so much pain.

Is it the Remicade that's helping me? Maybe, but it only helped me to stabilize a little. I still had symptoms. Is it the carnivore diet I'm on? Well, I don't have post eating symptoms anymore and I'm leveling out in a lot of ways. Is it the turmeric caps, the black seed oil, the boswellia powder and cinnamon I take in the morning?

Honestly, the gut's a dirty f'n place. We gotta keep it clean more than your average muggle. IMO, flares are infections of some sort or another. The immune system is triggered by a pathogen. Black seed oil helps keep things clean and clear. Well, I hope so anyway! But I'm stabler now than I have been in a long long time. I'm actually back and beyond my pre UC/Crohnie fighting weight again!

I hope this can maybe help someone who could use an idea or two. Research it. I'll post the link to the one I use at the bottom. I have it on subscribe n' save and buy a cpl bottles a month since a tbsp a day makes a bottle about a 15 day run. Godspeed n' keep ya belly clean fam

I'm at the point where I'm considering trying to go on sick leave for a month just to have some chance of stabilizing while I wait for my Entyvio to kick in (only one dose so far). Bathroom access at work is not a problem but I've had so many accidents on my commute (30-50 min by bus) which is miserable. I'm constantly sleep-deprived due to getting  up during the night, I usually end up just giving up trying to sleep around 4 am, and I work in healthcare where mistakes can be pretty serious. I'm also experiencing inflammation of my SI joint which makes it really painful some days to do anything but lie down. 

But ... I also think I might go crazy spending a month at home as work has really been my only chance to see other people during covid. I've used up all my paid sick time already so I would be looking at missing a few cheques, I wouldn't have any problems making rent or anything but it would definitely suck. I'm not anemic or anything so I feel weird asking for sick leave just because I'm tired and can't hold it on the bus.

I guess I'm just wondering if people have found taking time off to be worth it in helping them reach remission. Or if you have any advice on other accommodations I could ask for that might help.

2. What meds are you on with Methotrexate? I am on Salazopyrin, a high dose of Vitamin D, Folic Acid (because of the Methotrexate) - and i might be gooing to budesonide enemas 
3. How effective do you find Methotrexate? I take it the dose once per week, But I find it really effective at the start of the week, and then it starts tapering off at the end of the week. But maybe the high dose will make that better
4. What side effects do you think you have from it? I think it may cause a little hair loss, but then again UC itself makes me lose a lot more hair than the methotrexate. I also think it may cause dry skin, but apart from that, i don't think there is any more for me.

I have not been administered any medication yet but I thank everyone who urged me to pursue some (I see a doctor soon). 

I had a weird experience though. I forgot my coffee at work and instead drank one of those 5-hour energy shots to get me up. The next day at work, I notice that my pain, blood and urgency were A LOT better. I raked through everything I did differently the day before. The only outlier: the 5-hour energy shot. 

I look at the label to see what's in it, and besides the normal energy drink stuff (taurine, caffeine), it is LOADED with vitamin B-12 and B-6 (~~124% daily dose). I thought that maybe it was the vitamin B making me feel better. After work I picked up some sublingual vitamin B-12 and take 124% daily dose a day. 4 days later i am completely symptomless, no blood, no pain. I will still be going on medication, however,it seems that excessive B-12 put a stop to my 6 month flare up. 

With your doctor's permission, it may help you too. Its no cure, and it likely won't work for many. But if it helps even one of you, I'd be very happy!!

I had been flaring since December/January, with daily heavy bleeding, even prednisone did nothing for it. 
The Simponi put me in remission almost immediately but I now have joint and nerve pain that can be agonising or manageable depending on the day. 

Seeing as these same biologics are used to treat RA why would it help my digestive tract symptoms but make the joint pain worse?

I will call my gastroenterologist to arrange blood tests, but I'm wondering if any of you have experience with this and if your doctor had an explanation or advice to help.

A few weeks ago I made a post about how I would be receiving an iron infusion and asking what everyone's experiences are, given my nerves.  Thank you to everyone who contributed, it really helped my nerves!  I knew my ferritin was less than 1 going into the infusion (although they didn't test my hemoglobin at my last blood test for some reason) but I wasn't having any symptoms, until the days leading up to my infusion where my head was constantly aching.

I had my iron IV yesterday morning, and I'm happy to report the infusion itself was uneventful!  My boyfriend's mom who is a nurse suggested I use EMLA cream and tagoderm so I would be numb at the site, as my needle anxiety has been high lately.  The nurse doing the infusion thought it was a great idea.  Didn't even feel the needle go in, it was great! Totally recommend.

At the end of my infusion, another nurse came in asking what my hemoglobin was last it was tested and I told her it hadn't been checked recently, but last I knew when I was hospitalized it was around 80.  She then told me my hemoglobin as of that morning was 57 (normal is 120-160).  I kind of freaked out, and was expecting a blood transfusion, as were the nurses.  But they called my hematologist and he said that the iron IV should hopefully bring up my hemoglobin levels, and sent me home. I was told that if I have any dizziness, shortness of breath, pain, etc. to go right to the ER and I assume I'll have the transfusion.

I'm just wondering if any of your hemoglobin levels have been crazy low and if your iron infusion actually helped.  I was told it could take 7-10 days for the full effects to take place.  I thought I would feel a big boost in energy, but honestly I feel the same.  My head is still throbbing today, which I know can be a side effect of the iron infusion, but also a side effect of low hemoglobin... Ohh when will the suffering end? lol",2020-11-17 18:56:17

\*\*\*\*

**Nov 24 update** \- CMV colitis was confirmed by histological exam. He is on ganciclovir by IV twice a day. Tapering on steroids from 48 mg now down to 30 mg and will keep going down over the antiviral course. 3 days after anti-viral medication began, his bowel movements are down to 3-5 times a day from the 6-8 times he was going before. Still bloody but less blood than before. His weight has stabilized ... increasing marginally. His haemoglobin levels are rising .. he had dropped to 8.5 .. now up to 9.8. Likely due to multiple factors - PICC line is a huge help and likely he is starting to respond to the anti-viral. Docs feel we need to give his body time to heal with the anti-viral before re-assessing remicade induction continuation or moving to Xeljanz.

Thanks everyone for your thoughts and wishes below. Long road ahead for us ... but staying hopeful and strong.

\*\*\*\*\*

My 12 year old son is in a pediatric hospital in philly diagnosed with severe UC (pancolitis). Confirmed via colonscopy and biopsy. In his first hospital admission, he started to respond to IV methyprednisolone and remicade infusion with fewer bowel movements and less blood. They discharged him after his pucai was below 35 and bowel movements came down to 4. At home he was on oral prednisone. In a few days he started to get worse 6-8 bowel movements, more blood and less formed stools.

We rushed him back to the hospital where they put him on IV steroids, no improvement, gave second infusion of remicade, no improvement. Started on quadruple antibiotic cocktail, no improvement. Did  another sigmoidoscopy and reconfirmed high level of inflammation. Second biopsy done, waiting for results to rule out CMV infection. He was also rapidly losing weight ... picc line inserted to feed him intravenously.

Docs now considering Xeljanz to see if it would help him.

His diet is mainly low fiber hospital food until the picc line was put in. He has now spent 18 of the last 30 days in hospital.

I wanted to reach out to this community to see if anyone went through a similar experience as a child or if your child went through a similar experience and what did you try to get on the path to recovery.

Any counsel would be helpful and comforting.

Thank you

Long time listener, first time caller! I need any advice you can give me. 

I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Proctitis about five and a half years ago, at 31, when I had my first flare. At the time it felt like the world is ending, but I have come to learn to live with it, more or less. (I am in a great position of working from home for the last ~6 years, so I am near the toilet at all times. What sucks is that I have come to not like going out of the house that much, but it is manageable at this time)

I had three flares since then (I consider myself very lucky, reading through the posts on this subreddit, as I got it easy), which lasted for about a month each, and were all handled by adding Pentasa suppositories to my usual Pentasa therapy (I am at 2x2g/day currently, along with Folate pills).

My last colonoscopy was during my last minor flare in October, and, except a small part of the colon which is affected since the start, according to my GI I am fine. (the blood went away about five weeks after I started using suppositories, as opposed to two to three weeks in earlier flares)

Here comes the question - do you have any advice you can give me, to stop this from spreading? 

Occasionally I go into a rabbit hole of reading all the posts on this subreddit, and get terrified that my state will worsen, as I really don't feel affected by this disease that much at this point, but it is always somewhere in the back of my head (and butt).

I try to take care of my diet, drink alcohol moderately (had a few occasions this year when I overindulged, but mostly it's a glass or two of wine, or a shot here or there). I have two kids (3 and 5), so my stress level is a bit higher than ideal, and am not working out as much as I would like to (as in - almost never).

Reading this post I feel like I am bragging, considering the mildness of the case I have, and sorry if it comes off that way, but I would really appreciate any advice you would have, that would leave me in this state. 

(sorry if something was awkwardly worded, English is my second language)

Thank you, all, and I wish you a healthy gut!",2020-11-19 09:51:18

So I am currently on Remicade (5mg/kg every 6 weeks) and have been for \~5 years. Ever since I started the medication, I have experienced some pretty unwanted brain fog and other strange cognitive side effects, which I am certain is directly related to the medication as it is always most severe right after my infusion and then continuously lessens until I receive my next dose. FWIW, I've also just recently seen a neurologist who confirmed that what I'm experiencing is not related to any extraneous health issues and pointed to Remicade as the likely culprit.

Although the Remicade has been pretty great at maintaining gut health (only a few minor flairs during this 5-year window, only my most recent requiring a course of prednisone), the side effects have become even more of a burden as I recently started a much more physically and mentally demanding job, and the initial two weeks after receiving a dose are unbearable. I've spoken with my GI about the side effects, and he's had me try every vitamin/probiotic supplement out there to no avail. He has now informed me that our next step would be switching to another biologic with a different mechanism (either Entyvio or Stelara).

Just curious to see if (a) people think the imputed risk/reward relating to maintaining gut health/not experiencing as severe of side effects is worth the medication change, (b) if anyone can personally speak to potential side effects associated with these other biologic classes and c) if anyone has any experience transitioning from Remicade to another biologic?

Hi all,

Found this Youtuber who advocated eating fermented/unpasteurised foods as they contain probiotics(see below). Currently, I'm considering myself in remission (rare flare ups occur but daily continuous pain has subsided)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR-g54EFJa0&ab_channel=KennyHonnas

(This is an overview video - I recommend watching all the videos as they are all very informative)


----

Probiotics: 
---
I'm based in the UK and here are the products I've been using as probiotics:

https://www.chucklinggoat.co.uk/product/live-goats-milk-kefir/

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Loving-Foods-Award-Winning-Sauerkraut-Unpasteurised/dp/B07YLZTGCK/

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Loving-Foods-Award-Winning-Sauerkraut-Unpasteurised/dp/B07Z2R8XNB

You can also consider Biotiful kefir in the UK as an alternative.

I drink one glass of kefir in the morning and have a spoon full of FERMENTED/raw cultured vegetables for lunch and dinner.

I also have raw honey for breakfast which is unpasteurised. 

Note: Good quality probiotics can be distinguished by a long shelf life. It's better to buy vegetables/kefir with a 3 month shelf life for example over a 1 week shelf life as it will have more probiotics.

Note: You can also make these yourself at home! You don't need to purchase them if you wish to save money (check out the youtube channel as he shows you how to do this from home). 

----

Prebiotics:
---

You're supposed to eat probiotics and prebiotics together. Here's what I eat:

blueberries/butternut squash/courgette

I have blueberries with every meal (usually as part of smoothie for lunch and dinner). 

Note: You want to avoid fruit/vegetables that have roughage (or high fibre content) as this will hurt you. 

----

Intermittent Fasting:
---

Eating strictly only 3 times a day (i.e., no snacks) has helped to alleviate symptoms. 

----

Additional details:
---

I've noticed I flare up when I overeat. I've only flared up once seriously in the last 3-4 months and that was when I ordered a pizza takeaway and had a desert (of note is that I could have the desert without serious problems and I've also eaten pizza before without severe issues). Simply eating too much food in one setting can set off symptoms.

---

Studies reviewing gut dysbiosis and the role of fermented foods:
---

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101585/

https://gut.bmj.com/content/48/1/132

----


Note: I've added wheatgrass tablets last few days and am waiting to see if this does anything (currently I'm thinking its not helping). Does anyone have thoughts of wheatgrass?

All credit goes to Kenny. His youtube videos are professional and if you want to learn more I recommend you check his channel out. FYI he now has a nutritional science masters degree (if people are persuaded by authority bias like I am lol)

I'm not affiliated with any of these products/services. Obviously, take care before you consider dietary/medicinal changes :)

EDIT: By raw vegetables I mean fermented/unpasteurised veggies. Apologies for the confusion

I'm mad at my friends for not even calling me once while I was in the hospital for two weeks. 

I'm mad at the world for being so cold and unforgiving. And yes, I realize there are people who have it a lot worse than me. And that is exactly why this hurts. I just can't stop thinking about how horrible the world is, how even children die of cancer. And how people in areas without access to healthcare just have to suffer in silence. Maybe they don't even know what's wrong with them. I hadn't even heard of UC or Crohn's 3 months ago. I can't accept the fact that I'm in this much pain and still one of the lucky ones.

For the past week even on the Lialda more frequent diarrhea is back, though no blood this time fortunately. Stabbing pain in my side that is better but still there.

Question 2. What to do about the desperate thirst? I am craving water constantly but trying to carefully restrict it to not mess myself up more given that my pee is already basically clear.",2020-11-20 05:13:54

I'm 23 was diagnosed on my birthday a little over a year ago and I was on a Mesalmine for 6 months in mexico I then had a huge flare which landed me in the hospital in Mexico again got put on another med which did nothing apparently and my condition was getting worse.

 A month ago I went into the hospital in the US got diagnosed with CDiff infection and UC got put on a steroid and got put back on mesalmine. Took that for 30 days 1 800 3 times a day. Now they upped my dosage to 2 800s 3xs. Without telling me they changed it.

 First day on that feel the same. The thing with this mesalmine med vs my old one is this one gives me nausea usually once a day every couple days never had that. Does anyone have good ways to deal with it or what's causing it? 

I have a colonoscopy scheduled in 5 weeks as a checkup so fingers crossed things get better by then. I used to for about a month not be able to leave the house I was going to the rr every 30 mins basically.  Now I'm at maybe once every 2hrs 1 1/2hrs. Improvements  I guess. During the night though i do wake up every hour to go and then if i go a lot during the night i won't go much during the day. 

I've also noticed and have gotten used to basically having to go to the restroom immediately after eating. It used to be during meals sometimes one bite in it was horrible. Does it get better? 

I hope I get some responses honestly the only reason I'm alive is this reddit seeing people also having to deal with this and making it work and seeing improvement gave me hope so thanks.",2020-11-20 04:53:57

Long story short, about a week and a half ago I noticed a few lymph nodes in my neck and shoulder were swollen but no big deal because they weren't painful. At the time my joint pain, fatigue, and GI symptoms increased so I thought I was at the start of a flare and the lymphs were related. My calprotectin hasn't come back yet, but my regular blood work all looks normal. Some of my WBC counts increased from last draw but not enough to be considered abnormal.

Anyway, the lymph nodes have become pretty painful so I went to get a covid test just incase. Negative for covid, but the Dr said it was more likely to be Mono based on the symptoms. No idea how I would have gotten mono while being extra mindful of sharing germs and everything right now, but I'm waiting to see my PCP to confirm it with a test.

This is my first ""big"" virus since being immunocompromised. I'm on Remicade and sulfasalazine, a little worried that I could take a turn and get worse, or have my next infusion delayed because of active infection. Wondering if any of you have had a similar experience/symptoms and how it went for you? Or if you had similar symptoms and it wasn't mono?

A little worried about those more serious remicade side effects but trying to stay hopeful. Hope all of you are managing okay <3",2020-11-21 22:46:14

I posted a picture of myself in the hospital last weekend due to a severe flare-up asking for words of encouragement and positivity. Those of you who did, thank you so much, I really appreciate this community. I’m still here in the hospital, I’ve been here for a full week. I’m still experiencing diarrhea, extreme stomach pain and bleeding when I go to the bathroom. 
My GI doctor and the doctor who has been coming to my room have not really done much? I had a colonoscopy that showed all of the inflammation and they say I’m ready to go home.. but I’m scared. I want to be better. I want to be able to care for my two children and go back to school. Not have to worry about where the bathroom is or anything I eat fucking my stomach up. 
My question is (and I know every one is different) how do y’all handle flare-ups? I wasn’t doing my best to take care of my body when this flare started and that’s why it got so bad. Doctors haven’t really advised me on what to eat/not eat or what I can do from home until a new treatment plan starts. Any tricks or special things to avoid?

I will get a sharp drastic pain in my lower left abdomen currently upwards of 10times a day and 2-3 times in the middle of the night and I immediately have to go to the bathroom. Once I'm there, I go through the process of internalizing all this pain mixed with occasional grunting and even screaming. Its horrible. It feels like someone is twisting my intestines like they were trying to squeeze water out of rag. It feels like someone will stab me in the intestines too and I instinctively grab my lower abdomen as I limp my way to the bathroom. This pain during a flare up is worse than the blood, the constant shitting, the dehydration, the lack of energy, waking up in the night, not eating, all of it. I dread getting this pain and rushing to the bathroom where I then sit there frantically moving back in forth trying to internalize all the pain. Im currently going to the bathroom at least 10 times a day and every single time its met with this intense lower intestinal pain that has me questioning why tf im alive lol. 


Im not here for sympathy or empathy. My main question is: How many of you have pain like this?

 I'm talking strict intestinal pain when shitting, not joint pain, nerve pain, or anything else. I just haven't seen much talk about it


Secondary question: I genuinely would love to hear advice on how you deal with this pain?

 I havent found something that helps drastically. Sometimes pushing my intestines in with my fist where it hurts will help, but thats about it. Besides that its just screaming and trying to stay composed.

My healing journey took me to many medical facilities, to the deep jungles of the Amazon and to the toilet, many times. To keep it succinct: After four years of being really ill - I am talking being bed-bound for months - and two years of not being ill anymore, I can attest to the following; maybe this is helpful for people who have a similar etiology or colitis type:  


1. My symptoms are caused by purines, specifically uric acid. I have had very bad attacks triggered by uridine (oh god), agmatine (has purinergic metabolites) and creatine (also influences uric acid). My body probably does not excrete it efficiently enough.
2. Very high level intake of Vitamin D stops all symptoms. When I had the bloodiest phase of my life where I was close to death, I took 100k IU of D3 every day for a week. I went from 30 red mucus shits to a single proper one in the course of this week.

Keeping away from uric acid and taking relatively high doses of Vitamin D, I have had no problems anymore for two years. I only had a few days of not feeling too well after using creatine for a while, but after stopping that and upping Vitamin D, it went away very quickly. 

These nightmarish four years feel like a lifetime ago, and the disease plays no part in my life anymore - well, I still have to catch up, but I am free from symptoms.

This past year, however, has been flare after flare with worsening symptoms. My doctor had me go through another course of Prednisone (after which I caught Covid, so that was fun), but now that I’ve tapered off of it, I’m still flaring and am seeing no improvements in symptoms.

My gastro and I decided to first see about adding Mesalamine enemas to see if a more direct approach might have a positive impact given my body’s initial response to the oral treatment. I had been prescribed these enemas in 2014 when I was first discharged from the hospital and I had a lot of difficulty with them, so I’m concerned about trying them again, but my doctor also said that if I don’t see an improvement after a few weeks to a month, we’ll have to do another colonoscopy and seriously consider a biological option.

He gave me some info about the most common treatments that are used so we can make an informed decision if/when the time comes. I’m kinda nervous about all this. I see a lot of posts from others who are starting Remicaid or Humera for the first time.

Well I never fully went into remission. On Halloween I got a major flare and it went to nothing but blood really quick. Then I could keep even liquid down so I went to the ER. After a CT Scan they admitted me. But the hospitals are full here cause of the rising COVID cases. They put me on IV steroids and after 6 hours in the hallway (needed rooms for covid patients) I was able to get a room. Felt okay, was able to eat and had loose stool but when they sent me home on oral steroid I started bleeding again 2 days later.

I was brought to the ER again and they admitted me again. After a week, I was able to leave again. They did an infusion and I am doing much better and have solid bm’s and only 1 a day! I cannot remember the last time that happened!

So my worry is that they are starting me on a steroid taper. They want me off steroids cause of the negative impact to my health (I’m put into diabetic status and my immune system is shot). It sounds like my immune system will always be shot now cause the infusions are a biologic. 

I was on mesalamine before when I had the flare. They took me off it. If I start getting bad again... I’m worried that means surgery. With all the covid patients and issues with rising cases (we are a major hotspot) I am getting super nervous about my condition. It’s causing my blood pressure to rise a lot. 

I’m wondering, those who get infusions, did you notice getting sick more often? Do you get sicker, line have worse symptoms? Am I over thinking this? 

If I need surgery (I have UC so it is an option), does that mean having a bag for the rest of my life? Ugh I cannot sleep with all this in my head and the steroids are not helping either.",2020-11-23 03:31:55

Imuran has given me complete remission for 7 years and a normal life and peace of mind. 

Initially had 2 major flares 7 years ago, was hospitalised and needed remicade and was the reason I was put on Imuran. 
Now they are taking it away based on the minor increase of certain cancers and the fact I've had no symptoms. 

I argue ive had no symptoms because of the imuran. 
They argue ive had no symptoms because the disease is dormant and doesn't require it. 
I argue that when it flares again in the future  and wakes up again then ill have no defense against another major flare. 
And given I go from asymptomatic to full on immobilised flare up in 24hrs i could never go on holiday again or plan an event that costs £££.

Thanks again for the support in the last thread. COVID beat me up good for about five days. Was very tired, had body aches and a headache, fever and sweats, and the anxiety was terrible. It's hard to tell what was causing what, the COVID, anxiety or UC. It was a very difficult week. 

After taking to a public health nurse and my GI I was given the okay to start prednisone. I started taking it last Monday. I was able to get my Entyvio infusion this Monday as well. 

So while I don't have COVID symptoms anymore UC continues to flare unabated mostly. The anal fissure I developed after a bout of hard stools caused by Imodium is still giving me much grief. I have to apply lidocaine before and after movements. Since four days on prednisone bowel frequency has gone down at least. I'm experiencing all the usual side effects I get from prednisone like restlessness and then crashing midday with no energy. 

Another thing I'd like to add is how weird it is to go less than six times a day or not gag and force down food despite not having an appetite. After months and months of diarrhea I find myself questioning what normal digestion is supposed feel like. When I was in remission I never thought about it because normal is what's expected so I only notice when things go wrong. I know my digestion was never perfect, even in remission I go about three times a day. That's all I want really. To get back there.

It's tough but I cannot overstate how thankful I am for all the messages of hope and support I got. I have an appointment with my GI in December and I was also given a referral to a surgeon just to talk things over since I'm flaring on my third biologic.

Trying to get Stelara approved.,MarshmallowCat14,10,k24ect,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/k24ect/rant_so_frustrated_with_insurance_and_doctors/,9,"I am so fed up with dealing with my insurance (BCBS), my rude and lazy doctor's nurses and the specialty pharmacy right now. I had a colonoscopy Nov. 5. First, my doctor, who doesn't seem to know what he is talking about, (I'm seeing someone new next week) was holding things up. He kept telling me to stay on Entyvio even though it's been 5 months, and it has done absolutely nothing! He has only been my doctor for about 2 years because my last one who I really liked moved out of state, but he kept saying he saw improvement from the Entyvio in my scope. This makes ZERO sense because my last scope was in July 2018 and showed almost no inflammation (I was on 25 mg prednisone during that scope and had zero UC symptoms), and this recent scope showed moderately active left-sided UC! Plus, that last scope was 2.5 years ago, and I've been on tons of meds since then, so even if my scope had looked better, which it did NOT, it wouldn't even make sense to say that the reason was due to Entyvio! I asked via MyChart a couple times why he thought I had improved, and he never answered that.

So, I've been trying to get started on Stelara ever since the scope Nov. 5. The shot portion was approved Nov. 17 through the specialty pharmacy, but of course, I need the infusion first. My doctor's office is always telling me incorrect information. They were telling me everything was approved. So, I call BCBS several times over the past two weeks, and I end up talking to like 4 different people each time, and everyone tells you a different thing! Most tell me to call my doctor's office or the infusion center, which I already have, and the infusion center says to call BCBS!  Half of the BCBS reps are totally clueless even when I explain the situation very clearly and thoroughly, and they tell me it's already been approved. Then finally someone the other day told me the infusion part is still pending because that part goes through medical. I call again today to check on it, and the person I was talking to kept telling me the entire thing has been approved. Not true! I literally have to re-explan the situation like 5 times even to the same rep. It's like they don't even listen or care at all. I am so fed up. And my doctor's office acts like I'm bothering them every time I call or write them through MyChart, so I end up feeling really annoying, but all I'm trying to do is get started on a new medicine ASAP so I can get off steroids because I already have osteoporosis from prednisone at age 36! This entire year I was on Uceris and had no symptoms, but now because I listened to my doctor when he told me to keep tapering to see if Entyvio was working even though my symptoms were coming back, now the Uceris won't work anymore! He literally told me ""we want to see blood and diarrhea"" when I told him my pain was coming back when I had started to taper. If my symptoms start coming back during a Uceris taper, I usually go back to daily pretty quickly, but this time I listened to him and kept tapering for 3 weeks, and then I could never get my symptoms under control again.

And then the scope made all hell break loose. My symptoms were so severe, I almost went to the hospital. Called the on-call GI, and he told me to either go to the hospital or take prednisone at home. I had some leftover that is expired. He told me to follow up with my doctor. I did so, and my doctor told me Uceris and pred are ""interchangeable"" and that I ""can try a little prednisone if I want to,"" but he wouldn't give me any, and when I asked him if I could have some prednisone so I could do a proper taper and not be using expired 5 mg pred., he told me to just go back on the Uceris, without even tapering pred. But I did not listen to him because he is making NO sense. Uceris was not working and I waited a full month for it to work again. Luckily, I have enough (expired) pred to get me through a quick taper. I feel like he is acting like I'm just making up my symptoms or something even though he literally just scoped me and saw my colon. He was really unprofessional before the scope too and it was a really horrible experience. I've had like 8 scopes in my life and they've always gone well except this one. 

Anyway, thanks for listening to my long rant. I am so frustrated right now. None of the biologics so far have worked for me other than Remicade for a measly 2 months, so that's frustrating too! I have 2 telehealth appointments in December with IBD specialists for second opinions, so I'm hoping one of them is a better doctor, even though they're both a farther drive away from me.",2020-11-27 17:33:42

I want to apologize for how graphic this will be, but I really need opinions. I have been having the absolute worst time with my thrombosed hemorrhoids. Every single morning... hell starts. First bowel movement - slight diarrhea with mucus. Second bowel movement - the mother load. Solid bowel movements (usually) but severe straining due to my inflamed rectum. After this BM, the urgency is non-stop and it feels like a balloon inflated in my rectum all day. The only thing that helps is icing down there. 

Some backstory... I started my first infusion of Entyvio back in August. Around that time, I was in a fissure cycle. It would break open, flare, heal, break open.. etc. My gastro referred me to a rectal surgeon to look at my issues. At the time, I was only experiencing issues with my fissure. He recommended Botox injections, and so I went ahead and did that in hopes that with the relaxed rectal muscles, things would heal. Several weeks passed by and the epsom salt baths, and Nifedipine+Lidocaine ointment, and the Botox really helped heal the fissure, however I then immediately started to develop hemorrhoids from.. what I believe were the injections/shots. It was severely painful! Fast forward to late October - I started experiencing severe tenesmus (from what I believe are the internal and external hemorrhoids), and my Gastro put me on Uceris to relieve the tenesmus. I took my last dose two days ago, and I still have urgency and frequent diarrhea. Imodium helps some, but it’s all rectal. I set up an appointment with my PCP to look at the external hemorrhoids, because I heard they can ligate/remove them.So brings me to my questions

1. What am I doing wrong?
2. Is my Biologic working or is Uceris still masking symptoms?
3. Should Entyvio rid me of most of these symptoms if it’s actually working, and is it safe to say that I’ve failed this Biologic if I’m still experiencing urgency?

I’m just a confused mess, and I feel like I am just at a breaking point with my gastro. I’ve failed every medication, other than Entyvio, and I can’t get clear answers as to whether or not it’s actually working. I get the whole “Well it’s still too early to tell.” Seriously!? I feel like I’m going insane. I would really love to hear anyone’s input on this. Is this normal during the healing phase? And if the hemorrhoids get removed, will i get my life back, ya think?",2020-11-29 00:48:46

&#x200B;

So I've posted in here before, but I wanted to see what others experiences were. I am about 6ft, 185... muscular and have been lifting weights for about the last 8 years or so. 

I had a small flare this past late spring which led my doc to put me on Mesalamine enemas in addition to the lialda I was already on. He had said, then, that if it did not get better, he would be putting me on what he called ""a short prednisone taper"" to get the inflammation under control. However, the enemas did the trick. In short, I had to get off them per his instructions to see if it solved the problem, but about a month later, a little blood returned, so he put me back on the enemas every other night. 

&#x200B;

Seemingly, I am doing fine (for the last 3  months). However, I feel as though at some point, this is going to get worse ,and I will need to get on predisone. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone on here that is muscular/athletic been on prednisone? Will I still be able to gain muscle? I have heard that it makes you gain weight and grow hair? I already have really thick hair/beard so I don't know how much more hair I would be growing... lol

Any thoughts, advice?",2020-11-28 18:36:39

* Only urgency 3 to 4 times a day.
* During those 3 to 4 times, only once is actual stool.  The other times are mucus and a little blood

Turns out that the doctors office filled out the wrong Entyvio form...so now they have to start the process over on Monday (tomorrow). The infusion center told me it should only take another week... but I’m just tired. I’m tired of feeling sick, tired of hurting, tired of never sleeping because I’m up all night. Tired of feeling like a shitty mother because I don’t have the energy to play with my toddler. 

The part I’m scared about is what if I waited all this time to start Entyvio and then it doesn’t work? Then I have to go through this insurance process all over again to get a different medicine?! 

It’s just so frustrating and exhausting and I want my body to stop aching. I hate to be a complainer... because I know people have it worse/ it could be worse for me.. but I just needed to say all this to people who would understand.

I was diagnosed with pancolitis 10 years ago and had a flare of proctitis earlier this year.

For about two years or so I have been experiencing bad hip pain and lower back pain every time I go for a walk or a run.   I understand that hip pain usually gets worse when moving, whereas back pain gets worse when sitting still.  As my pain is relieved by sitting and gets worse when moving I think it is hip pain radiating to the back. 

My gastro now wants me to see a rheumatologist and thinks it might be arthritis.  I have been tested for  HLA-B27 and it was negative.

Has anyone else experienced this?  

My gastro has suggested switching to sulfasalazine.  Anyone else tried this?

Thanks in advance!",2020-11-30 12:12:53

Tldr; I'm afraid that going to bed instead of the toilet with my diarrhea will result in colitis. Is this possible?

I want to preface by saying that I fo not have Ulcerative Colitis. But about 5 months ago, I had to go to the hospital from what my doctor suspects was bacterial colitis, some people have told me it sounded like acute colitis.

The events of what lead up to me waking up with unimaginable pain in my stomach and blood in my feces seem to be happening tonight. I am having a bout of diarrhea tonight, and my stomach is bloated and uncomfortable, just as it was that night. I guess I'm still traumatized, but I'm so scared right now. I don't want to go through that again. 

My question is, do you think that forcing yourself to go to sleep while you're suffering from diarrhea (instead of letting your body purge everything) result in whatever's causing the diarrhea to grow inside of you and cause a case of colitis?",2020-11-30 07:43:35

I had no symptoms while on it. When I tried to taper off most recently to see if Entyvio was working, my symptoms came back. My GI told me to keep tapering anyway (his exact words were ""we want to see blood and diarrhea,"" I guess my pain wasn't proof enough for him...), so I kept tapering for 3 weeks before I put myself back on daily Uceris. By that point, it was too late. I stayed on it daily for about a month longer, and my symptoms never went back away. I then had a colonoscopy, and afterwards, all hell broke loose and my symptoms got much more severe (severe pain, lots of blood, etc.). I called the on-call GI and he advised me to go to the hospital. I asked won't they just put me on prednisone there and asked if I could just take it at home. He said yes. 

So, I reluctantly (because I have mild osteoporosis from the stuff) put myself on 40 mg of pred that I had leftover from over a year ago. The on-call GI said my GI would follow-up and prescribe me more and give me a taper schedule. Well, my GI (who sucks and I'm seeing a new one soon) refused to give me any and told me ""you can try some prednisone if you want, but it is interchangeable with budesonide."" That's just flat-out not true, but he told me to go back on Uceris, even though it wasn't working any longer because of his horrible advice.

Anyway, I didnt follow his advice this time and stayed on prednisone, using old expired stuff I had. I just went down to 20 mg on Saturday. I'm feeling pretty much back to normal now, but I'm still waiting to get started on Stelara, and so I am hoping I can go back on Uceris while I wait for that to work. I thought maybe it will work again now after a quick pred course. 

So, when should I go back to Uceris? Could I just go back to it when I am supposed to go down to 10 mg pred? My GI was telling me I should go right to Uceris after being on 40 mg pred for 2 weeks with no taper... At that point, I still didn't feel great and did not think that was good advice. 

Any advice? Thanks. I do have a telehealth appointment with a new GI later this week but wanted your opinions.",2020-11-30 02:06:25

I know for sure that one of the following is the reason why I have this disease:

- in my teens I took 7 years in a row antibiotics for my acne. (it is well known that antibiotics harm the gut flora... And 7 years... With antibiotics and no probiotic is a long time.. 

- I took roaccutane for 6 months (a powerful drug for acne.) - in my 20s. (on its side effects.. UC is present) 

- two months before my disease started, I had a surgery for inguinal hernia. I had side effects like clogged blood at the entry points of the paroscope, and fever. I was very scared in that time, and I took antibiotics for the fever. So the side effects, the mental breakdown and fear... Maybe are key elements to trigger this disease...

- my mental health overall... I always see the bad in things... I always expect the worst... I am very logical.. and ""hope"" is at the end on my list...


So one of the above, or all together, triggered my UC.

I go to the bathroom once or twice a day. I’m still gassy and my stomach makes some noises. It’s soft to the touch (I always thought it being hard as a rock was normal!)

My stools vary in consistency though it’s often soft but some form especially on the bottom of the toilet with some flakes. I am also taking high doses of iron which I heard causes looser stools. I had 2 days where I missed the full dose and had a full formed stool. 

Would I be classified as near clinical remission/end of flaring?",2020-09-04 21:59:15

Now imagine You're an invasive biological culture living on the wall of a human large intestine. You are almost perfectly camouflaged, your cell wall closely resembling the cells of you're hosts own cells. You're so well camouflaged that only 1 in 1000 immune systems discover you.  Unfortunately this host is that 1 in 1000. You are quickly erased by white blood cells.

Only after you're gone, your hosts immune systems keeps on fighting. It sees you in every shadow, attacking the cell wall of it's own large intestine that you imitated. It knew that you were different enough to attack you, but after enough cell division, the counter measures made to fight you off cannot differentiate friend from foe.. Just too similar...

Now here's the annoying part. any doctor investigating this doesn't find anything but the immune system attacking itself. The infection has been defeated. no evidence to find in biopsies.

4242,Has anyone needed a portacath?,shinypanters,7,imcji0,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/imcji0/has_anyone_needed_a_portacath/,17,"I've been on Remicade for about a year now, and last week just started up Venofer infusions as well. Not only did the Venofer result in a pretty rough allergic reaction, but I also now have a blood clot and lots of scarring in my arm from all the continuous IV insertions recently.

My left arm has been the only successful place anyone has been able to have luck with for venous access. I'm one of the unfortunate people with little veins that hide and don't like to come near the surface. 

Because of the clot and scarring, I can no longer use that arm for infusions, blood draws, or anything else I often need to get. As a result, my doctor wants to discuss having a port inserted.

Which the idea of really scares me. I'm not good with needles. I've been through Humira injections (also allergic too) and couldn't tolerate it. I've come to terms with IVs eventually, and I'm sure the port will be fine eventually too, but it's going to be another new thing for me and I'm hesitant to be excited about it.

I absolutely understand the necessity of it and I believe in the long run it will help me out. It's a great solution to my predicament, I'm just scared. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any advice or encouragement to help me through this? I've had UC for 14 years now, diagnosed at 13, and it feels like it's always just one thing after another. Every few years my body stops responding to whatever medication I'm on, which eventually led me to the Remicaid. It feels like a lot right now, especially dealing with the blood clot and other actively flaring conditions I have. 

The big thing I want to know is how painful it will be. Both at the time of insertion and then in my every day life. Will I still feel the same pinch of pain/stinging as I would from an IV in my arm when I get my infusions? Will it prevent me from going about my life normally? I just don't know what to expect at all, and that contributes to my fear of it. 

Thank you and I appreciate any help here. It's a hard thing to go through, but it's comforting to know I'm not going through it alone",2020-09-04 10:55:19

After 5 years of random and unpredictable pain, struggle and confusion hitting both me, my dears and the doctors, i can finally say that i'm feeling great!

Don't get me wrong, i'm still on medication, but they are finally working perfectly, and i can finally start planning my life again.
Next week i'm getting hired by a multinational in a warehouse and the next month i'm going back to study for the master degree in aerospace engineer after dropping 3 years ago due to me being both mentally and phisically exhausted.


Here some of the best advices which helped me:

- Most important: not quitting medications, but finding the right and balanced one. This has been crucial to me since mesalamine in general works on me, but the only pills were somehow hurting, so i swapped to topical medication (still mesalamine) and worked great! (It took 2-3 years to figure out..)

- Having someone who doesn't judge, but accept and understands you.

- Making yourself feeling as much comfortable on doing anything as possible and avoid any potential source of stress. I sacrified some friendships for this, i'm not gonna lie.. but it was worth it

- Having a minimum of schedule, not so strict to be considered stressful. This counters that feeling of uncertaincy as well as the anxiety that comes with it.

- Most difficult in my opinion: accepting this disease as part of you, actually considering it as a reason to make you love yourself more than before to be able to get through it and live with it for a not specific amount of time. Btw, working out, healthy food are so underrated: those gave me +13kg, reaching my maximum weight ever!

- Stay positive: while reading these advices it really comes to my mind to say that your state of mind has a lot of influence on this disease.


By posting this, i hope i can cheer up someone who is currently in the middle of the struggle and i wish everyone can feel ok soon!",2020-09-06 19:59:01

It's been almost a year so I'm finally breaking down and at least trying to get the inflammation under control until I find the cause.

I'm new to all of this, not even properly diagnosed yet, but this is my worst fear. 

I went through hair loss years ago and it made me suicidal.

Right now I have been diagnosed by 2 different specialists with crohn's, ulcerative proctitis, GERD, gastritis, or indeterminate inflammatory bowel disease. 

My main symptoms are from my anus / rectum. My inflammation was found in my esophagus, ge junction, stomache, a patch in my cecum and a patch in my rectum.

I know some people will preach to me that getting better is more important than hair, but to me I would rather just end my life than deal with all of this and lose my hair as well.

So far I am prescribed 1000 mg mesalamine suppositories and I was also prescribed a mesalamine enema in May by 2 different drs.

I read the side effects and when I saw hair loss and looked through the subreddits here, on /IBD and /ulcerativecolitis I found so many posts confirming mesalamine causes hair loss.

I'm also not really emptying my bowels anymore, I only pass what needs to come out and them Im done. Urgency has also gone down a bit.

&#x200B;

So im just confused if this is a good or bad thing because if it wasn't for the blood I'd think this recent change is great. Do I just need to give the ulcers sometime to heal before they stop bleeding? I plan on talking to my doc but I am a recently diagnosed patient so i just wanted to see if anyone else has had a similar experience with something like this.",2020-09-07 16:44:13

Ever since I started bleeding and experiencing symptoms back in January, it has not stopped.

Here are the details: 

1. An Alaska roll from a sushi place. This is just a California roll topped with salmon and it’s called something different at other places I’ve been. There are three things that seemed to make a difference, compared to my prior sushi experiences: replace the seaweed used with soy paper. Gluten-free soy sauce on the side. Lastly, request no sesame seeds. I did not consume any wasabi, but I did consume ginger. I was lucky enough to find a place that has the gluten free soy sauce on DoorDash. 

2. A bowl from a Mongolian BBQ place. Now before you scream, it wasn’t actual BBQ. It’s one of those places that lets you pick every ingredient. I had a gluten-free bowl with gluten-free rice noodles, white meat chicken, cabbage, carrots, water chestnuts, and a “gluten free, keto, vegan” ginger sauce. I also got a side of fried rice (yes, this didn’t irritate me). I made a note of no sesame seeds and sauce on the side. 

I don’t even know if gluten messes me up, I just thought better safe than sorry. So anyway, I ate a little, waited, ate some more, waited, and NO BLOOD AND I SLEPT ALMOST A WHOLE NIGHT! I only got up once and it wasn’t bad. Plus I’m on pred so I get up every night anyway. Today I feel great! I bled a couple days ago for the first time in weeks and now I’m back to where I was. 

I will be happy to take questions and sign autographs. Of course, CAVEAT!: YMMV since this disease is so individualistic - but I’m thrilled that not one but TWO foods worked for me, a UC noob in their first flare, and so I wanted to share with my fellow sufferers.

I know it is common to lose hair during flare ups because of deficiencies etc but I was wondering whether any of you have experienced your hair never really recovering since your colitis diagnosis? I was diagnosed in Dec 2018 and have had a couple of flare ups, including one big one in spring/summer 2019. This flare led to me becoming anaemic (ferritin level below 2) and having two iron infusions in Dec 2019 and my hair was very thin during this time. I think my hair began to look a little better after this but it is still thinner than it was pre UC diagnosis, I had a milder, more manageable flare in May which lasted only a couple of weeks and have since been told to take vitamin d which I have been doing since July. Should my hair have recovered now? I am not having any UC symptoms but calprotectin still shows active disease.

I am just wondering whether my hair issue is due to UC/iron deficiency or whether it is another issue which has been hidden by this.

My initial diagnisis, 2.5 years ago, was Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis (26M). My GI doc gave me mesalamine that worked like a charm up until early July. I hadn't questioned the location of my ulcers until this flare, but my new GI doc (I moved) said that UC usually affects the rectum, and in my case it never has. She says, because of that, we cant entirely rule out Crohns.

I've been trying new meds since early August, and found that I am severely allergic to sulfasalazine, but Prednisone has been keeping this flare mostly under control for a week or so. On just Prednisone and a hydrocortisone enema now until my insurance decides whether to cover Entyvio. 

Does everyone here have an affected rectum? Or should I be more convinced that I have Crohns? In either case I guess a bioligic should do the trick, but it would be nice to feel like I know what this is and have some sense of control over it.

Additional details: 

I [23F] was diagnosed with UC about 11 years ago when I was 12. 

The very first time I was admitted I was frighteningly anemic (like, almost dead anemic) and needed an immediate blood transfusion, and my body was under so much stress that I had a stroke, resulting in a blood clot in my brain and about a year and a half of daily blood thinners. 

I'd go through the cycle of meds working, eventually wearing off, going to the hospital from flaring, finding a new medicine that would work for awhile, and then rinse and repeat for about 8 years. 

In 2016, just before my senior year of high school, I opted to go down the surgery route and get a total colectomy done. I knew it was inevitable, and I figured I may as well get it done while I had flexible time (as opposed to not having time when I'd go to college) and while I was healthy. 

It was suppose to be a one step, but a week post op I had complications that resulted in a second surgery and it turning into a two step. I stayed in the hospital for about two months waiting for my intestines to ""wake up"" and start digesting again before going home.  

After my second round of surgery becoming a two step, I had a temporary ostomy bag for three months before going back to get it taken off and have everything reconnected.

I've had 2 colonoscopies, the first one the doctor mentioned I had ulcerative Proctitis as I had some sores, etc. Second colonoscopy a few years later was clean, in that time I was taking Pentasa suppositories. 

I've also had a calprotectin stool test that was normal, and have had some blood tests for inflammation markers which have been ok.

So all of the above has really not to lead to any answers. I can go months and months with normal bowel movements, but then experience a couple months of misery (which I'm in the middle of as we speak).

For me I tend to not have any bowel movements for a couple days but can be gassy, and then, within about 2 or 3 hours I can have 8 or 9 bowel movements, but there is severe urgency to these and if I'm not near a bathroom I'm in trouble as I can't hold it. The stools are anywhere from a 4 to a 7 on the scale, ranging from thin stools to watery nothingness. There is usually also watery blood when wiping but never seems to be in the stools. This cycle can last a few months.

I was hospitalized with a severe ulcerative colitis flare (and C Diff). My GI doctor said I would be either going home or into surgery. After a course of antibiotics, I was given an Inflectra infusion, to which my body thankfully responded (bleeding stopped, frequency and pain of bowel movements was reduced). 

My insurance (United Healthcare) covered pretty much everything for my inpatient visit, since I had already met my out-of-pocket from my colonoscopy back in April. 

2 weeks later I came in to the hospital as an outpatient for my second loading dose of my Inflectra. Apparently, as I’ve recently learned, my insurance has denied this second infusion, so it will cost me about $6,000. Not the end of the world for me, thankfully, but still a lot!

I am wondering if my coverage has anything to do with the way the doctors ordered Inflectra for me. I got a loading dose of Inflectra as an inpatient, but was ultimately discharged without any of the doctors having ordered/set up my next doses.

My GI first started me on 40 mg of prednisone and 2,400 mg of mesalamine. The initial flare died down but when the prednisone taper got down to 15 mg my flare came back. My GI advised me to go back to 40 mg of prednisone and start the taper all over. Long story short every time I taper  down off the prednisone my flare comes back and I don’t want to continue to keep taking prednisone. 

Meanwhile I started Humira a month and half ago, 2,400 mg of mesalamine and 40 mg of prednisone. This time around I was able to taper down to 10 mg of the prednisone but the flare started back up. 

Any of you have the same issue? If so did your medication change (I know it’s different for everyone). I have a GI visit on Monday and want to get some options to discuss with him.

I got my first flare in January of this year and was diagnosed by the gastroenterologist with UC in May but I've never had diahhroea, how common is this?

I definitely had bad proctitis, the gastro saw it during initial examination and I came back with extremely high calprotectin levels from a stool sample. He prescribed me mesalazine suppositories nightly for the month before my colonoscopy, however COVID pushed the procedure back by a month. By that point all symptoms except fatigue and poor sleep had disappeared and my colonoscopy came back clear, no signs.

I went down to using the suppositories every 3 nights and it came back, had the proctitis symptoms return and am back on nightly, now again only symptoms poor sleep and fatigue.

Is it unusual to not have diahhroea as a symptom of UC? 
Even after excessive alcohol or other trigger food/drink consumption I do not have loose stools. 

If anything I almost have constipation in terms of stool firmness, but I'm not blocked up at all, I can have BMs 3+ times a day if I want to but they're not urgent and honestly I can hold them to 2 times a day which I sometimes do coz it just always feels like there's another BM 2 hours after no matter what and I want to avoid pushing/potential hemorrhoids (although I've never had any before).",2020-09-11 02:51:32

- my Doctor did a colonoscopy and diagnosed UC
- he prescribed suppositories and oral meds
- after a period of time it became obvious they weren’t working so he prescribed a biologic (Inflectra) and some immuno surpressant tablets
- Pfeizer (the Inflectra people) called me and got some personal info, my health care number etc, then arranged my infusions
- all set to go; cost was covered by my provincial health care system and by Pfeizer 


Is the process similar in the UK on the NHS? 

Really I am after two things:
- is the process to get going on biologics in the UK as straight forward as it was in Canada, and
- is the cost of biologics covered by the NHS

My mother was diagnosed with UC in 2010 and when they told her, the doctor gave her a list of meds, my mum asked her ""For how months should I take them?"", the doctor laughed at her and told her ""For the rest of your life"". 

My mum was absolutely crushed, which made my father think of other ways that they can deal with it. I am aware that a lot of you guys are sure that meds are the real deal and that doctors know best, but from what I've seen here (I'm from Bulgaria) the doctors only really want to prescribe their meds and get on with their life. 

So my dad started reading a lot of books on the decease and soon after found this doctor, which basically helped my mum. He made her take detailed blood tests, looked at them and made a diet for her, basically showed her what is missing, what is too much and adviced her on how to proceed. I was 14 at the time and it was as if I was not there while all of this was happening, but I specifically remember when my mother started this regime. She had to eat only fresh veggies and fruits and nuts. Two weeks in she was 15kg lighter and I remember her running to the bathroom like every 10 minutes and trying to hide that she was crying. Almost two weeks later she started to eat some of this, some of that, meanwhile her bathroom brakes were gettin fewer and fewer and then they stopped.

One year ago she started having problems again and she is now battling with it. But the thing is, she never took the meds. She got free of it with cleaning her entire body with this diet. I discussed it a lot with her and my dad and I am absolutely sure that the way we eat, the things we eat, the way we cook them is INCREDIBLY important about our well being. Don't rush to meds and don't think that they are the only thing that helps, research for yourself and be open about different approaches.

I hate hippies and I am aware that I probably sound like one :D but I really wanted to share this, since I've joined this sub, cuz I wanted to know more about what my mother is going through once again.

So to cut a long story short. I have been flaring on and off for like 1.5 years now. Entyvio worked for a solid 3 months and after that slight bleeding started again and within 3 weeks it got worse. Like bad urgency, cramps, weightloss (about 11 pounds in approx. 4 weeks), 10x a day times on the toilet and it was dark red. Somehow past week the urgency is not as bad anymore. I'm only going like 4-6 x a day and there is still lots of blood, but not as much as then. I actually scheduled to start Stelara next week... but now I am reconsidering this. Could it be healing itself? I've changed literally nothing.
Should I wait with the Stelara? 
Oh this flare up now has been going on for 2.5 months. 
I am getting this feeling that I should stop with meds, to see what my body is going to do.

PS: Because I have caused some confusion with not being clear in my post, I want to add some of my back story. I do want to state that I have been trying out some supplements since my diagnosis (4 yrs ago). I have been taking curcuma, fish oil, live probiotics and L-Glutamine for a year now.

Do any of you guys have it where sections of your colon feel *sore* at random parts of the day?

It's never really super painful but it's annoying as hell and only makes me more grumpy when I'm already feeling bad.

I would figure that people with Crohn's or people with pancolitis might feel this way, but what throws me off is that my doc told me I only have proctitis and that he didn't find any other chronic inflammation elsewhere in my colon.

He had his second flare in July and has since been losing weight like crazy. I’m trying to make sure he’s getting enough calories and protein, but we work very different schedules and he seems to have an allergy to cooking and feeding himself. He never eats breakfast and only eats lunch half the time. Now that we’re off of the processed foods and preservatives, there isn’t much he’s interested in eating that’s easy for him to make. I thought we could try some meal supplements, but I know liquid shakes have carrageenan in them and that’s bad for UC.

I  (24/m) got diagnosed with ulceritive colitis in February with only about 35cm of my colon affected. Recently I got hospitalised with a major flare and was in hospital for about 3 weeks. I was then diagnosed with pan colitis. I’m currently on azathioprine, Remicade and mesalazine and feeling good and in remission. However I’m very anxious about this whole thing. Every time I feel anything physical my mind goes straight to the worst case scenario. The mental effects are quite rough and I’m interested in hearing how you cope with your diagnosis and the anxiety that follows this disease. I just started therapy and am excited to see how that helps.

I am in a mild flare since beginning of May 2020 and using mesalazine enema and tablet form at the same time. 3g mesalazine from tablets and 4g from enema form. Although enema form of mesalazine (Asacol) works perfect, I started to thing the tablet form is useless (Salofalk). Before this flare, I always get into remission only by using mesalazine tablets, not even enema. So this last flare is different and if I wont use my enemas even for one day, things starts to go back again. That why I started to think tablets are not working properly. I was thinking to try a different type of 5-ASA form but the only available form is Sulfasalazine in my country. Talked with my GI but he didnt recommend to start Sulfasalazine. So I wanna ask, have you guys experienced a difference between sulfasalazine and mesalazine? Which one is more effective?",2020-09-14 20:06:39

I’m already developing cataracts but it’s not supposed to be significant. The real problem is the damage its done to my physiology. I can barely workout without getting injured. I suffer from so many tendon and joint issues since prednisone began. It already sucks that I can’t fully exert myself because of UC rearing its head, but the issues compounded from prednisone make it impossible to really workout. 

I really enjoy lifting and martial arts: 2 things that I can’t do now unless I succumb to plaguing wrist and tendon problems. 

I was never like this prior to prednisone. I used to be able to freely workout without injury, but now injuries are usually a given. I can’t even go on hikes anymore.

4396,One year remission,Dry_Ad8904,18,iu6ing,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/iu6ing/one_year_remission/,5,"I thought I would share my UC story as I just hit the 1 year remission mark (Aug 1) with no physical symptoms or signs of inflammation in my blood or my sigmoidoscopy.  When I was in the thick of my flare-up it was really helpful for me to read the posts and stories on this site and so I'm posting my story in the hope that someone else finds it helpful.  

I was diagnosed in the winter as a 38 year old male after a period of several weeks of non-stop diarrhea.  Truth-be-told i probably had the UC for longer because my bowel movements had been on-and-off problematic for a little while but, the diarrhea would come and go and I never did anything about it.  It wasn't until this one flare up where the diarrhea was non stop, my stomach was hurting, and I noticed that I had to tighten the notch on my pants belt that finally got me to see the doc.  When there they took my weight and I tuned into the fact that I had lost 20 pounds (down to 145 from 165) and realized that I maybe had an issue.  That led to an 8 month period of lots of doctors visits, a colonoscopy, many blood tests, all the while feeling miserable, sleeping poorly and being stressed about the whole thing.  I continued to work throughout.  After the colonoscopy I was diagnosed with pancolitis and recommended by my GI doc that I should start mesalamine.  I was really anxious about the idea of having to get on a medication for life.  I also really wanted to experiment with some non-traditional approaches to dealing my disease as a first step (diet, supplements, meditation, acupuncture, etc...).  I asked my GI doc if I could postpone the start for a small period of time so that I could feel like I had given these other efforts a try.  He recommended against it but noted that, while my colitis spanned my entire colon, it was moderate/mild and relatively stable.  He suggested that if I wanted to do this that I give myself a time period (eg 2-3 months) to try these alternatives and then come back.  He was very clear that he did not think these would work.  So I spent the next 2-3 months trying different things, none of which had any real impact.  Amongst other items, I tried doing a FODMAP diet, taking Curcumin, acupuncture, and meditation.  I came across most of these ideas through limited medical research literature that exists and from sites such as this one.  Finally, feeling no difference, I booked an appointment back with my GI doc resigned to the fact that I would need to start Mesalamine.  Prior to starting this medication my GI doc wanted to run some kidney blood tests which is routine for his clinic because there are some very minimal chances that mesalamine can cause kidney damage.  These results came back and, unfortunately showed high levels of creatinine and other signs of kidney inflammation.  This ultimately led to another 2-3 months of doctors visits, now with a nephrologist, to determine what was going on.  I ended up having a kidney biopsy which showed permanent injury to my kidney which was, thankfully, relatively mild.  Additionally, my most recent blood tests showed my kidney inflammation markers going down and, at the time of the biopsy, there was no ongoing kidney inflammation.  My GI/Neprhologist were both perplexed (they even said, lucky me, that they brought my case to one of their medical grand rounds).  They never could come up with a clear diagnosis but thought that the kidney inflammation, which was no longer present, was likely related to my UC and probably occurring when I was very dehydrated.  While the good news was that the inflammation had stopped, the bad news was that my GI doc did not want to prescribe me on mesalamine anymore and suggested I start an infusion treatment with a different medication (the name of which I currently forget).  I was really disappointed with this news because the new therapy had higher toxicity than mesalamine, was an immunosuppresant, and has slight, but real, increased risk of lymphoma in later life.  When I talked about this with my PCP he acknowledged that I had a really tough options.  I could continue living with my UC untreated, which, while stable very well might get worse, increased my risk of colon cancer, and wasn't great for my quality of life.  Or I could move to the medication which would likely take care of the UC and help my quality of life, but also had some real downsides.

It was about this time that I had also started reading about an ongoing study at Mass General Hospital where intermittent fasting was being used to treat mild UC.  I was reminded of the fact that the only solid poop I had had in the last 8 months was one single time after I had my colonoscopy for which I had to fast in preparation.  I decided to give the intermittent fasting a try (on my own and not through the MGH study) and at the same time scheduled my next appointment with my GI doc.  Believe it or not, by the time I had my next appointment with the GI doc, I was pooping normally again.  In fact, almost immediately after starting this fasting regimen, my poop returned to normal.  As a result of this I decided not to get on the new medication and it's now been 13+ months that I've been in remission, all the while I have continued intermittent fasting.  I have gained back 18 of my 20 pounds lost and feel healthy again.  I originally started with a 14 hour fast and have gradually moved that to 16 hours.  Initially I would eat a late breakfast at 10am and then lunch again a couple of hours later.  Now I simply skip breakfast all together.  While I definitely miss breakfast, it has honestly not been that hard and I can tell you that when I do break my fast, the food is the best I have ever eaten.  I have also kept up my acupuncture throughout as well as start a vitamin d supplement during the winter months.  I do the acupuncture because it reduces my stress.  I don't think it is what put me into remission but I figure it keeps my stress low which is a good thing.  I take vitamin d because there is some limited literature that vitamin d has an impact on the immune system and inflammation and some limited data which suggests that it may help with maintaining remission.  Those are the only things I am doing differently than I was pre-covid, although I am, in general, much more aware of what food goes into my body and how I react to it.  For example, if I have too many carbs (eg beer and pasta) my body reacts poorly.  Similarly, I need to go moderate on the dairy.  

Anyhow, that's my story and I wanted to share it.  I know that I am far from out of the woods and that the UC may flare up again at any time.  I also know that my remission may have nothing to do with my fasting (although I feel strongly that it does).  I also think that it is very important to work closely with your doctor on any actions you take.  I was also very fortunate to have a mild/moderate case of UC.  I have read the posts on this site and know that for many people it is way worse.  I wake up every single day thankful for my health and good fortune I have had.  I also hope I will stay in remission.

I have been prescribed Remicade, Asacol, 5 different pill regimens, Entyvio, Stelara and now about to take my first dose of Xeljanz. In the age of Covid, the increased infection risk is enough to scare an Old Man like me straight, but that isn’t why I’m writing this post. 
In the follow up to the blood tests I had for starting the drug, the doc told me this afternoon that I’m anemic and should take iron supplements with breakfast and dinner.  Their system for call backs kinda sucks, and they will call back tomorrow, but I was surprised by the news and didn’t get to ask much of a follow up question. So, I present it to you my newly found UC Hive Mind.... does that sound like a lot of iron? Can a person be “more anemic” or “less anemic”?  

Anemia explains why I have had dizzy spells several times in the last few weeks, but I just thought it was a side effect of Stelara.  Well, you live and you learn. Do any of you have any recommendations on how to recover pretty quickly from the sorta weak, dizzy feelings with additional diet tips?",2020-09-16 20:18:17

27/M here

I have been very lucky to have been in remission for the past five years and was even able to be taking no medication for the past four years.

(DON'T STOP TAKING MEDS WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR, ALWAYS FOLLOW THEIR ADVICE.)

My last flare was quickly taken care off and very mild.

In the past month, I got into a big, bad flare (25+ toilet visits, very horrible and bloody) so I took myself to the hospital.

I received Mesalazine granules three times a day, Mesalazine enema every night and a dose of cortisone IV and tapering down with pills.

Thankfully, I have responded well in just two weeks, I'm down to 2-3 poops a day and they are formed and virtually bloodless.

After a clean MRI, my doctors have decided to try biologics, I discussed the different options with the specialist here and he recommended Humira as the first port of call as it is the least intrusive and can be self-administered every two weeks. I will come out of the hospital tomorrow, weaker, ten kilos lighter but ready to live healthy again :)

I'm a little nervous to start a new medication, especially because I have responded so well to the Mez and steroids but my specialists say it's about retaining remission and preventing complications in the future so I will follow them.

Wish my luck today!",2020-09-17 11:17:46

At the beginning, i was surprised at how well i reacted to the prednisone as other people were describing side effects that I didn’t get, this week though - my face got all puffy and I didn’t know why. I also found out that i’d been taking 6 pills a day instead of the 5 I was supposed to. I told my mom and she told me it’s fine and to just start taking 5 next week. My mother does this thing where she doesn’t actually look up or get worried about stuff, she just says what makes sense in her head and reccomends it to me - so i asked her “So if i were to google it right now that’s what it’d say?” and then she got upset and changed her answer to “I don’t know I’m not a doctor” She frequently says things like “lots of people live with this” or “the neighbour is more (?) immunocompromised than you and she’s sending her kids to school” (in response to me being upset about her choosing not to switch my sister to the available online school option despite rising cases and outbreaks in schools since they just opened) today she said “you’re 17, you should be able to manage.” but it’s also my second week of university and I feel like it’s not unreasonable for me to be stressed. These things are really hurting my feelings. I cry a few times every day. I just really wish she worried about me. She told me she’d send me to the hospital/mental asylum if i keep having breakdowns the other day - because I screamed after she said she’d put me on anxiety medication... which i found unreasonable because I think my fears of getting covid are rational. Am I really the crazy one? Am I being too needy? I have a therapy appointment coming up which I look forward to. I’m not particularly opposed to anxiety medication should it be found I need them, I just think that this is something that would make anyone upset. Do other people have similar experiences?

I have 20cm more disease than last colonoscopy, and the Asacol does nothing so I'm on Cortenema now. It's been a week and I don't understand why you would even offer an all-night enema to a bowel disease patient. I have bloody diarrhea every 30 minutes as it is. If you look at my stomach wrong I shit myself. How would anyone with proctitis ever use this?

Right now I lay down, which triggers bathroom time for me, so I get up, and go again 4 or 5 times, then try the enema. Getting the tip past angry bloody hemorrhoids, using a phone camera is the hardest part. The bottle is hard as hell to squeeze at that angle even with 2 hands so it takes a few minutes to get it all in. 40 seconds go by, and I spraypaint my bathroom with it, so I take out a second enema and do the process again. 50/50 I can keep the second one in for 30 minutes. It takes me 2 enemas every night instead of 1, they're free, but there must be an easier way, it's taking hours to do this. I'm supposed to do this for a month before seeing the GI.

Long story short, I had little too much to drink last night and when I woke up in the tent I could instantly feel something is about to happen. So to avoid shitting in my sleeping bag next to the others i ran outside. With my feet barely outside the tent the floodgates opened. My boxer was filled to the point it was running down my legs. I only had one choice, to sit down in the freezing river that passed our camp, in broad daylight. Washed myself up and threw away my boxer. But now all I had was a white t-shirt because my stuff was in the tent with the others. So I did what i had to do, wrapped the t-shirt around me like a big diaper and went back in the tent and got my new boxer. At this point they all had woken up and what they saw was a big guy with a red face and a Levis diaper. I didnt say anything and neither did they. But i think they put the pieces together. Also I spent the next couple hours climbing up and down to the place i shit 4 times before we could pack up and leave.

In fact, directly following the first infusion I had very few symptoms-- stools formed, no blood, less mucus. I was flaring for almost 2 years prior to this, with periods of light remission.

However, in the months since, while still far better than before, I've experienced what could be some symptoms. I have really bad urgency in the morning, particularly after breakfast. The urgency also occurs at other periods of the day, but is not as bad.

My stools, while still looking good and fully formed, are thin and the bowel movement take place over an hour. I did have a hemorrhoid a while ago and there is still occasionally some bright red blood after passing a significant amount of stool.

My CRP is low and doctors think I'm in remission. I'm wondering whether the urgency could be due loss of muscle tone in the rectum? Or perhaps it's anxiety induced IBS? Or am I not in remission? Has anybody experienced something similar?",2020-09-20 15:41:35

So just last month I found out I have mild UC. After a year or so of diarrhea which I chalked up to pre-workout side affects, I finally told my doctor and got the colonoscopy done. Up until this week, the only real affect that UC had on me is diarrhea and upset stomach. 

This last week though, I got sick with a virus which flared up my UC. I ended up going to the ER because of sever upper right stomach pain and some blood when I wiped. I had never experienced these symptoms before. By the end of it, I ended up spending two days at the hospital. 

I’m back home now taking Budesonide. Prior to the ER visit, I was on Mesalamine for a month or so but didn’t see any changes at all in my bowel movements. My doctor also wondered if I might’ve been allergic to the Mesalamine. 

I say all this because this is all extremely new to me. I’d be lying if I said I was stressing, which I know can only make the UC worse. Do you guys have any advice or knowledge that you think would be useful for me? Especially as I talk to my doctors and figure out what to do, I’d love all the insight I can get.

When in pain, never be doing nothing. I ALWAYS bring my phone with me in the bathroom so I can divert my attention from pain into music or YouTube. 
2. Make sure you figure out some super basic “safe foods”. This is easier said than done when everyone’s body reacts to food differently, for me it’s chicken, rice, gelatin, and crackers, but knowing what you can eat in a flare is very valuable. 
3. Never hold it in. Get to the bathroom ASAP. I used to be really self conscious about leaving friends hanging at a moments notice because I had to go, but just do it. Explain it them and they’ll understand.
4. Stop eating food that you know will trigger symptoms. Honestly can’t say that I’ve got this one down yet. Every once in a while I eat a cookie or candy or something and regret it immensely later. Sadly I don’t think I’ll ever learn this lesson without experiencing it firsthand many times.

A few years ago my GI told me that where my inflammation was, just the last 12 inches of my colon, it would stay there and likely never advance any further. This time around though, it’s jumped up to the last 4 feet of my colon. 

I’m currently on high dose methylprednisolone, cortiment, hydrocortisone enemas, flagyl, and another antibiotic. All of that combined doesn’t seem to be working. I’m going to get a few rounds of Inflectra. I was on it in the past but had to be taken off for various reasons, and I was switched to Entyvio. That also was stopped after a year. I’m hoping I can somehow be put on Stelara, even though in Canada, you can only get that covered if you have Crohn’s. My brother has Crohn’s and has been in remission since starting Stelara over two years ago. 

So if all of that plus the Inflectra doesn’t work, I’m going to have a total colectomy done. 

What is recovery like after surgery? I worry the most about the pain. I already have extreme pain from my Colitis, but I’m worried that the post op pain will be even worse. Opioids never seem to fully get my pain under control. 

Is living with a Stoma hard? Will I get used to it quickly? I have so many questions and so little time before this may happen. Anything you can say helps.

Finally i start putting all my symptoms together i demanded a colonoscopy but was given a sig flexmoidcosopy the biopsy results came back i was called into the office and told i have ulcerative proctitis. They said it's rare we didn't catch this from the beginning and need to start medication right away so i was taking hydrocortisone cortenema and then suppositories. I ended back in the hospital on July 4th how lucky right for 3 days and he tried to tell me it went away i dont have colitis i knew there was something fishy going on i was taken off the steroids i lost 50lbs some hair and i have severe joint pain now. The dr told me find a new Gi since i don't believe him so i made a follow up appointment and apparently since their in the same medical group wouldn't see me and told me to follow up with northwestern Gi which is best in state.

I was wondering if I could hear some insight into your experience with Calprotectin levels (numbers, accuracy, etc.) 

As a background, my yearly scope in May showed some ""mild inflammation"" which normally it does not, as I have been pretty good at maintaining remission with the exception of a few short flares/c diff issues in the last 3 years . My doctor at the time seemed unconcerned. I've been having some very mild flare symptoms since then (sometimes mucus in tool, some days with stomach pain, all formed stool going about 3-4 times per day) and have recently switched to a new doctor who wants to try and elevate my treatment to make me more stable. 

My test results showed 161 ug/g for Calprotectin, and my WBC was slightly elevated at 10.3 THOU/uL (normal is 10.0). 

Does the Calprotectin result seem like it matches up with my symptoms? I guess I maybe expected it to be slightly lower, but I don't have anything to compare it to so I'm not sure!

I've had appointments with my consultant and 2 stoma nurses who state they have never heard of this but they also gave me a leaflet that said exactly my points in it?!

I feel like this a massive gamble to be taking, especially considering no one can give me an answer? I’m yet to have children and also very much enjoy my sex life.

When I was five I had been admitted to the Texas Children's Hospital so that I could get treated for having blood in my stool. Of the few memories I have, I know that I was there for about a month and then my parents had pulled me out of the hospital once the doctors suggested surgery. After which my parents had taken me to a homeopathic doctor to 'heal' my disease through spiritual means. Surprisingly enough I got better and my parents were completely hooked on spiritual healing and still are to this day. The problem is that my issue didn't go away, up and till now I have had small bouts of gut issues, but nothing too serious until now. Starting about two weeks ago I've been having on and off diarrhea, which worsened to bloody diarrhea about four days ago, and I was admitted to the ER yesterday. At the ER my dad had told the doctor that I had had Ulcerative Colitis when I was younger, and at that point I had never heard of the disease because my parents **never deemed it necessary to tell me**. This is a pretty big surprise to me, as I don't believe in 'spiritual medicine' and whenever I would ask what I had when I was younger my parents would tell me that they didn't know.

Well, at the ER the doctor had told my father and I that I need to see gastrologist (or something I don't recall), so that I can get checked out as soon as possible. The problem is, we don't have health insurance and I haven't had health insurance for about a year and a half. So I would like to ask anybody with knowledge on the subject on what I can do about that. In regards to insurance, I live in the state of Texas and I am 19 years old, I still live with my parents as a dependent, I am not working right now, and my dad the sole worker in the family is relying on unemployment benefits since he was laid off in January.

Any and all input would be appreciated, thank you!",2020-09-22 22:33:00

Honestly, my life wasn’t that bad with UC. I had two hospitalizations in HS, but I adapted to it. I could go to the gym. I could bench 205, deadlift 300. I could ice skate faster than anyone. I slept good, had a good appetite, could eat A TON. I spent a lot of time studying and writing in coffee shops so I’d run to the bathroom a lot, but it was right nearby. Urgency and frequency were the only frustrating things. That and all the bleeding. Sex drive was super high. Mental clarity was fine. I’d get the highest grades in Calc classes. I finished a screenplay last year. Aside from the cramps, I had full mobility and could get comfy. I drank a lot of bone broth, boiled tofu and salmon. Exercise gave me lots of energy, so that countered UC fatigue.

On Jan 1, I moved to Tarpon Springs FL from NYC. I got a job at the mall, signed up for 3 classes at a community college, joined two clubs. I planned to transfer to U Mich for their IBD program since it was super tough in HS, or FSU.

In Jan of this year, the xeljanz was doing nothing, so my GI doc said we could try Stalera. I was taking 40mg of Prednisone starting Jan 31, and was gonna taper down weekly as a bridge until I got to Stalera. On Feb 5, I got the second highest grade on my first Stats exam. Then on Feb 7, I slept 17 hours and had a fever of 103, acute hematoria. I drove myself to the ER. Here’s the thing, I’d get these fevers with the blood in urine and it’d go away on its own within a couple days. So I expect that would have happened this time around. Late that Fri night, I was transferred to Trinity Medical Center where they did a stat surgical consultation. Saturday morning, a colorectal surgeon told me I needed emergency surgery to remove my colon and that the CAT scan showed I’m within hours of a massive deadly perforation. I asked to wait a couple days to think about this, and he said I don’t have a couple days. I find it very suspicious the one time I get a CAT scan in 7 years, I’m gonna die in 2 days? WTF? He pushed me so hard to say yes. I wish he respected my apprehension. I guess when one has a fever like I did, I didn’t have much mental clarity and was just in a gullible spot to be manipulated I guess. I don’t even know who I am anymore given the fact I consented. I mean I said yes that morning of Feb 8 to an emergency colectomy. I betrayed myself. I threw my entire life away by not putting up a fight. Saying no should have been so easy. I’ll never be able to understand why I didn’t just say “no.” The guy was a good salesman. He used fear mongering to get me to say yes as fast as possible. I got duped. His fear tactics worked so well, I didn’t even give much thought to Stalera that morning. I had hours to back out of it, and I didn’t. Accepting my body the way it is feels like an endorsement of evil.

Once the monster got me to say yes. He did the surgery, and my whole life would crumble before me. The man put in the hospital for months. The day after surgery, they transferred me to the ICU. I had a rectal stump blowout. I developed sepsis, peritonitis, kidney failure, lung failure, double pneumonia. I had an NG tube, a bipap machine. Drains coming out of me for 4 months cuz all my organs were soaking in pus. I was throwing up every night. Had to learn to eat and walk again. My mom left her job in Cali to stay with me in the hospital. After 2 months, including being transferred to Tampa General, I had lost 40 lbs since surgery, was dying of starvation and would get TPN at home for 2 more months. I gained my weight back. I just had the first of the two j pouch surgeries at Cedar Sinai in LA 12 days ago. The surgery was 5 hours cuz they spent the first 2 hours just removing scar tissue in my abdomen, abscesses, and adhesions in my small bowel. Back in the hospital cuz I had a small bowel obstruction so some of my bowel is paralised, so back on TPN and potassium and throwing up all day. I have a giant scar from my genitals to sternum, a few inches above my belly button. Still super sore, so walking hurts.

The depression is unreal. The man took my school, job, athletic goals from me. He took everything from me. I mourn my old life. I struggle to fathom how such evil can exist in this world. But Trinity Medical Center embodies that evil. I went into the hospital with a fever that likely would have gone away based on precedent. And that hospital destroyed my body. I feel butchered. I’m taking legal action against the hospital. I’m ordering the medical chart to see what the emergency was. If that doctor told me I wasn’t gonna live 2 days to make a decision, he better have records that suggest cause to give such an ultimatum.

The only thing that makes me feel better is if I tell myself “Stalera would have failed. It would have failed. It would not have given me remission. If I dodged the colectomy in Feb, it only would have been a matter of time before I had the colectomy anyway.” I just gotta keep repeating that to myself. Then I see a Stalera success story from a person who failed everything, and I can’t handle it. It breaks me. I hope Stalera fails them in a year.

I don’t see why I couldn’t just live with the UC forever and keep on trying meds. Surgery was never something I’d consider or entertain, NEVER, but that Feb 8 situation happened so fast. Within hours of never even considering surgery, I ended up getting a colectomy. And ever since that day, Iv’e been in nonstop physical discomfort. My independedce, my skin, mobility, body, my health, my life, my future, my college goals were stolen from me by evil. I need round the clock care by me parents and live with a PICC line so I get antibiotics for a liver abscess.

I was diagnosed with mild UC two years ago in the time since it had been mostly mild (3-5 trips to the bathroom per day, bad days a little blood) until a month ago when I went into a bad flare (10-20 trips per day, mostly blood). I had my colonoscopy and they said that the disease had progressed to pancolitis. They got me on prednisone (60mg) and within a week I was down to one froyo-style (easy, comfortable no blood whatsoever) movement per day. I’m in a bit of a holding pattern when it comes to getting on something in addition to my normal mesalamine regimin as I had a very strange allergy (Alpha Gal) that stops me from using Remicade and a few of the other biologics. The doc said that failing the use of all these drugs one option is colectomy. My current understanding is that there are a few others that won’t trigger my allergy, including Xeljanz, but my GI doc seems reticent to put me on Xeljanz due to the risk of pulmonary embolism. There’s no family history of it and aside from my UC, I’m otherwise a really healthy 40 year old guy. I am sleeping through the night, gaining weight, and feel better than I have since my diagnosis. I know that much of that can be credited to the prednisone and I’ve managed to taper down to 30mg with no issue. In fact the lower dose seems to make the BMs smoother and more dense. I have a couple questions. First, how long is too long on prednisone? If I felt the way I do today for the rest of my life I wouldn’t be sad about it one bit, but I know that’s not an option. I just keep wondering if I can come back to this state of normalcy in the case of a future flare by just asking for prednisone again. My docs don’t seem too concerned and are happy with my taper, but I am curious about y’all’s experience. Second, Xeljanz: how did that go for you? I’ve had one bad flare and while I’m not opposed to a J-pouch in the long term if things don’t get better, the idea of a total colectomy seems extreme in my case, but that’s why I’m posting this, I have no idea of what I’m experiencing is just the prednisone bandaid or perhaps the prednisone is finally lowering the inflammation such that mesalamine can keep me feeling decent.

I'd been struggling with small amounts blood in my stools for just over a year which was meant to have just a been a 'tear' that they had found (it have just been a tear though). Around Easter time my dad came down really ill with covid-19, the standard symptoms. My neighbor also tested positive for covid-19 but had diarrheao/gut pains as his symptoms. ( Maybe Covid-19 set my UC off? )

Then I started having the bad, very bloody diarrhoea and was going upwards of 10/15 times a day for about 3 weeks and obviously with covid-19 it took ages for me to get anywhere with the doctors. I lost a stone and half in those 3 weeks and weighed 9 stone at 5'9. After 4 sets of bloodtests that went nowhere I finally got booked in for a colonoscopy where they diagnosed me with mild-moderate UC and started me on 40 MG Prednisone. I feel like I was already slipping into remission by the time I had my colonoscopy because I was more solid and was only going to the toilet 3/4 times a day with minimal bleeding. Then the Prednisone really knocked me back to normal and I had normal bowel movements with no blood for the rest of my course. I could eat/drink anything I wanted for those 8 weeks. The side effect I noticed was insomia as I wasn't drifting off untill gone 3am for the first 3/4 weeks of the course . Weight gain could have been one of the side effects but feel like it was natural to put weight back on fairly quickly after losing so much. I'm at 10 stone now.

I came off Prednisone 3 weeks ago and I started bleeding heavily/going to the toilet frequently again about 2 weeks ago. I've just just started taking Pentasa ( Mesalazine ) 'to keep me in remission' these last few days but feel like the hospital took too long getting it signed off for me now that it seems like I'm back in flare. I don't wether to get in contact to say I've gone down hill again or wait a few weeks to see how I go with Mesalazine.

I haven't taken it very seriously uptil this point and have been joking about it with it with my mates for most of lockdown. I'd say I'm still in pretty high spirits about it and I came to terms with it being chronic fairly quickly. 'it is what it is' is the attitude I've had towards it but I'm starting to feel like I need to make changes to my diet to help get me back into remission.

It doesn't help that I've started going back to college full time again this week because I don't want to risk testing what sets me off whilst being in college and getting behind on 3 demanding A-levels. I've already cut out seafood because it's never seemed to get on with me and feel like I should be cutting out more e.g. alcohol/spice/dairy?/high fiber food?

I'm worried about the increased risk of bowel cancer with UC and it says online that I should be getting checked for it 10 years after diagnosis. 

What foods set you off so I can try cutting them out?

Well earlier this month, I spent 10 days, in a fly in Stone Sheep hunt in the Mountains of North West BC. 10 days of living off nothing but the back pack full of gear I brought with me including ALL my food (and wet wipes). Obviously the biggest challenge was food. Eating freeze dried back pack meals isn't exactly the diet we need to survive. I packed a LOT of my meals, counting calories and weight, and survived off 2200 calories a day, each days food weighing less than 1 pound 8 ounces of food each.  I also hiked a total of 85kms over 8 of the days I was in the bush. 

Training for this kicked my ass, and I was really nervous, but I came out feeling better than ever. As a matter of fact, some of these super high calorie meals I made might get brought into my regular life style. I had more energy than I could ever imagine.

I’ve been in a flare for the past 11 months with the usual symptoms of blood, between 3-10 BM everyday, cramps, heartburn etc etc etc. Started mesalazine in April and have been slowly getting better since.

In the past month I’ve had no symptoms apart from 2-6 loose BMs a day and a little urgency.

I’ve also put on a lot of weight in the last month, going from 10 stone at my lowest to 11.7 stone now! 

Does this sound like I’m about to enter remission? Is it possible that the number of BMs and urgency I currently have is just because my colon is still in the process of recovering from the flare?

Wanted to walk through my experiences with UC in hopes someone may benefit


I was diagnosed in 2012 at age 23, first year out of university.  It was triggered for what I believed to be 2 reasons.  1) I quit smoking 3 months prior.  2) I was at a time of extreme stress at work.  I in essence was self medicating my stress with cigarettes, and I have found stress to be a primary triggering factor over the years

Things got very bad before I was diagnosed. Was it an ulcer, was it C. difficile?  It took many emerge visits to get the right diagnosis by which point I was ready to keel over, expelling tar every hour.  I barely had the will to even make it to emerge.  

Fortunately I was hospitalized at which point had a specialist assigned to my GI issues. I was put on mezavant and began smoking again and went into remission for about 3 years. 

I quit cigarettes again.... 3 months later.  Flare up. Was assigned Entyvio, and started smoking again.  This successfully kept me in remission for 5 years.  

Once again tried quitting smoking for my health and the future of my family.   3 months into quitting got into an extremely stressful period of work and below are the details I kept for the doctor as a result of this flare

Initial week of flare
Extremely Tender upper right abdomen mosty in gall bladder area but also to left side

Expanded to whole area.   Stool started as green.  Started to form almost a white type muscus layer around it


2nd week
Pain remained significantly uncomfortable went to emerge on the Friday.  CT scan came back with no evident signs of colitis. Recommended buscopan.  Took buscopan for 1 week no apparent improvement.  May have reduced pain a bit. 

3 days later

Blood started to form in stool.  Had some bouts of constipation not greater that 40 hours.  All that would come out would be mucous and blood. 

End of 1 week after emerge 
Saw physician who indicated acute proctitis accompanying the flare up. Had some discomfort in lower rectum. 

Been seeing blood in stool.   Bought packs of smokes and began smoking again. 2 cigarettes in poo started to show sign of improvement.  From 2:00. Saturday to 12:00 Sunday.  Energy wise felt better. I had gotten a formed brown stool with accompanied pain after.  

Although a slight improvement from smoking, never went into full remission.  After a rollercoaster 3 months have been moved into Stelara


Has anyone had experience moving from one biological to another and it’s efficacy?  Ie. Entyvio onto Stelara?

Tried it all, blah blah didn’t work. It hurt to live. Couldn’t eat or sleep, underweight, rules my entire life. I’m going to list some of the soothing approaches I have found, all while considering this is not a one-size-fits-all kind of deal. This is what has helped me, and I hope you might find something that could help you too. Also, I am a doctor, but not an MD. You know, the kind that people dismiss as being “real” doctors (PhD). I’m only saying this so you know I’ve done my research. But obviously I am not giving medical advice.

Diet: I follow an even more restricted form of the FODMAP diet, eliminating all dairy, soy, tough meats, and anything fibrous. Low residue, low fat. I only eat canned veg/fruits aside from bananas. I learned over the years that there is no room for “cheat” days, which will likely steal a week of your life from you. I go through bouts of not eating anything with eggs in it as well (including mayo, baked anything), if I’m feeling especially sick. This has been key. I realized that I wasn’t actually eliminating inflammatory/irritant foods, so my insides could never heal. Took me years to figure this out. Also have to keep eating small amounts even if I feel sick. I’d often go an entire day without eating, but it would restrict movement. So now, if I’m ill, I eat bananas and almond nut thins throughout the day. I do one cup of half decaf half regular caf coffee in the morning, but no more. Eliminated alcohol for the most part, with limited exceptions. All this makes for all work and no fun, but it reached a point where I wasn’t living anyway. Happy to provide more detail on menu if interested. And can we talk about how poisonous ketchup is?! Never realized how much that was messing me up – mostly because of the high fructose corn syrup (but also tomato night shade). Decoded Foods makes a NOTKetchup, that is decent. It’s definitely not ketchup, but it won’t burn your insides. Also took me forever to realize that mustard is full of nightshade spices, so had to eliminate that. No one told me about spices contributing to the Drano effect. 

Pills (or should I say, diet?) 
Mesalamine 4.8GM daily. I learned they potentially were not working because 1. I wasn’t eliminated enough from my diet and 2. I was taking them in the morning with my other pill salad which was upsetting my stomach. I take them after lunch, with food. Colestipol 2GM, helps with stomach acid off label (do not have cholesterol issues), taken in morning. Propranolol 10mg, slows down my anxiety and adrenaline, which does not help the innards. Tylenol for cramping. Occasional Hyoscyamine .375mg for incapacitating cramping. 
 
Supplements: multivitamin, turmeric, fish oil (triple strength), probiotic/prebiotic (twice daily). I’ll second whoever previously mentioned the LiveSpo Colon liquid probiotic supplement. I take these when I have a flare up and seem to recover more quickly. I load up on probiotics whenever something feels off. I space all these out so I’m not loading my stomach with pills at one time. 

Ass pain: I keep baby wipes on hand for all cleaning. I use a combination of naticura alleviate ointment with a prescription lidocaine for hemorrhoids. Squatty potty is a necessity, not just a need. And for those nights where you’re up pacing around, unable to eliminate, with the feeling that a rock will soon burst from your butthole (but still won’t), a 2-quart warm water enema will get it out without straining. Takes some practice to get it all down, but you find your ritual. This has been a life saver for me. You know that warning sensation, where that ring of fire starts, and you know the next 24 hours are about to be ruined? Warm water enema. Get it out before all the straining and blood takes over. 

ALL. THE. WATER. I drink more than I think I need. The blood usually comes back when I’m dehydrated.  And sleep. I had to really address my sleep hygiene because my body could not heal on the sleep schedule and work stress load. Work stress is the same, but I’m very mindful of going to bed early with the right environment for me (temp, darkness, sound). 

I’m not fully in remission, but I can tell when I’m deviating from my routine. My body tells me. Our bodies tell us, and unfortunately its up to us to respond. Kind of like taking care of a toddler, but it’s a disease. “Why are you crying?! You don’t know?! Do you need sleep? Drink? A snack?! I don’t know what you want!” 

Thanks for reading, y’all.",2020-09-28 00:30:21

I'm currently having an active imflamation. Its not that heavy, something like 7 - 10CM of the beginning of my bowel.

I notice that when I'm having an imflamation I am often heavily exausted after meals. It sucks because this is mostly prime time (getting my kids ready for bed). Lots of these times I feel sleepy and I am fighting falling asleep.

I did try to start the fodmap Diet for 3 weeks, but sadly I had to stop due to the imflanation.

Just wondering if you guys have some practical tips to deal with these fatigues. I now try to be active, walking around interact with the kids, but maybe there is more I can try.

Spent a week in the hospital, I was put on antibiotics and IV prednisone, transitioned to pills (starting at 40mg, down 5g a week to taper). Currently on day 2 of 35mg.

I left the hospital feeling great, no pain, no nausea, hydrated, huge appetite. My stools for a few days normalized a bit (had a bit of a shape to them at first, then the rest was mucousy diarrhea). I have been taking my meds religiously (8am every morning for my prednisone, taking my calcium and my vitamin d, finished the antibiotics shortly into the first week). Was taking tylenol round the clock on doctor's recommendation. Fast forward to today and I am the opposite. The past couple of days I have been declining. Woke up this morning with lots of pain, tylenol did absolutely nothing. Nauseous all day, threw up a few times. I took an opioid as prescribed by the doctor earlier today and I am still hurting really badly.

I'm at the point where I am considering going back into the hospital before things hit ""crisis"" again. I am back on a liquid diet as of this morning because of the pain. I have a phone appointment booked for October 5th but I'm getting worse every day. My symptoms are mimicking the day before I went to the ER. 

I was under the impression from my research that prednisone helps bring people out of a flare, however even at 40mg I did okay for a few days and I have been steadily getting worse. 

I guess I just want to know if I'm just not responding to the presnisone? Is that normal? Did anyone else not respond to the prednisone or get worse? Should I go back to the hospital now?

It might be relevant that it took 3 days of IV methylprednisone or whatever it was at 80mg to get my CRP's to even start dropping.

Has anyone else experienced consistent elevations in their liver function test?

I’m not sure if this is the right forum to post in but I honestly didn’t think my chances of many people in skin care forums being on my medication. 

I’ve been diagnosed with UC for 11 years now, have had multiple flare ups & am currently taking 70mg azathioprine (Imuran) which is thankfully keeping me in remission. 

I’ve recently started to get into skin care as the years are catching up on me and I wanted to try “skin needling”, however I just went to check with my GP to make sure that it would be ok with my medication and she told me there was about 1% chance of it causing some pretty severe skin conditions where essentially all the skin on my body could fall off (Steven-Johnson’s syndrome). 
This is kinda terrifying so I’ve tried googling to see if many people who are taking azathioprine have had similar skin treatments and I honestly can’t find anything.

I started taking sulfasalazine as a combo therapy with remicade to try and help my joint pain and I'm about two-ish weeks into taking 500mg three times a day. It's working wonders for my joint pain (it's the best it's been in a LONG time) but I've noticed my legs/ankles/feet are swelling. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this with sulfasalazine or if there could be another explanation.

I'm really hoping for another explanation because I'll be so sad if  I have to come off it since it's the only thing that's worked so far :(",2020-09-29 21:18:14

My primary physician knows of my issues but all she suggested was a clear liquid diet which was only a little beneficial.

I was started on fortnightly injections of humira around 3-4months ago, it started out as the miracle cure for all my woes but I have since been back into flare with loads of side effects and was told to stop. I have been off it for around 3wks now but one of the biggest side effects I was getting was that I simply can't do anything remotely strenuous (lifting heavy things, running, just exerting in any sense of the word) without suffering with pretty extreme aching for days and days afterwards. 

I'm a little worried as to whether there may be something else going on now as it's still happening despite not taking the injections. While playing with my niece the other day I gave her a piggy back, running around and jumping about but three days later my legs are in agony like I've just ran a marathon!

4610,My mom is suffering,oharabk,11,j1ohox,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/j1ohox/my_mom_is_suffering/,11,"Hi everyone, I’m posting this on behalf of my mom, who’s been suffering from UC since May of this year. I’ve been lurking for awhile, and I’ve finally decided to post her experience. Her GI doctors are just telling her to wait for Entyvio to kick in and/or to go to the ER. However, the ER doctors are trying to get her discharged ASAP. They don’t want to deal with her either. She just told me that she feels like everyone just wants her to die. This breaks my heart.

FOR CONTEXT:

She’s 62F, 171, Caucasian. She used to smoke cigarettes for many years, but quit two years ago (I’ve looked into the correlation and the nicotine/UC research and recently had her to start back up with a nicotine vape pen. So far, it doesn’t look like it’s made a difference).  

MAY: My mom started having really bad, WATERY, GREEN, EXPLOSIVE diarrhea (no blood ever) around 60 times a day. Note: Doesn't matter what she eats (or drinks - even water!), it will come right out. In some instances, it comes out in less than an hour. Also, she had a little fecal incontinence, or as she dubs it “leaking”. Her primary care doctor said it was a bug and would go away. Over a week later, she was still sick, and took her to the ER. She was tested positive for a nasty bacteria called Campylobacter, and placed on two courses of IV antibiotics. However, the symptoms did not go away. Eventually, they did a colonoscopy and determined she had Ulcerative Colitis. They put her on high doses of steroids immediately, and eventually, the symptoms subsided. After 2 and a half weeks in the hospital, she was sent home.

JUNE: On the steroids (40 mg of Prednisone), my mom was doing great! She almost seemed back to normal. We went back to the gastro doctor for a follow up to discuss next steps. The plan was simple: Slowly taper her off the Prednisone to see if the symptoms came back. If they did, this was a good sign that she indeed has Ulcerative Colitis and the diarrhea wasn’t from a simple infection. 2 weeks later, the diarrhea came rushing back (now at 20 episodes a day), and because of this, the doctor wanted to officially treat her for Ulcerative Colitis. In the mean time, it was back on the 40mg of prednisone. But it's important to note that the symptoms didn’t subside like they did on that very first round of 40mg Prednisone.

JULY: My mom began several rounds of ENTYVIO. The doctor said that she needed two loading doses, and that when she had the third infusion, it would be like a switch went off, and she should start to feel better. Throughout all the waiting, she's had to go back to the ER and Urgent Care numerous times to get topped off with electrolytes.

AUGUST: She receives her THIRD infusion -- and it seems that there was a little progress. For example, she would always mention that her stomach was very distended and uncomfortable. But that feeling went away. Her ""explosions"" as she called them were less explosive. She started a log on her phone, and I could also see that she was having less episodes per day (now between 5-10). However, she was still having the leaking incontinence. The doctor asked her to taper off of the prednisone one more time and switch to a less potent one (because at this point she was having fatigue and other side effects from the prednisone and it was doing more harm than good).

SEPTEMBER: Things seemed to be getting worse. The amount of episodes increased (between 10-20 a day) and she had SEVERE fatigue (which the doctor said is a side effect from coming off of prednisone). But she couldn’t even walk to the bathroom now without being out of breath. One morning she decided to go for a walk down the hall in her apartment and she shit all over herself, her dress, and the floor (even while wearing dipends). It was humiliating to say the least.

At this point, the doctor did another inflammatory marker test to see if the Entyvio infusions were doing anything. The test came back NORMAL, which meant that the Entyvio was working. So the question is — why is she still having symptoms? The doctor said that it could just take a little longer for the diarrhea to stop. 

Eventually, I had to bring her back to the hospital again (5th time in 5 months), and the doctors discovered that her electrolytes were insanely low. Our nurse says her potassium was the lowest she’s ever seen and was shocked she didn’t have a heart attack. Additionally, it was discovered that she had an enormous blood clot in her right calf. 

They put her on IV steroids again, and eventually switched back to 40mg prednisone which halted the diarrhea. Since then, she’s had her FOURTH Entyvio infusion (she’s now getting them every four weeks) — and we thought she was in the clear! Her stools were starting to form again and she was only having to go one or two times a day versus 10-20. So, once again, the doctor asked us to taper off prednisone. So far so good, until today.

TODAY: She was on 25mg for five days, and today was the day she went down to 20mg. And boom. Just like that — the diarrhea has come RUSHING back. She had 12 bouts of diarrhea within the course of two hours while I was at her place. And she’s had many more since then. We put her back on 25mg, but it doesn’t matter. It’s kind of like once it’s activated, it’s back — doesn’t matter how much prednisone she’s on.

Because of the swelling form the steroids, having to rush back and forth to the bathroom, and being weak from constantly being in and out of the hospital, it’s as if she can’t take care of herself anymore. She can’t cook or clean, and she’s afraid to go anywhere for fear of shitting all over the place. Dipends do not help. The Entyvio doesn’t seem to be stopping the diareah, yet the doctors (because of the inflammatory marker test) say that it’s working! We are both beyond frustrated. 

QUESTIONS:

I’m not sure why I decided to post now. I guess I don’t know what else to do anymore. So, I’m willing to take any and all thoughts at this point — any advice, small tips to give even a bit of relief, words of wisdom, anything. I just ordered her a bidet, so thanks to those who have recommended that. My mom is such a caring person and has spent the past decade taking care of her dying parents and other sick people, and would give away her last dollar if it meant helping someone in need. It would mean the world to give her even a little relief.

One doctor just told me that the diarrhea returning could be a side effect of tapering off the steroids too fast? Almost like a withdrawal symptom. This seems like an excuse just to get me off the phone because I don’t see that side effect listed anywhere online. Have you guys heard of this?

I’ve been reading a lot on here the past couple of months and I see the word “Flare” mentioned a lot. I’m guessing she’s just in a bad flare? Do they last for this long? Do these experiences (frequency, etc) match up with yours? It feels like she’s caught in this cycle — diarrhea depletes electrolytes —> Hospital —> IV steroids/40mg prednisone —> diarrhea stops —> taper off steroids, diarrhea resumes —> hospital. We’ve been through this several times. And it doesn’t matter how many potassium and magnesium pills, or how much gatorade she drinks, the electrolytes WILL get depleted. Even when she’s in the hospital, they can’t keep her at a normal level.",2020-09-29 02:24:46

I am now at a calprotectin level of 101 and am maintaining with mesalamine which never seemed to do much for me in terms of reducing symptoms (at this point still don’t know if it’s helping me stay out of a flare or not but I continue to use the oral and enemas every day/night for peace of mind). My GI who I really liked and trusted is now telling me that I should start Remicade ASAP because 101 is still elevated and I need to get below 50 and maintain below 50 to avoid long term damage. I know he’s the doctor but I have to question whether a calprotectin level of 101 justifies using heavy duty immunosuppressants. I was expecting him to be extremely satisfied with bringing my calprotectin down that low from >1250 during my flare. By the way, my symptoms have been totally under control (knock on wood) since July of 2020. 1-2 bowel movements a day that are formed and no cramping. This is the longest I’ve gone without flaring since my diagnosis in November of 2018.

I was diagnosed with UC in December after experiencing a flare that started in July/August and went until December. I started mesalamine in December and did a prednisone taper and had been fine up until this past week. I now seem to be going through a flare once again (abdominal pain, blood and mucus, little appetite, fatigue). I was supposed to meet with my GI in March and was unable to go to the appointment or reschedule. I have since been calling my GI’s office to schedule an appointment and am always sent to voicemail and have left at least 5 voicemails with no luck. I do not have a GP or else I would reach out to them as well.

Restrictions here are lifting and I admit, it was absolutely so nice to see people. 

After a while, I ended up chatting with some of my husbands friends. I was eating my own food and I noticed that one of the friends had also brought his own food. Being celiac myself, I try to pay attention to other people's food allergies so I can accommodate if possible next time. A few times, it turns out the person has been celiac, so I happily share my own stuff. 

I asked: ""Do you have food allergies? My husband never told me. I can certainly make you something safe for next time!""

Tom, the one who had brought his own food, said that he has really strict food restrictions because he has Crohns. 

Me: ""Oh man. Yeah that's definitely rough. I understand. I have UC myself. Sometimes it's just easier to bring your own food for sure."" 

Tom: ""Okay no, you have no idea how bad it is. Crohns isn't a food allergy. It's an autoimmune disease that is trying to kill me.""

Me: "".... Oh. Well. I guess I don't exactly understand no. Because I don't have Crohns. But I do have ulcerative colitis, which is also autoimmune.""

Tom: ""Crohns is way, way worse. You just have to change your diet and you'll be fine. Mine is autoimmune. Yours is food allergies.""

Me: ""Uh.... they're both autoimmune diseases of the digestive system.""

Tom: ""Yeah well I've been hospitalized for mine so....""

Me: ""Yeah, I spent a week in the hospital for UC before during a bad flare too. They wanted to do surgery and I had to fight them on it.""

Tom: ""Okay wow. Just stop eating what is triggering you, then? Ulcerative Colitis is from food allergies. Man, you really don't understand."" 

Me: ""You know, I think I'm going to go get a drink..."" 

Nobody really knows about my condition, at least not in our wider social circle. I thought it would be a safe place to discuss this kind of thing with a crohnie because we've both fought similar battles. But that was one of the more frustrating interactions I've had. If someone is clueless about the condition, you can kind of understand where they're coming from and the fact they just don't know about the condition. 

Having someone say their condition is worse and gatekeep autoimmune diseases? It was just mindblowing. Instead of an understanding conversation with someone who was fighting the same internal war, it was immediately a pissing match. 

How fucking stupid. Tom *almost* dies of Crohns and it's super super serious. I *almost* die of Ulcerative Colitis and sepsis and it's *my fault* because I don't understand how to manage my *'allergy condition'.* Bro, you serious right now?

Gatekeeping is universal, I guess. What a shame.",2020-06-02 17:50:42

Great news but still have bloating/pain, weird pressure on my bladder, and some rectal pain.  No blood in stool and bowel movements generally normal.

Adding this all up seems like I have a mild but controlled version of UC but concurrently have IBS which is probably causing the symptoms?

 week ago out of nowhere I woke up early in the morning with crippling abdominal pain and urge to empty but nothing came out for a while and as I pushed more I started seeing blood mixed diarrhea come out of me and that continued for the next 5 hours or more . So after feeling that pain and seeing that much blood coming out of my ass for the first time ever I took a visit to a specialist and he told me I will need a colonoscopy to confirm anything but his primary diagnosis is '' some kind of collitis '' , he gave me prescription for pentasa 1mg tablets and told me to schedule for colonoscopy. Now I saw the name of prep is ''eziclen'' and decided to look up on internet and found that the instructions inside says DO NOT take it if I have collitis?? But how does that work ? How I'm supposed to cleanse then? thats my first question.  Now to the next one, he gave me prescription to that pentasa medication but I wonder if I should take it now because if I start taking it before colonoscopy which is not even scheduled yet, the inflammation might go under the radar and I will not be diagnosed? Should I take the meds just yet or wait after colonoscopy ? These questions might be dumb,but better safe than sorry. Thanks in advance",2020-06-03 15:59:34

However the biopsies were inconclusive, suggesting that while it was evident from the tissue sample that the inflammation was chronic, there weren't any identifying features of neither UC nor Crohn's. However, because my symptoms and the pattern of inflammation are pretty much traditional UC, my doctor is assuming for now that it is indeed UC.  

  

So I had almost a year without a flare-up and this was since I cut out fibre from my diet, so I have a very restricted diet but it's manageable. However just over 2 months ago I had suspected covid with the main symptom being extreme vomiting: I was unable to even sip water without throwing it back up within minutes. It was literally one or two days after the vomiting stopped that this flare-up hit, starting as liquid diarrhoea because I had been put on a liquid diet. The diarrhoea is highly atypical for me, here's a description (no pictures but I've spoiler tagged it in case you don't want gross details):  

  

>!Basically this flare-up has different symptoms to normal, specifically the type of diarrhoea I'm having. It's generally large volume and sludge-like, and smells absolutely awful. In previous flare-ups my diarrhoea has been more like what I would say is normal diarrhoea that people with IBS get, 6 on the Bristol stool scale, with the exception of there being blood and also lots of mucus. Obviously these weird sludge-like bowel movements don't really fit anywhere on the Bristol stool scale, and it's weird for me to have diarrhoea with no mucus in particular. Even outside of flare-ups I get a bit of mucus.  !<

  

I am now also finding that wheat makes me very windy which is a big issue because my diet is already so restricted I don't know how I'll be able to eat without having bread. Also I'm starting to worry that I could have coeliac disease as well as UC, because the symptoms that I'm having now do look closer to coeliac disease. Before this recent flare-up I had gone gluten-free before and it didn't really improve anything, on top of that I had been tested for it, so I definitely didn't have coeliac disease then but I'm wondering if it has developed recently.  

  

I'm just so frustrated because I've been waiting for a colonoscopy since December, I finally am having it next week. It was originally delayed to March and then they cancelled it altogether because of covid. After my previous colonoscopy in October my GI put me on mesalazine but that just gave me more diarrhoea so I stopped taking it. She didn't feel comfortable trying anything else without having a firmer diagnosis hence why I have been the whole time without treatment.  

  

Does anyone have any similar experiences with atypical flare-ups etc and what to do? Given that my controlled diet had been working fairly well, I'm really frustrated that it suddenly no longer works. And having to wait so long during a flare-up to even have the chance of treatment is so frustrating too. I wish my GI would just give me some steroids as a temporary solution.",2020-06-04 19:59:59
4682,UC Scoreboard Spreadsheet,eckkky,10,gwkn2y,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/gwkn2y/uc_scoreboard_spreadsheet/,2,"Hi All

So i'm in a University Hospital in France getting treatment and they use a sort of self assessment scoreboard here called Truelove and Witts 'Modified'. Basically they give you a pen and a blank version of the form and once a day you fill it in an it gives you a UC score for the day. It's called the lichtiger score or something. Anything over 10 is considered a severe flare. it's a pretty old system but very useful.

Blank version of the original is [here](https://www.getaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/images_outils_score_lichtiger.pdf).

My new version is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FHHbnUbnDghonjVNFcMQxHIsvxllyodon9TvOoUuhv8/edit?usp=sharing).  Put a date in each column and answer the questions to get your score. Start a new tab for each month.

It's a very useful, quantitative tool, for the doctors who pass every day, to gauge progress - it's main purpose is to see if you are getting better or not.

Since I have been using it I have noticed it is better than the various phone apps for a few reasons.

1. You can fill it in every morning rather than having to remember to do so each time you take a dump. (i run it from 8am to 8am so just take 2 mins every morning)
2. Rather than having an app with a record of every poo you did (or not) you have a score for each day. This makes looking back on your history and progression/regression of your condition a lot easier.

I have spent this morning transposing it into a spreadsheet that calculates the scores for you, based on your responses to the questions. I have translated it as best as possible and tried to make it accurate as poss. it looks ok on a phone too.

I'm getting out tomorrow, if i get hospitalised again, i'll make it better! Anyway if it helps one more person my job is done. Feel free to use/abuse and modify for your own purposes. Don't look at my formulae I know they suck...!

Good luck all.",2020-06-04 18:22:08

I’m 22 years old and was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis 3 years ago. The first year I was taking Lialda which worked initially, but it stopped working after a year and ever since then I have been on Prednisone pretty much constantly (20mg or more). In those two years I have seen a lot of personality changes that I feel are attributed to being on the steroids. Before I started them was my sophomore year of college, which was terrible for me mentally (I was extremely depressed). The following summer was when I started on the Prednisone, and there was a sudden shift in my energy levels and ability to do things, productive things, which made positive changes in my life. Don’t get me wrong, Prednisone is a terrible drug that makes me feel manic and unstable, but at least I was able to harness the energy it gave me and use it for good (mostly). In these past 2 years I have accomplished a lot, and while most of the time I was moody and irritable, at least I made progress in my life as opposed to sitting in my room and doing nothing while feeling apathetic about everything. Essentially I feel like the Prednisone was an antidepressant that I wasn’t even aware I was taking.

Now the situation today. I recently started taking Xeljanz which might be the only drug I’ve taken since Lialda that is keeping my colitis under control. Fingers crossed, as I come off the Prednisone it will stay that way. In 2 weeks I should be off it completely, and as is the case with the last time I tried to come off it (which ended in a hospital stay and a resuming of the steroids), I feel that pre-steroid depressive energy slowly creeping in. So I’m having a bit of an existential crisis. While I really don’t want to be on Prednisone anymore I’m afraid that I’m going to lose whatever that energy was that allowed me to do things with my life and fall back into a deep depression which I was unable to get out of previously. I’m even thinking that the past 2 years of my life have been somewhat of a sham, that I haven’t been myself that whole time, and while I’m grateful to be returning back to normal I kind of don’t really know who I am anymore.

Have any of you experienced this, coming off long-term steroids and realizing just how much they changed you during that time? How did you deal with it? The last thing I want to do is fall back into that dark depression, it is terrible and I don’t think I could handle it especially considering I’ve had a relatively productive 2 years.

I had it done yesterday and was told that I had mild inflammation and the run down I received calls it proctosigmoiditis. She upped my Lialda prescription from 2 to 4 daily.

My doc called in Zofran, but I'm reluctant to take it. For me, it feels like the vomiting starts when whatever is in my intestines gets ""stuck"" in one of two places. Once things start moving and I can poop, the nausea and vomiting (plus racking chills, pouring sweats, and body aches) go away. Unfortunately that can take 24 hours. Zofran, in the past, has not helped when this happens. And since it completely stops my entire digestive system, I think it's a bad idea to take it.

I was prescribed pentasa, 2 pills two times a day (+ some liquid medication that I refused to take bc it was so disgusting that I would actually throw up from it), but tbh I only take my pentasa 30-40% of the time, and when I do, I take only one pill. I’ve gone months without taking it, but I’ve still never had a flare up. I also have t1d, POTS, asthma, and recently, I found out I have mcas. I’ve read that mcas is very common among ppl with IBD, but also, that mcas can be misdiagnosed as IBD. I‘ve had mcas symptoms forever so I think an infection triggered by my mcas would make sense. Ever since I left the hospital, I’ve had a strong feeling that I was misdiagnosed, I can’t really explain it. I have frequent constipation- but that’s pretty common among both POTS and MCAS patients, so that’s unlikely caused by my colitis. 

Occasionally, I’ll run into someone with IBD. They always look super happy & excited to find someone else who understands what they go through. When this happens, I just try to mirror their expressions bc I don’t know what I’m supposed to do or say in that situation. I’ve read a lot about IBD, so I have a good idea of what you guys go through, but I can’t say that I share your experience or that I can truly relate, because for me, it was a one time thing. 

I don’t know the science behind it, so idk if it’s even possible for endoscopy to identify an infection caused by mcas as ulcerative colitis and I’m also new to mcas stuff so if any of you guys also have mcas I’d love to hear from you too :)

Anyways, what do you guys think? Does it sound like I was misdiagnosed to you?",2020-06-08 22:03:33

I'll have a string of good days and then one random bad one. And my first thought is ""hmm, did I eat something weird?"" and then I'll go through my food log and not be able to point to anything in particular right off the bat. Although sometimes I'll identify something I ate 2 days ago or something and wonder if that could be it. But I would guess 2 days ago is an odd time frame, I would expect it to cause problems sooner. I don't know, I'm new to trying to identify troublesome foods and was curious if anyone has any veteran experience for time frames of eating to passing.

\*Also I know we all vary with this. Some folks it will be immediate, others it may be more delayed. I'm open to all replies here, just trying to get a gauge and see if theres a pattern. Thank you!",2020-06-08 20:27:36

4722,No inflammation in colonoscopy?,Quinlov,2,gyydwp,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/gyydwp/no_inflammation_in_colonoscopy/,0,"It's me again (sorry for making so many posts recently) I've just had my colonoscopy and it turns out that I did manage to do the prep properly, thankfully! My anus is very unhappy though :(  

  

My actual question, this time the colonoscopy has said no inflammation (but they did find the lymphoid hyperplasia in my ileum again), the one I had back in October said chronic inflammation in the rectum and sigmoid, and the first colonscopy I had in...May? said that there was nothing wrong at all, but they didn't go all the way to the ileum, and also, it was done in black and white (apparently in the UK they don't have colour cameras yet?) so I'm not sure how much attention I would pay to that one.  

  

Based on the October colonoscopy and my symptoms, my GI gave me a working diagnosis of UC: not a final diagnosis because the biopsies came back ambiguous, concurring that there was chronic inflammation but it was unspecified (I wish they had given a bit more information other than just saying i dunno lol). Obviously the confusion I'm having is that until Saturday I was having severe diarrhoea, and as I had chronic inflammation as of October (when actually I was experiencing mild diarrhoea from time to time, but nothing like what I've had lately) I'm a bit confused as to how it can all appear healthy now. Now, on Saturday I had 1 BM and it was normal (hooray!) and then obviously Sunday was colonoscopy prep so it's impossible to know if that would have been a normal BM or not. But assuming that Saturday could have been the end of the current flare-up, is it possible for that to cause the inflammation to reduce in UC? I'm still fairly convinced that is what it is because of all the blood and mucus and fibre intolerance. What I'm hoping it isn't is another bit of confusing information that doesn't actually lead to a treatment...I would like to stop shitting 8 times a day",2020-06-08 14:27:25

Usually when I go to my GI I pay out of pocket to hear the same thing ""you cant be on the prednisone"" which ok yeah I get that but he never offers any alternative?! And it feels like hes never actually listening to me!! When I say stuff he just either talks over me or will just not respond and start on something else. 

He put me on Lialda about 6 months ago and everytime ive seen him since then Ive told him it doesnt work (it makes me feel worse!) And he just insists on me taking it longer or says ""well you cant be on prednisone"" ive been on and off flaring for the entire year so far and the only reason Ive felt semi normal is because the ER and my primary doctor keep putting me on pred to stop the bleeding. 

I have no clue what to do. I know hes just giving me a runaround because I dont have insurance and thus cant afford any of the meds that would help me (Im allergic to Sulfasalazine) but Ive been flaring for so long and know im going to go in there today and hear the same things.

4724,Mother. Fucking. C diff,marinavtaylor,18,gyvbn5,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/gyvbn5/mother_fucking_c_diff/,8,"This year’s flare is turning into the most frustrating Groundhog Day ever. To a tee I’m dealing with the exact same thing on top of UC as last year, and it seems totally preventable by hospital staff if they weren’t so disjointed in patient care especially for people with IBDs. 

I’ll outline and explain in hopes it helps someone else from having the same thing happen since were all very susceptible to this shit/infections.

1. Go to the hospital because my flare is out of hand, beyond being controlled by just oral steroids. Gets on IV steroids

2. Treated preemptively for sepsis with antibiotics (or some other infection) because I have a mild heart condition that makes me look like I may have an infection (very fast heart rate, sometimes mild fever). Plus we get infections easily especially w taking prednisone. 

3. Tests for infections come back negative after my system is flooded with needless antibiotics.

4. Continued IV steroid treatment. Feeling better within 12-18 hours, discharged shortly after because rectal bleeding stops and they think it’s under control. 

5. Go home, begin bloody diarrhea sometime within 4-6 hours despite continuing oral prednisone. Progressively gets worse throughout the week. Talk to GI, bumps up to 60 (my maximum dose), does literally nothing for the blood. 

6. Wind up back in the hospital, thinking I’m resistant to oral prednisone or something. They collect stool sample. Bam. I test positive for c Diff. 

C Diff presents just like UC and causes urgent, frequent, bloody diarrhea. Last year I thought my maintenance meds weren’t working because I wasn’t getting better. I actually just had c diff. I thought the same thing this time, that maybe I was getting a resistance to steroids. Nope. C diff. The bacteria c diff typically grows after antibiotic use and is very contagious in hospitals. It’s a no brainer I have it again, I’m super pissed at the first drs who sent me home from the hospital, after antibiotics, without a stool test for c diff when I expressed my concern for exactly that (because I went through it last year). And folks, here we are a little over a week later. With c diff. 

Zero clue if this is actually useful or kind of hyper specific to me. If not useful, consider it a rant. I’m just sitting in the hospital wide awake at 4 am with this info and have no one to rant to yet. I’m happy this community exists.",2020-06-08 10:20:53

Before Remicade finally kicked in and showed some positive results. 

I've had my UC well controlled with Remicade for approximately 3.5 years now. When I say ""well controlled"" I mean absolutely zero symptoms or side effects.  The past 6 months or so I've started to notice some joint pain toward the end of my Remicade cycle (ie. symptoms would pop up a week or so before my next scheduled infusion). However, I've had no GI symptoms whatsoever, just Joint pain. 

Well, my doctor suggested I get the Prometheus Anser IFX test the day before my last Infusion. The results just came back and the nurse called and said that it showed the presence of antibodies to the Remicade and that I'm going to need to switch to an alternative treatment. I have an appointment on Friday to discuss with my Doctor.

Has anyone else experienced this? What is the next step after Remicade fails? I thought that remicade was the ""top-tier"" of treatment and it was tough to step down to another medication after Remicade but I'd love to hear your experiences.

Wanted to come on here and ask if anyone can comment on their experience with probiotics during a flare. I am currently flaring with “moderate” symptoms (and am on meds). 

I used to take probiotics regularly while I was in remission last, and for some intuitive reason, stopped while I started flaring. Well, this flares been stubborn to kick (and I am waiting for word from my GI to explore next treatment options) and I’m thinking I might experiment: again, while probiotics seem a little unintuitive during a flare (as you all know, frequency is not really an issue right now) , I am tempted as they could reintroduce good gut bacteria into my system to re-regulate things a bit in slowing them down? I am interested to hear your thoughts.

On the same token, I am wondering about probiotic/fermented foods— I don’t seem to have an issue with dairy, but have been avoiding yogurt as a breakfast option as my appetite is lowest in the morning, when my symptoms are at their worst :-( sauerkraut is tempting as well (Reuben sandwiches were one of my very random, ultimate UC cravings long ago) from the probiotic standpoint, but the amount of roughage is what has deterred me from eating this go-round.

Again, interested to hear your experiences with probiotics— whether it be foods or supplement— and if they helped or made the situation worse.

If you are concerned, if you are scared about your health. Make sure your doctor knows. Do NOT let them push you to the side. This isn't just for UC either.

I just did a colonoscopy in Jan to look at my flare, and now that I’m on meds they wanna look my colon again to make sure the meds are working. Well, my dad is old and had to get a colonoscopy a month ago and was allowed to drink Miralax, and he said it didn’t taste that bad. 

Is it worth asking to change my prep? Golytely makes me wanna vomit the entire time I’m drinking it (I know you guys understand). I’ve tried chilling it, drinking with a straw, mixing it with other things, and taking chasers. Nothing helps. It sucks so hard. 

Are any of you on a different/better tasting prep?",2020-06-10 06:31:08

He said if the tests are correct then we'll have to fight with insurance to put me on entyvio, which I'm ok with. He said ""insurance doesn't like paying for the expensive drugs"" but I'm thinking to myself, my Humira is like $2,600 a week right now. So who knows.

I’m currently on salofalk and my GI suggests that I start E/H soon because I keep having flares on salofalk and my recently stint of prednisone only provided temporary relief. 
I’m worried that:1) my student insurance won’t cover all of it, or that I won’t find a job after I graduate and will therefore have to pay the full amount for a few months, and 2) that it won’t help with fatigue, which is one of my biggest complaints. 
My thought process oscillates between: “I can do anything other people can do, I don’t want to be hindered by this disease” and “I need a fucking nap. Fuck everything”. But I jobs im interesting in are more high-stress, and require you to work long hours. If E/H put me into remission and give me prednisone level energy, I’ll definitely go for it.

After a year and a half of being in pain almost every single day of my freshman year of college, it finally happened. It sucked, i didn’t do very well first semester because of it and sometimes had to cancel last minute on friends. The close ones understood because I eventually told them with it affecting me so much, and i really appreciate them for helping me out when i needed it. I remember being stuck in one of the science building bathrooms feeling like i was going to pass out from the pain crying while texting my mother. i remember having to smoke to physically be able to pack and get on a 7 hour bus ride home one weekend. i had to called my 2 friends who were 3 hours away and cried to them about how i couldn’t deal with it anymore.  i remember the sleepless nights where every few hours i’d have to run down the hall to the bathroom. (god bless my roommate for dealing with that) During one of my finals i studied really hard for, i couldn’t keep my focus bc i was in so much pain. I was out of shape, depressed and tired. also, for the first time in years i managed to catch the flu and was sick on my birthday lmao. 

right before we got sent home after spring break, i started entyvio. its what allowed me to get into remission and i’m eating things (in moderation) that i never could before. i’ve managed to get back into running, slimmed down, was able to focus more on school and managed to get a 4.0 by the end of the second semester. i also don’t have to worry about a fart being a shart anymore :) lmao. hopefully this continues, and i wanna say to everyone who’s struggling, it gets better. it may take a long ass time, but it does. i’m just really thankful to my family and friends (new and old) who have supported me and i know this isn’t the end, but i’m just happy to have reached this point.",2020-06-13 20:22:13

I'm on the melasamine, and I get bleeding somewhat regularly but not all the time.  More commonly I get cramping at night before bed and its been impacting my sleep a lot.  The overall most challenging symptom is fatigue and brain fog.  I can tell my memory isn't functioning nearly as well as usual, and that's a scary, stressful thing.  Anyways, that's my background.

Before a bloody episode, I tend to feel super anxious the day beforehand, and then it gets bad.  Even when I'm not bleeding and in pain, my brain is only working at like 80% capacity.  I work a pretty demanding job at a large tech company, regularly 50-60 hours a week, and it requires my full attention and full cognitive abilities, which just aren't there right now with the fatigue and brain fog.  Ulcerative colitis is stressful enough, but struggling to keep up at work because I can't sleep and feel tired and shitty even when I am rested makes work extremely stressful, which in turn seems to make the ulcerative colitis worse, and it's been spiraling out of control lately.  My super helpful family has told me that the stress is all in my head, so my ulcerative colitis and poor work performance is somehow my fault.  Whatever.

Does anyone have good advice for keeping up at work?  I want to keep my productivity up without getting so stressed I make things worse, and with the fatigue and brain fog and memory difficulties I'm having a hard time.",2020-06-14 22:05:13

Anything out-of-the-ordinary? 

I ask because I gave myself my latest injection (first time) last evening.  It was super easy - went better than I expected.  However, not long after I was very tired and didn't feel all that great - fatigued, sluggish, a general feeling of being uncomfortable.  Now with that said, I also didn't get much sleep the night before (5hrs) and I worked outside in the garden all day doing strenuous work in the heat and sun so it could have just been me feeling spent.  So I'm curious if anyone else has any issues they'd consider the result of taking this med on the day on injection?

Im fine, if this is standard for a back injury but i was worrying this might be AS, and what peoples experiences are with joint pain- is it a binary thing (if you have it, you have full blown AS) or is joint pain part of UC and it can be controlled like UC..

Do colleges have a collective health insurance plan? (We do in Canada)

No meds. Basically, I've become a freakin' vegetarian. I'm basing this from what I've read and watched on this Nutrition Facts site summaries of the latest medical research on the topic of Ulcerative Colitis.

About 18 [ videos and a bunch of blog posts here](https://nutritionfacts.org/?s=ulcerative%20colitis&is_v=1). I'm not proselytizing shit!! Ok, I know everyone has a different situation. Only you can decide what makes sense for you.

For me, I'm looking at this thinking about what my gut microbiome would need based on the medical literature pulled by these folks. I know that information about UC is all over the place, but this site has done the best job unpacking medical studies that I've come across.

**So what am I doing if anyone cares?**

Mostly I'm blending Kale, other veggies, a garlic clove, adding muster powder, flax seeds, frozen berries, unsalted veggie juice, and downing that. The rest is eating whole grains like Sorghum, Oats, rice, and yeah, beans with the occasional slice of bread or small treat. 

There's an app from Nutrition Facts that helps you track quantities and if you're getting enough of everything.

**If someone else goes down the road, get in touch. It would be good to compare notes.**

I mostly think I'm getting better nutrients now but it is a lot of material passing through me. So my next phase of this (waiting for a juicer to arrive) is to do a liquid-only fast for a few days and give my gut a break from physically passing material, which I think is half the problem. I think five days, if I can deal with it.

Basically bone broth, protein shakes (Muscle), water, and cabbage juice and maybe a yogurt or two.

Obviously normal supplements aren't ideal with UC, and it's not so low that I need an infusion. Out of normal range but enough to make me tired and a bit miserable, and probably not optimal for the baby either. I was diagnosed only last September, mild/moderate, hit remission by November and got pregnant in December, so I'm kind of a newbie. No idea what my triggers are or anything like that. I've stayed in remission throughout all 7 months of pregnancy on 1.5g mesalazine so far (apart from very mild symptoms on two separate days), but that could be a pregnancy perk and I don't want to take supplements and risk a flare up. An IBD nurse who works with my local clinic suggested trying a liquid supplement and stopping if symptoms pop up, but I'm nervous. 

Also, if anyone has any suggestions on how to prevent a postpartum flare I would love to hear them! My family are overseas and can't fly to visit due to Covid, and so my husband and I will be on our own after the baby is born.

It’s come and gone. Cleared it by my Pap smear at 25, had it again at 28, not at 31, and two months ago at my yearly pap I had it again. However, the dysplasia has never been bad enough for them to do any surgical procedure - they keep doing the watch and wait approach.

I’m about to start trying the heavier meds since I’m apparently intolerant to all mesalamine and Uceris isn’t making much of a difference for a month now. I’m excited that maybe something will finally put me in remission. This is my first flare after being diagnosed with UC last month, and also have psoriasis and Hashimotos and maybe arthritis or psoriatic arthritis judging by how much my joints have hurt in recent years. So I’m excited that some of these meds apparently also treat those things (except Hashi’s). However, I’m terrified that suppressing my immune system = HPV turns into cervical cancer. 

I see my doctor next week and am coming up with a list of questions to bring in. He gave me a list of meds to consider trying: an immunomodulatory med like azathioprine or 6 mercaptopurine along with a biological agent (Humira, Remicade, Cimzia, Entyvio, or Xeljanz). 

Anyone have experience with this? The prospect of HPV getting worse scares me. Ive always been told HPV is super common and usually your immune system clears it so they haven’t done anything, but it’s been persistent! Im asking here because I don’t know how much experience a GI doc will have with stuff like HPV. Thanks guys.",2020-06-19 18:06:15

Now, as things are going back to normal i wanted to look for a job. The problem is,ever since last month I started to decline. My stools are very loose, light in color, take 30 minutes at minimum to pass and come with pain. No blood, but you know. It's not healthy, or orderly or something that you can fit into your daily schedule. I don't feel safe leaving my house knowing one of these csn come at any time.

My last upkeep induction was 2 weeks ago where I told this. Dr said we might need to up the dose, so i'd get it every 4 weeks. That calmed me down, but 2 weeks has passed since my last induction. I *should* be okay. It still should be active in my system. Then why were there no improvements? I'm starting to panic. I was promised years of living as a normal person and i'm back again at feeling helpless.

Could it be that I already formed antibodies? Is that a specific test i should inquire about or is it in the regular bloodwork they have you do before the induction?

I have been on Humira since October of 2018. I started with biweekly injections, and saw little improvement, and in October 2019 after having my Humira levels tested (which were the bare minimum) we increased dosage to weekly injections. The last 3 months I have seen significant improvement. I am having relatively regular bowel schedules, I no longer have any sign of rectal bleeding (this was my worst symptom with significant loss), which also means I am no longer anemic. I am able to FART like a human (not ashamed to admit this is my new favorite activity). My joints are constantly sore, but this is the least of my worries with so many improvements.

With general illness, and now especially with Covid, I do not want to stay on biologics longer than necessary. I did know someone personally who was immunosuppressed, caught a cold that wouldn't pass and after a few days he went to the ER, was diagnosed with pneumonia, and dead a few hours later. I do not take this risk lightly, and I do not want to live my life in fear of catching anything. 

For anyone who has weaned off the biologics; what was this process like? How long were you on them; how long did you wait after achieving remission to discontinue use; did you end up back on them; did you supplement with something else for maintenance? 

I understand that my GI will help me make these decisions, and it is a conversation we will have. I also prefer to hear the experience from those who have to live with this disease. I value these experience opinions more than that coming from my physician who doesn't live with this disease, but merely treats textbook symptoms.",2020-06-24 21:07:56

When I last spoke to my Gastro he said that Azathioprine would bd the next step but was reluctant to prescribe it at the time - this was due to the immunosupressing element of it and how prevelant COVID was when we had the consultation. 

Given that the COVID threat has somewhat lessened, I'm anticipating moving on to it soon when I next speak to him. **I'm keen to hear from anyone who was on Mesalazine for a while and then had symptoms that meant it was worth taking that next step in terms of the severity of the medication.**

Flaring since January and diagnosed with left-sided UC last month, the worst part starting at 32cm (about a foot) above rectum. Some other parts of the colon have inflammation, but he said it “isn’t characteristic of UC” and could be from something as simple as the prep. So far I’ve tried:

* Uceris/Budesonise - for a month so far. No real changes that I can tell, perhaps a very mild one - just bone pain and my period started today, a week late. Period was normal before this, even when I was flaring worse. He said it’s apparently not very specific to my GI tract if I’m also having these issues. 

* Mesalamine - FAILED. Tried 1.2gm, 750mg balsalazide and 0.375gm Apriso and every time, I got this massive pressure headache that didn’t go away until it wore off, despite being fully hydrated. Apparently this happens in 7-10% of people. UGH. 

In our last visit, he wants to put me on Entyvio. The things complicating this: (1) I have high-risk HPV (see my previous post), so it’s important I try something GI-specific to lessen the chance it turns into cervical cancer, and (2) I got laid off in January, and I’m still too sick to work even remotely, so the price tag scares me, and I know you can form antibodies if you quit. I’m paying out of my life savings for COBRA right now and that can only last so long. So I wanna try everything possible before resorting to that. 😣

Last night, I tried a hydrocortisone enema aka Cortenema he prescribed me. 

This morning.. I woke up and didn’t have to immediately go to the bathroom for the first time all year. WHAT?!?!! When I did go, it was just the enema stuff from last night and a small bit of blood. 

So I decided to be brave and eat breakfast. I went after that, but again more enema residue and a very small amount of blood/mucus. NO cramping. Very little urgency. 🥳🎂🍾💫🎈🎁

Is this too good to be true?!!!!??

I searched this subreddit and only found two prior posts about it. I know you can’t stay on it forever. Will it last? Could I avoid starting Entyvio? Probably not, right? 😔

Also, does anyone know if any of the other biologics are specific to the GI tract like Entyvio rather than systemic? If that’s the only one, I’m in trouble. It seems like others here only take it for a couple years before it’s not working anymore, if that.",2020-06-26 17:47:08

As you can imagine, it has impacted my life significantly and I now have more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression as well. I regularly feel like I can't do the work I'm supposed to do because of that fatigue. My body and brain can't get themselves to get to work anymore. I'm trying to exercise but the fatigue afterwards is so much worse than before that it makes me not want to exercise at all. 

I mentioned it to my gastroenterologist at my last colonoscopy a few weeks ago and he said that fatigue could be recurrent in UC patients in remission, but he hasn't mentioned any treatment or ways to manage it :-/

I was wondering if anyone else from this group had experienced this. If so, what do you do to manage the fatigue?",2020-06-26 04:37:52

So a little backstory is that I was diagnosed with UC about 4 months ago. I was prescribed prednisone but felt like going the natural route. The natural route somewhat worked but I occasionally get pain still and wanted to see a new GI doctor since the previous one and I didn’t get along very well. 

The new GI says “pain isn’t a typical symptom of UC. Usually there is rectal bleeding, and soft stool but not pain.” And tat pain is usually a symptom of something else. Possibly Crohn’s. He wants to do an endoscopy to see also if I have any ulcers on the opposite end since they already did a colonoscopy at my previous GI. What should I do here? The GI has been in practice for awhile and this is the first time hearing about this, and I know I def had a lot of pain with my UC, but he says it’s something else. Is he BSing me? Should I do the endoscopy?  

He also (I don’t know what it’s called) but basically stuck his finger up my rear end to check for any blood and he said there was none. Not even microscopic. So there’s no flare up he says. 

But the pain is still there for me. I usually have fully formed stools but this morning I had really loose stool and bad pain and I’m getting very scared. I may have to just take the medication perhaps and get a host of crazy side effects that I’m not prepared to handle.",2020-06-27 11:57:12

I got so surprised and so moved by this woman, i didn't even know her and yet she was so kind and generous, thats when I burst into tears, i have only saw my dad cried once when my grandmother passed away but on that day I saw him cry when that kind woman closed the door.

I still think that she was a message of hope, she entered when i was in my lowest and truly hopeless, she was truly an angel of kindness and hope. I dont know where she is but i wish her to be fine.

I feel like I should give up food to heal. Have you ever been there? What did you do?

Hi, all. 

I love this community. We're so supportive of one another. And while most of us aren't doctors, we have a breadth of firsthand experience to share. I'm hoping someone has been somewhere similar to where I am now, and can offer me some guidance. 

I'm in the middle of the worst flare-up of my life. It began about 7 months ago, and it's gotten better and worse--better mostly thanks for courses of Prednisone. Well, I've been off Prednisone for about a month now, and my GI doc has me on an immunosuppressant called Xeljanz. They say it takes 4-8 weeks to show results. I'm on week 4 of Xeljanz, and while the UC deeper in my colon seems to be doing well (well formed stools) I've got terrible Proctitis inflammation just past my rectum. I've been trying to treat the rectal inflammation with Hydrocortisone enemas with limited success. Passing stool hurts so bad that I'm to the point where I'm ready to give up eating entirely--as hard as that is. In fact, I've been limiting my meals to dinner. As a result, my weight and energy are slowly ticking down. I've got constipation--or something like it. My rectum is so inflamed that stool does not want to come out. To help pass stool, I've tried to ensure I'm getting enough fiber with my meals, either with Metamucil or having a high fiber meal like quinoa. 

Tonight after dinner, I had a poo and afterwards my butt was in so much pain I was contemplating going to the ER hoping for pain killers--the last thing any immunocompromised person wants to do in the era of Covid-19! I've noticed between poops, my butt doesn't hurt or bleed so bad. But after I poop, it's like the stool is literally ripping open sores on the walls of my colon as it exits. I sometimes see blood clots floating on the surface of the toilet water after going. It's frustrating, because I want to eat to keep my energy and weight up, but I want to heal too. And it's like I can't do both.

Has anyone else ever felt like they had to choose between eating/pooping and healing? What did you do?",2020-06-27 08:18:12

Got diagnosed in April  with the symptoms of blood on toilet paper, streaking in feces, bloated, mucus and pus, and going to the bathroom multiple times a day. I didnt (still dont) have insurance so I went online and research discounted colonoscopies. Found colonoscopyassist.com and got an appt. Was diagnosed 2 months ago and was prescribed mesalamine enema. Blood in stool went away like a snap. Changed my diet and I only went to pass a bowel movement everyday day to every other day.

 But now after 2 months on mesalamine blood is starting to show back up in my bowel movements and it's such a huge hit in the gut (literally). And on top of that, a few days ago my work told me that even though I was furloughed, now they have to lay me off. I tried to apply for medicaid but was denied because I made too much on unemployment. Going to end my unemployment next week and reapply (wish me luck, I hope they accept people with no job). I can barely stick to my diet (which is no dairy, no gluten and nothing exciting) because I'm so stressed and upset. I also am so exhausted all the time no matter how much sleep I get...I have no desire to workout so I walk my dog for 15 minutes everyday at least. So far I have lost 15 pounds (luckily I had weight to lose) and even though I'll have a big meal I still lose weight. 

I start my final year of nursing school in august, and i can already feel the 24/7 stress coming... which doesn't help flares... anyway I just needed to vent, thanks for listening.

*edit: I also want to say that I may look into being an IBD nurse or a GI nurse when i graduate to help people like us so they dont feel alone and have someone understand what they're going through while they are being taken care of.",2020-06-28 20:39:46

Mine included. 

During a flare, working from home would have been a dream as it would have significantly reduced the toll in dealing with work stresses and trying to manage active UC as well as my unpaid time off. 

Now I am not in remission, but heavily controlled by medication and dealing with some lovely side effects. Our company is in talks of permanent working from home position and it's got me thinking if this would be a good move for the longer term and whether or not to apply.

My job is boring, there is no two ways about it, it is down right dull and repetitive. What gets me through the day is the people and I would sacrifice that working from home. Though the upside, I get a lot more time with my newborn which has been lovely as I have seen so many milestones I would have otherwise missed.

My typical day involves being very fatigued, often crippling anxiety trying to hide UC and the many bathroom trips (as well as make the work commute in time!)  and I feel working from home would be a huge weight relief in this instance. 

In a world now where I am classed as vulnerable and there are no public toilets open in supermarkets or usual places, I have pretty much avoided going out in general now so kind of use to it.

I've been on entyvio for the past 2 years and during that time i've also vaped weed daily. I've not had a single flare up since I started using entyvio and using cannabis daily and as of the last tests for the past 8-9 months, there are zero signs of inflammation in my stool.  


But for the past half year or so I've been dealing with problems like congestion daily (consistently at night when im laying down), sticky and increased mucus production, joint pain, and unusual fatigue, increased blood pressure and sometimes a feeling of tightness in chest due to the blood pressure I assume. Most if not all of these seem more prevalent the first few weeks after my entyvio infusion.  


I've went to doctors related to all these symptoms but with no avail, and it wasn't until recently I considered it could be the entyvio causing most of these, after reading up on the possible side effects on it. In the past, I would feel my symptoms creep up on me usually a week before my next treatment, but ever since I started using cannabis daily, I feel no different even right up till the treatment (which has also increased to a 9 week interval). I'm considering taking all this to my doctor and hopefully slowly tap down on the entyvio I get and eventually try without.

 And if anyone here is in a position to try cannabis to help with symptoms, i strongly recommend it. Even if it isnt viable as a sole treatment, it has helped increase my appetite and completely remove my usual symptoms of the disease.",2020-07-01 00:33:51

Currently on entyvio but also being out on uceris and azaprionine too.

I hope this is okay and maybe get some advice from y'all..

I was diagnosed with UC officially just yesterday from a university doctor. The other 2 docs I saw first said Crohn's second said colitis.

Regardless my family andnothers are driving me crazy. My mom just won't stop with the notion that it's diet related or a better diet can help me. All 3 docs say it's not diet related at all but they insist. My grandma thinks doctors are quacks and it's herbal.

My mother in law insists I must have FMLA paperwork ready at work just incase, which makes absolutely no sense because how can you have that type of thing ready for an unknown flare-up?? 

I've had it with the diet and the people saying oh be careful with all these immunosuppressants you're on and you want to be careful blah blah blah.

Like I don't already know!!!! 

And on top of it, I could eat what people consider healthy, like greens and stuff and I'd be dead from suffering but I eat crap fast food and feel fine. 

Any advice? I am trying not to lose my temper with this. Only one who understands seems to be my wife thank god.

5020,The effect of stress,chacharella,44,hiq188,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/hiq188/the_effect_of_stress/,27,"This is purely anecdotal evidence, but I've heard others speak similarly. Just wanted to share my concrete discovery. It is a bit cathartic to write all this out in one place too. 

A year and a half ago, I took a job that wasn't exactly in line with my career plan. I was concerned about finding a job quickly in order to make the move to a new city as smooth as possible for my family. Plus, I figured if it didn't work out, that's fine, the job market for the new city was very good for the kind of jobs I knew I wanted. 

I had great teammates and bosses, for the most part, but the job itself was a mess. I was constantly stressed out despite many attempts to improve things. I eventually started seeing a therapist and was diagnosed with clinical depression and started to learn coping skills. Also had a great psychiatrist who worked with my family history and disease knowledge to prescribe me Wellbutrin (I read about this drug in Brigg's Protocol).

All the while, my bathroom situation was not great. My BMs were all over the place and I couldn't control the urgency, even when I knew I wasn't ready for a BM (lots of mucous deposits and blood-tinged sharts). I had heard stress was a factor in the disease but I wasn't going to let myself off that easy--*obviously* I was doing something else wrong as well, like not eating the right foods! My preoccupation with diet almost certainly created a vicious cycle in my stress and bowel management. I even started seeing a nutritionist, which was a very educational experience, but this unfortunately came to a halt with COVID closing of the office. 

I am 99% sure now that stress was the majority of the issue. Why? Well, I quit the stressful job two weeks ago and I haven't had a loose BM since. I only make 3-4 visits to the bathroom now instead of my usual 5-10 trips. The difference is amazing. The last time my BMs were this good was when I was on Remicade! The only thing I take now is a routine RX for Lialda. The only foods I avoid are high lactose and gluten, because I can clearly see now (without stress symptoms clouding things) that those are my primary culprits for IBS.

Now I'm looking at grad school again (put that on pause when we decided to move cities), have a close friend I met though a depression therapy group, got a dog for the first time in my life, have a promising new job and less guilt for the things I eat.

TL;DR of sorts:
I know there's many different experiences and backgrounds under this giant umbrella of a diagnosis called Ulcerative Colitis, but if I had one takeaway advice for others it would be this: focus on a way to manage your stress FIRST, then tackle the other stuff. 

I'll add just one more bit to the story here and say that my very first flare was two months after having my first baby. I was overwhelmed, the support I had wasn't much (or so I thought) and my body had just gone through a ton of change. I believe now that if I had not put so much on myself and acknowledged my limits that I would have avoided triggering the flare.",2020-06-30 17:56:33

I suffer from hidradenitis supprativa II and also from undiagnosed stomach pains. I have a high suspicion of UC or Crohn's and have been trying to get diagnosed for my whole life with no luck.

I've done a plethora of my own research and took many biology and medical courses in college to try and understand my own problems better.

From my own findings and research, I have developed the following theory:

Due to the nature of the epithelial tissue on the outside of the body being so similar to the epithelial tissue that lines the digestive tract, I believe that whatever issues affects my skin also affects my digestive system.

I believe that hidradenitis supprativa causes the skin to heal incorrectly and cause ""tunneling"" or the formation of sinus tracts in the body that can hold onto bacteria and cause cystic infections and dramatic inflammatory immune system responses, resulting in the painful skin flare-ups. I believe this same sinus tracts formation is happening in the epithelial lining of the digestive tract.

I also think that when the inner cystic sacs from these flare-ups are broken from trauma (think trying to pop a pimple and it pops on the inside instead of through the top layer of skin) then tunnels form beneath the skin, aggregating the disease.

I also suffer from a rare congenital defect called a branchial cleft cyst, where a small sinus track on my neck from remains open stemming from being an embryo and having fetal neck folds.

I have a theory that maybe these three conditions, hidradenitis, IBD disorders, and branchial cleft cycsts, might have some sort of correlation because I believe they all deal with improper healing/closing of sinus tracts.

I have not been able to find any documentation Linking branchial cleft cycsts to any other disorders, so I decided to make this poll and see if anyone else has experienced these three conditions together in hopes that more individuals can be diagnosed properly.

Maybe the presence of branchial cleft cycsts and hidradenitis can help diagnose people's stomach pains too

Thanks for your participation!!

IMPORTANT NOTE: my branchial cleft cycst is not actually a cyst but just a hole in my neck that leaks clear mucus, they do not always present as a cyst but may just present as a sinus track much like HS tracks appear in remission state.

Tl;dr: I think hidradenitis supprativa branchial cleft cycsts and IBD issues may be related, but there is no research in this, so I'm reaching out to you all to conduct some research myself.

My doctor said it’s the UC attacking my joints. I would like to know scientifically what that actually means. My bones? Tendons? They did an XRay and it all came back normal. 

No way this is regular rheumatoid arthritis?! 
Thankfully I know it will get better once my flare up does. But I can’t find much on the internet explaining what’s actually happening. All I read is that arthritis is a side effect of UC...yes yes I got that. I want to know what’s going on inside my joints!! They don’t look swollen or red

Before I was even diagnosed (7/2019) I was already feeling signs of depression. With UC on top of all this shit I'm dealing with already I feel like I've been pushed over the edge. Life just doesn't feel worth living at the current moment. I know I'm probably overreacting considering that I have a relatively mild case of UC but my god is the uncertainty of my future really something that's got me feeling paralyzed mentally. Dealing with the fatigue from this condition really doesn't help either when all I feel able to do is come home from work and just sit in front of my computer for the rest of the day and play or watch video games.  

Even though I was already depressed before UC, I still had hopes of a bright future, and that was what kept me going in life. But UC makes my future worse, and therefore I have less to keep me going in life. Prior to all this I was a straight-A student in university studying Computer Science with aspirations of being a software engineer (probably one of the best career paths for us UC'ers!). I had four semesters left before graduation, however because of how disruptive my condition was, I had to take this semester off. I'm still working part-time as an assistant at my school and that does help me a bit mentally.  

But now I don't even know when I'll return to university because of my UC and my depression. Yes, I can be in a remission soon, but I'm still learning how this condition affects me and how often I will flare up. I can't afford to flare up in the middle of the semester while taking a full workload of intense courses otherwise my financial aid will be dropped, and I certainly can't afford to attend school if that ends up happening (part-time isn't an option, neither is online school). It just feels like I'm stuck in life and it's not a good feeling. I never wanted to be the stereotypical 20-something year old who just plays video games in their mother's basement. I wanted to succeed in life, and go the extra mile to deliver excellence in all things that I do. Well here I am at 22, playing video games in their mother's basement, because I don't have the will or the energy to do anything else.  

I do recognize that this is a phase, and it will pass with the aid of my psychologist, and I'll be back up on my feet feeling like my old self. It's a matter of when. Could be months, perhaps years. But I'm really starting to get worn out about having to feel like this. It fucking sucks.",2019-10-05 06:42:03

A year ago my son was diagnosed with IBS after suffering from frequent reflux and “constipated diarrhea” as he called it. We did a bunch of stool samples and bloodwork and everything came back “normal”. He was prescribed Levsin, and we saw improvement.

Flash forward to this summer when he started needing to use the restroom during meals or immediately after. Then he started having urgency and no stool, only mucus, then blood in the mucus. ER visit due to pain and blood, end up admitted for 4 days, He had upper and lower scopes while admitted and we are currently waiting on his biopsy results. Scopes look gorgeous except for mild localized inflammation in the rectum.  He has the sense of urgency, but mostly only passes gas (loud) and mucus and has constant belly pain ranging from 6-8. Was sent home with Canasa and Bentyl, symptoms are not improving yet. He spends 10-20+ minutes of every waking hour on the toilet, and is woken up typically 2-3 times a night. 

I pulled diary and gluten and am feeding him low inflammation foods while we are waiting for results. This is severely limiting his ability to participate in normal activities, and I just feel awful that I can’t help him feel better.

I had to be hospitalized because the pain got rly bad, but after I took the mesalamine medication (canasa and lialda), I felt much better.  I used to poop only once a day, but now I go about 3 times a day, but I dont feel pain and moderate bleeding only happens if I dont put the enema for more than 2 days.  My doctor says it’s good that I’ve reacted to the mesalamine, but I’m really worried that it’ll get worse.  Looking at all these posts here, I’m so grateful that my UC seems mild, but I’m scared I’ll be debilitated in the long run.  Do you guys know if mild UC lasts?  Is it possible that my body will stop reacting to the mesalamine, and the auto-immune attack will get stronger?  Also, if I dont feel pain and my bleeding is mild-none as long as I take the mesalamine, does that mean my colon is doing fine?  Or is it possible that it’s slowly getting inflamed?  I’m rly sorry for all these questions it’s just the gravity of the situation has rly dawned on me this past month, my daughter was just born and I want to be there to watch her grow up without struggling so much.  I just dont want it to get to a point where I’m harshly debilitated, I’m rly sorry for all who have to deal with severe UC.

I spent all of 2018 suffering cause I was embarrassed of what was going on with my body so I hid it until I couldn't anymore. I spent a couple of trips to the Dr before getting referred to a GI. October 11,2018 was when I got the official diagnosis...

I feel like I got lucky with how quickly I got my UC under control. I read so many stories of people being in flares for months or years and yet, I was able to get mine under control with steroids and a couple attempts at different medications.  But I thought I share a little more of my story.

At the time of dx I had experienced 5 funerals for my family, full time college student at a part time job and working full time hours at said job. I was under a lot of stress and dealing with it all on my own. I live with my family but they had no idea how stressed I actually was. My boyfriend was my main support throughout all of it. I didn't actually notice an improvement in my health until I started seeing a counselor at the college. She was amazing in helping me figure out how to calm down and control my anxiety. I saw her for two months before I graduated with my AAT. 

Here I am, almost a year later at 20 almost 21 double majoring in EC and EE for my bachelor's degree, living mostly pain free (joint pain sucks), and eating with very few bm issues. 

It's amazing how little things can make a big difference. I feel like my story compared to others, is completely different than most from what I've read. I feel guilty for how well I'm doing and how quickly I've gotten to this better me. But I'm also proud of where I'm at and how far I've come. I'm just curious if anyone else feels ""guilty"" about their situation when looking at other stories and what do you do to not feel ""guilty""?",2019-10-09 04:13:16

I just got so sick of being in pain and shitting myself at work that I finally started Remicade last week. Waiting to see how it workd. I still wonder if there is an environmental cause out there, or if I have a clandestine parasite or infection, but in the meantime I wanted a normal life again. To be honest I feel somewhat weak-willed for not sticking to diets better, for not eliminating stressors better.

I just wanted to check in and put a cpl things out there and off my mind . 

Since 2012 I have had a flare up every year like clockwork . It seemed that when the Masters were on TV in early April I would be coming out of a flare . Out of the hospital . Dadada . All that usually spanned 2-3 months a clip .

These past two years however I have been getting them in the fall too . Oct. 7th two years ago and last years early on in November . These flares don’t end for months until I tap out and go to the ER . Usually around January . Then in patient . Prednisone . You know the drill . It all weighs a brother down . You know?

Tis That season . I guess .

I Am however reassured that the fall flares were diet induced more than anything . I had an allergic reaction to ‘Quorn’ brand ‘chicken’ . It’s quite clever actually . Fungi based . I let it sit too long I guess . That . Or someone spiked my One hard cider I had that night . The bastards 🤨

This past years one was just a falling back into old habits and patterns . Entyvio lulled me into false security. My Fault . Your boy goes such a long time on a strict diet . Then . Gets some booze . Pizza and wings in him and the dopamine gets  turned on high . The worm reawakens . Emotions become a mess . Couldn’t stop feeding the beast . Ultimately started bleeding again and fell into a flare . A real nasty one too .

This last one really kicked my ass 🥵 

This last year there was A Lot of movement and learnings and such and I continue to press forward .

We’ll be alright . This too shall pass

 I’m just trying to wrap my head around where I’m going . I’ve been taking my ‘medicine’ (MJ) today and as much as it helps with pain . It stifles other key parts of my life . My drive . Motivation . Confidence . Idk . 

I think this may be one more bridge I’m crossing throwing gasoline along as I do . 

Or maybe I’m just spinnin’ ma damn wheels 😣

But . I think I might burn the f’r down .

5141,Remission Milestone,krakk3rjack,20,dfp4m7,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/dfp4m7/remission_milestone/,1,"Today is what I take as my two year anniversary of being in remission. 


I’ve told my story a couple of times but here we go again. Abridged version. 

I was diagnosed in January 2017, with pan colitis and a pyoderma ulcer on my left shin, which grew to about 6in in diameter at its worst. I was hospitalised for three weeks. I honestly came to terms with death during that stay. The pain was worse than anything I’d ever experienced but the treatment put things at bay after the second week. The third week was observation and I was discharged. Placed into intensive out patient care as I needed my ulcer attended to. 

I did a second stint in hospital to stabilise my system a few months later as the remicade didn’t take. This time, I was living in a new city and under the care of a new GI. After a high dose steroid treatment I was out of hospital in 3 days and prescribed azathioprine as my long term treatment medication. During the steroid reduction, the azathioprine was taking hold. 
The side effects were brutal but my gut had no issues. My check up later that year in October showed a massive reduction in inflammation markers and I hadn’t had blood in the stool. Doc said I’d entered early remission. That was the first positive news I had heard in years so it’s why I take that date as time I entered remission. I think my mind stopped flaring too that day. He confirmed remission in March 2018. 


I’ve had some scares where I thought I was going to flare, but turned out to be something else. Earlier this year I got a viral infection. The stomach pains were reminiscent of a flare up, fortunately it was not. It was flu season by the way. Immunosuppressant drugs are a damn pain in the ass, you know what I mean. 

I hope for all of you going through the struggle that you’ll catch a break soon as I know what pain you’re going through. 

This disease is personalised bio warfare and hopefully your doc will get the right treatment for you. Meds and foods are different for nearly each patient. So while the doc figures out the meds, you work on your diet. I swear it plays a major role in your recovery. What works for me may not work for you. Be wary of what advice you listen too. 

The elimination diet plan lead me to an almost meat only diet. Others can eat vegetables and stuff but I have to avoid them. Our sensitivity varies so find your triggers and avoid them.

Stay strong and don’t give up. It’s difficult to remain positive when your life is turned upside down. Your mental state is just as important as the medication and food. Look after yourself and don’t ever feel isolated. There’s always people to talk to and listen here who know what you going through.  

Peace out fam and take care.",2019-10-10 01:10:36

I am absolutely over the moon with my son (10 days old now) and can't stop staring at the little guy. My wife is recovering well and both home / doing great.

The stress through the birth, all the late night hospital stays, worry, no sleep, poor diet / eating times combined with the huge anxiety / excitement of my newborn has left my colon in a lot of pain now and myself hugely fatigued.

My anxiety is high, my appetite has dropped to none and my colon pain (Distal UC) is a good 5/10 throbbing. I am hugely fatigued due to no sleep and feel dam right terrible already. Dizziness being my worse symptom, though a year on Prednisolone has meant my blood pressure is pretty high.

Now I can stop smiling and it's a good tiredness in a sense, I am just worried I am going to flare again.  I want to be fit and healthy to be able to look after my son and enjoy him growing up.

Since then I've been put on 4800mg lialda and 4g/60mL of rowasa a day. I stopped the linzess. I saw improvements for several days after I started the mesalamines but then this past Monday I went back to being extremely constipated after an episode of diarrhea in the morning.

I spoke with my doctor and they said it could be caused by the lialda, but I'm skeptical because constipation has always been my primary symptom. They prescribed me budesonide as well now.

I honestly can’t say for sure if it is from it or not. I know one of the side effects is nervous system: vision problems. Here’s my story:

I’ve had UC for about 18 years now. I started Humira in May because Imuran seemed to not be working anymore. I had a vision check up in June and my vision was the same, it hasn’t changed in about 10 years, I do wear contacts though. After taking my second maintenance dose of Humira in late June I woke up on a Thursday and noticed my vision was blurry, I shrugged it off as being tired and didn’t think much about it. Then on Friday I noticed again and the whole weekend I started to really worry. 

I ended up calling my doctor and optometrist on the following Monday and stopped taking Humira after talking to his nurse. I saw my optometrist that Thursday and by then my vision had improved quite a bit. Optometrist didn’t see anything noticeably wrong but did note my vision had become worse, probably 30/20 or 40/20 with my current prescription of contacts. He said he didn’t know much about the side effects of Humira, but said that he knows prednisone can affect your vision. He didn’t want to change my prescription because we both felt it may go back to normal regardless of what caused it.

I was tapering off prednisone at the time but I’ve taken prednisone on and off the last 18 years of my life and never had this problem. It’s now been 2-3 months and most days my vision is blurry, not terrible but probably 40/20. Some days I wake up and it’s crystal clear, it’s really weird. I am going to make another appointment with my optometrist but didn’t know if anyone else has experienced this side effect before. My doctor’s nurse and my Humira rep acted like they’d never heard of people having this problem before.",2019-10-18 17:50:13

I was diagnosed with UC in 2014, my senior year of high school. I got accepted and starting going to my dream school, Syracuse University, in 2015. I was on Lialda then. I started flaring really badly in November, around Thanksgiving, and had to transfer home at the end of the semester. Lialda didn't work for me, it was time to try something new. I started school at WCSU in Spring of 2016. I was on Humira for about 8 months and it almost seemed like it worked- until it didn't in the late summer of 2016. I was put in the hospital for severe dehydration and, you guessed it, another flare up.

A week later I was discharged. I changed all of my classes to online courses and my doctor thought it was time to try Remicade, my first infusion medicine. It worked like a charm. I had my life back and a really nice routine of going for a walk in the morning (this was just after Pokemon Go came out so that helped motivate my exercise) followed by doing school work and reading all day. This was my best semester at college yet in terms of grades, but I missed the social aspect of it. Remicade was still working through the spring and fall of 2017: I got to live on campus, join the radio station, and broadcast football and basketball games without worrying about the effects of my disease. I even forgot about it sometimes. And then over winter break of 2017, I started flaring again. My doctor had another medicine for me, Entyvio. Once again it started working well and my life felt almost normal in about 6 weeks and stayed that way for about seven months.

Fall 2018: I was back on campus, meeting some of the best friends I have ever had, and I began to notice the symptoms of medicine failing, I went to my doctor about it. He started me on 40mg of prednisone said not to worry until things got ""really bad"", but in the meantime sent me to Yale New Haven hospital to meet a liver specialist because he was worried that all of the medications might have impact my liver (yay something else to worry about). The specialist put me on another medicine and wanted to check back in with me in a couple months. This lasted for the fall, winter, and spring, into the summer of 2019. 

It was August of this year when I started coming off of the prednisone. Entyvio was deemed a failure and there was one medicine left for me, XelJanz. I have been on this medication for a little over two weeks and there has been no change in the flareup symptoms. My doctor said to give it another three weeks before we make a decision on surgery. Given my luck, surgery will be the next- and final- chapter in this story. 

Because of this disease I have missed out at living what most people my age are calling ""the best years of life."" I went to the #3 party school in the nation and spent every night in my room afraid of the side effects of UC. I have gained 20 pounds due to prednisone, have scars from the acne it has given me, and lost relationships because ""You never do anything and let this condition control your life."" I have missed trips to Las Vegas and New York that would have been provided for free through my school, and I am afraid of the future where I have to try and find a full time job while managing symptoms. I wouldn't wish life with this disease on the worst people in the world.

I've had a ""bad"" knee since getting hit by a car when I was 8 (i'm 37 now.)  I'm currently 5ft 11inches and about 240lbs.  I've been as high as 280lbs and as low as 230lbs over the last 18 months while I try to figure out what foods work and what foods don't (i've got a few other autoimmune issues, so finding the right balance is tricky).

All of that said, I have sore knees, sore back, sore almost everything.  Some weeks/months it's great and I don't feel bad.  Some days (all last week), I get sharp pain in wrists, ankles, elbows, back, knees, etc enough to wake me from sleep.  It doesn't really coincide with weather patterns that i've noticed, and it never swells.  It just simply hurts to move.

I had a remicade infusion Tuesday morning, which had hydrocortisone as a pre-med.  I've had this combination every 5 weeks for years, so nothing new.  On Wednesday, I noticed that my knees/back felt good.  Not excessively good, but they just didn't hurt at all.  They must've hurt a good bit beforehand because I don't normally notice a big change in my joints.

Fast forward to today (Saturday) and my legs are sore and stiff again.  Not prohibitively sore, just bothersome.  I still took the kids to swim class, walked around the mall, cooked and cleaned, etc.  But when I sit, I feel that familiar throb in my legs and back, and know it'll be there for another 4 weeks until my next infusion.

I had a minor flare up about 3 years ago due to me taking Ibuprofen (learned the hard way, should have listened) and got it under control using CBD (both smoking and putting drops under my tounge). Other than that I've been largely asymptomatic, but do use the porcelain throne A LOT, but rarely with discomfort.

I’m so used to googling my UC questions and/or panicking which usually leads to absolutely nothing (except making it worse from my own anxiety ofc). This might be kinda a long one but i genuinely am looking for advice/feedback. But ok, so, I was diagnosed with UC when I was 8 and have been dealing with it ever since, now 23. My problem has always been with constipation & stomach ulcers. The last time I had an unbearable UC flare up was 2 years ago and went to ER.

Last Friday I got my wisdom teeth removed and I was very anxious about the procedure (being treated for anxiety/depression and ive never felt comfortable in hospitals/dr offices to begin with). I gave my oral surgeon a run down of my GI issues but she assured me I would be fine  with the painkillers. I was prescribed 600mg tylenol and hydrocodon. I did not want to rely on the pain killers but my mouth pain was excruciating and I had dry socket so I used the pain killers. Starting on Monday, my UC flare up began.


The most frustrating part for me right now is the pain management, it feels like forever since ive felt “normal” and its been difficult doing even the simplest of tasks. My roommates offered me antiacids (tums & alkaseltzer) that i took for about a day and a half. Im an idiot for taking them but in the moment i wanted anything that would “help”. I was having painful bloody diarrhea for a couple of days and then I found out you shouldn’t be taking antiacids with UC because it can further inflame ulcers and stomach bleeding. UGH. So i stopped that immediately and started taking acetaminophen for my reminding mouth pain. My mouth finally started healing but my stomach is increasingly getting worse. Also, lucky me, I got my period.

I called my GI and earliest i could get an appt was for this wednesday (today is sunday). On Friday, I went to CVS because someone told me a heating pad could possibly help. When I went the pharmacist to ask him which heating pad would be better he said “neither” and after telling him I had UC he was like “Oh! you can take pepto for your pain/discomfort”. But then i told him how ive never really had the best relationship with pepto in the past (maybe have tried it 2-3 my entire life and my body has rejected it each time) but he reassured me it would help in the situation and i read the back of the box and it said nothing about “do not take if youre prone to stomach ulcers/bleeding” like the antiacids did so i bought it (and the heating pad bc i still wanted it”. I went home that night, took one dose, and violently threw it up for an hour. After googling pepto, surely enough there was the warning.

Since then ive been taking nothing but an acetaminophen here and there for lingering mouth pain. Ive been drinking a lot of water with electrolytes in it and eating bland, soft foods. Every night I hope I will wake up feeling a *little* better but no hope yet. I cant even get a lot of sleep at night without constantly running to the bathroom to release very loose stools. What kind of things do you do to manage excruciating UC flare ups? What do you guys eat in times like this? The pain is stabbing and uncomfortable. My appetite is so low but Ive been doing my best to slowly eat small meals. Any input is welcome, please.",2019-10-20 16:06:11

However, not only do I feel bad about bringing her into disabled toilets (she’s not an assistance dog and she’s dog aggressive so I can’t leave her outside unattended) but I hate how much it limits our walks. 

On my days off I love venturing further afield and going for longer walks out in the country. We can walk anywhere from 3 miles to 8+ miles on these walks. But because they are out of the way there are no toilets in case of an emergency. I recently went to a local graveyard, and they have a small toilet (but big enough for us both to fit) and this is great because it means we can walk for 2+ miles altogether without the fear of needing to go urgently. 

But I still hate the fact that I can’t go on my favourites routes with her purely because of my UC. What do you guys do for your walks when you are struggling with flare ups?

Hi Guys,

I have been suffering with IBS-D for around 5 years, I had previous testing for UC & Crohns years ago but it only showed mild symptoms of each so it was diagnosed as IBS-D.

My doctor has requested another round of testing, starting with some blood tests for inflammation. I am on an extremely strict diet and I never deviate, otherwise I am simply not able to function due to my symptoms.

My question is, do you guys think it would be worth deviating and eating something that I know sets off a flare before the blood tests, so the tests would give a reading on the kind of inflammation during a flare?",2019-10-22 11:40:15

It’s like my body knows that I’m almost home, and the urgency to go builds up the closer I get.

But with both, it’s like as soon as I wake up/walk through my front door my body wants me to just let er rip without fear of judgment.

I’ve always been one to avoid going to the restroom in public places, but can’t always control it, especially once my symptoms became severe this year. Has been such a relieving feeling that my body seemingly does this, super nice that I don’t have to be anxious about it in public as often.

5290,Newly Diagnosed,DS8730,2,dmxaho,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/dmxaho/newly_diagnosed/,2,"Just diagnosed on Tuesday with Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis, lots of fun.  Here's the story.

I believe it all started back in 2016 when I woke up late one night with a severe urgency to use the bathroom,  I rushed into the toilet and when I sat down blood literally gushed out of me.  This continued 3 or 4 more times, accompanied by severe cramping, and sweats.  I got concerned and took myself into the ER the next morning.  They treated me with some pain killers and IV fluids, did a CT scan and a digital examination to confirm blood.  They had no answers and simply scheduled my first colonoscopy. 

Fast forward to colonoscopy day, it was terrible.  Colon prep is seriously one of the worst things I have experienced, maybe it's because I like food, and/or hate cleaning my guts out for preparation.  Either way, they scoped me and all the doctor said he saw was a small polyp which was removed, no other cause for alarm.  This doctor was a general surgeon, not a GI doctor.  He removed the polyp and sent me on my way.  At this point I hadn't had any problems for 2 weeks, the bleeding had stopped, and I figured I had a clean bill of health.

Skipping ahead to the beginning of August 2019, I started to feel generally unwell.  I couldn't pinpoint the issue, it was general malaise.  After about two days of something not feeling right I noticed a significant amount of blood and white mucous in my stool, in my naive mind I figured it was probably another fluke like last time.  I let this continue  for 3 weeks, I learned that gas-x took care of the urgency because most of the time I was going to the toilet I was just gassy, but I always had blood whether I produced stool or not.  At the 3 week mark I made an appointment with my PCP who did a digital exam, poked my stomach a little bit and told me I would need another colonoscopy (yay lucky me).

2 weeks later I am back at the hospital having a colonoscopy done by a general surgeon, after the procedure he says he finds a significant amount of inflammation and blood but isn't exactly sure why.  He prescribes me a mesalamine enema and tells me he is going to refer me to a gastroeneterologist.  At this point I am still in denial, thinking it will go away, I refused to subject myself to a daily enema and so I never picked up the prescription and figured the GI doc would tell me I didn't need it, because I am still young and bulletproof, right?

Leading up to the appointment with my GI doc I was just getting frustrated with myself because my symptoms weren't improving and every day that passed I was more and more concerned about my overall health.  The day of my GI visit I went into his office and he very bluntly tells me that my PCP should've referred me to him to begin with, and that he nor any other GI doc would accept the test results from a colonoscopy performed by a general surgeon, at this point I'm a little bit confused.  He asked me if I was prescribed anything, I told him yes but I didn't fill it, and he says ""Good.""  This confuses me even more, and so I ask ""So, what does all of this mean?"" and he says the words I never wanted to hear....""I'm going to have to scope you again.""  I said something along the lines of ""You do realize that I just had this done 2 weeks ago right?""  He apologizes and says we have no option.  As you can probably guess, I am absolutely filled with joy at the thought of drinking Golytely until my guts come out of my anus for the 2nd time in the same month.

All said and done, scope is finished, he tells me I have UPS and says it is severe.  Puts me on, and forgive me for this but I can't remember the exact dose, but it's 2 mesalamine pills daily.  Today I will take my third dose and it feels like my world is coming down around me.  I still have this generally malaise feeling, but now I know where it's coming from, an uneasiness in my lower gut and it never goes away.  Still producing a lot of gas and blood, however the urgency seems to have almost completely disappeared, using the restroom 2-3 times daily.  I just can't seem to shake this feeling of impending doom, like my body is rejecting me and fighting to make my life miserable.  I guess maybe I'm just in the denial phase, but it really sucks.

TLDR: Newly diagnosed ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, in definite denial of lifelong health problems and feeling down.

I've (22f) been on asacol for about 7 years and I've been in remission for thr last 5 years. Recently had a colonoscopy and there was no sign of active colitis (yay). 

I recently changed hospitals (due to ease of access) and my new doctor has decided to change my medication to octasa. My previous doctor didn't want me on octasa while I was at uni, as some other patients had become ill on it. 

Fast forward and my new doctor has changed my  medication purely based on cost. I keep getting told asacol and octasa are exactly the same, but surely if octasa is cheaper to produce  then there must be some difference? 

What has been everyone elses experience changing from asacol to octasa? 

TIA

 I've been writing my IBD story on a blog for some time.

The objective for me is really just to raise awareness of what it can be like for us sometimes. 

There is too little said about the reality of the disease I feel.

I also find it therapeutic personally.

I do this through a series of blog posts called my IBD journey.

I'm in remission now. I'm really trying to  expand it into a resource that's potentially useful to newly diagnosed people or indeed anyone with IBD.

Anyway recently I made a video for the first time about making Probiotics at home.

 In this case Sauerkraut.

Next up I'm doing yoghurt probiotics.

I'm not that great at it and would appreciate some feedback.

Remember it's my first ever video pls.

Post is here:

https://www.my-ibd.co.uk/healthy-eating/probiotics/probiotics-how-to-make-gingercarrot-and-jalepeno-sauerkraut-video

Worth doing?

When I am in remission I just look up recipes online because I don't have too many dietary restrictions then, but now that I'm flaring again it would be super cool to have a collection of recipes that I know I should be able to eat without any issues and not have to check every recipe for ingredients that could cause problems. I'm pretty nervous about eating at the moment (it's only my second flare and my first one put me in the hospital, so I'm both super inexperienced and may have a false reference for what normally happens during flares because it was so extreme).

Thing is, most books I've found so far also focus on Crohn's, and many people in the reviews complained that due to this overlap, there's food listed that might work for one disease, but not the other. Most positive reviews were actually from people who don't have UC/Crohn's themselves and just bought it as a gift. I've also checked the table of contents of most books and often found something that I already know we shouldn't eat.

Long story short, if anyone knows a good website or a cookbook with recipes for us, it would be pretty cool if you could post it in the comments. I am located in Germany, so I might not be able to buy some books from the US or something, but please post anyways, it might still help someone else! :)",2019-10-26 15:37:01

I want to share my experience. I used Mutaflor from January until August and it helped me to heal up. Basically, my BM went down to 0-2 times per day, on average only 1. Urgency disappeared as well. It was a first time, after 3 years since I have UC, that I started to feel healthy.  
However, it is not recommended to use it during active flare up, it will just flush down Nissle 1917 bacteria.

I started using it when blood in the stool disappeared and since then I was quite surprised by results.

Unfortunately, It may be a problem finding Mutaflor. I am currently living in Poland and ordering it from Germany and it's not cheap :( 

Good news is that it does not have any side effects. So the most difficult part if you are in an active flare is to try to heal up as much as you can and then start using Mutaflor.

I was so happy with it, that I started experimenting with cottage cheese and yogurts and caused a new flare up :) But it took 2 months to heal it up and I am returning back to Mutaflor.

Here are some of the research documents that show it's effectiveness:

1. Maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis with the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is as effective as with standard mesalazine  [https://gut.bmj.com/content/53/11/1617](https://gut.bmj.com/content/53/11/1617) 
2. Role and mechanisms of action of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis patients: An update  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4917610/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4917610/) 

I hope this will help someone, if you have any questions feel free to ask.

If you used Mutaflor, please share your experience! :)",2019-10-28 20:32:45

I am 19 years old and I have had Ulcerative Colitis since summer of 2015. The following 4 years have been a little difficult. I started to worry too about my UC lately and it has been like hell. I constantly think about my UC.

So one day I saw a Facebook post about a 13 year old boy, that lives in my town. The boy was diagnosed with a brain tumor. My heart went pretty sad. As I read through the post, I started to question myself. ""Is my condition really worse than this kid's?"" Don't get me wrong. UC is a really bad disease, but this kid has a very high chance of dying. And this thought makes me thankful for my UC. Because it could be much most worse. 
As the days went by, I saw a young person in a wheelchair. The same thought came up again to my mind. I will rather have UC than losing the ability to walk. I am beginning to consider myself lucky and appreciate myself. 

So if you're one day sad about your UC. Just remember. It could be much worse. Just keep fighting for victory and don't lose hope.",2019-10-28 20:10:39

So, now I'm in the process of switching to Humira.  Question I have for everyone here is if you've had this happen before, what's the likelihood that I'll build up a tolerance to Humira just as quickly?

I’ve had UC for over four years now and let me tell you the only medicine besides the prednisone that is effective at treating my disease is the medical cannabis. Instant alleviation’s of pain,  regaining appetite and mobility less stress and anxiety. All of these things I gained from my prescription. 


Now unfortunately there’s quite the downside to this being that it can rather hard to function a normal life if you had to constantly get high. So while I am not advocating this as a cure of any kind I highly recommend to anyone who is still really struggling or if their state has a program for it. 


I do understand the negative stigma behind marijuana and yes there are still many things we don’t have fully researched but as someone who literally had no concept of living anymore do to the disease this truly was my saving grace and I just wanted to put it out there for anyone else considering, you truly never know what could help.",2020-01-01 01:24:06

Starting out with Pentasa 4 mg enemas daily, and have follow up with GI doc in 3 months.  I rolled my eyes when reading that “stress management” may be helpful...I have been in therapy and on meds for over 2 years for PTSD/MDD/anxiety, so no doubt that doesn’t help.  

Hope to learn more and will be following.

I think I have to re-engage with medicine. Last time I was prescribed imurel (Azathioprine) which made me constantly tired and achy and omeprazole and claversal (mesalazine). The mesalazine caused pericarditis which was terrifying and very painful.

What treatment can I expect or what can I hope for in contemporary therapy? As a child I had prednisolone which I hated.

I'm 39 years old. In 2016 I was having some pain in my bottom, not terrible but definitely uncomfortable, with some mild bleeding every so often and the occasional leakage. Had a colonoscopy which showed mild Proctitis. I was given Pentasa suppositories which for the most part controlled symptoms. 

I have been very fortunate that up until last month I haven't really had any more problems, but in early December I noticed blood on the toilet paper and in the bowl whenever I'd go to the toilet. I can literally see the blood drip out of me when I'm on the lookout.  I'm also passing a lot of mucus.  Pentasa has made no difference.  I have had no abdominal pain aside from a bit of sciatica in my butt which could be unrelated and my stools are relatively normal aside from being a bit narrow. 

I guess I just want to know if anyone with Proctitis has experienced this sort of increase in symptoms. I'm imagining it may have developed into Ulcerative Colitis but the lack of pain or upset tummy makes me a bit unsure - guess I won't really know till I finally get into see the doctor in the month and presumably get another colonoscopy.

For a quick history, \~40 yr old white male, GI issues started in 2018/19 with an anal fissure that kept re-opening and then was complicated by a couple small superficial fistulas and perianal skin issues.  Had a ""minor"" fistulotomy a year ago then LIS a couple months later (actually brought up IBD with a couple doctors but thought fistula related to the fissure which started after some hard bowel movements).  Fissure symptoms improved but still felt a bit off, finally saw a GI who ordered MRI (normal) but after my stomach started to bloat in late Nov we did a colonoscopy (I was due anyway for family history, had clean one six years ago).  Sure enough, colonoscopy showed inflammation up to sigmoid colon (he told me later it was around 40 cm and was pretty mild, ""almost like a sunburn"") and biopsy came back for ""active chronic colitis.""  I started 4.8g of Lialda four weeks ago and then when I still felt crappy through the New Year I've started some enema treatment the last few nights.  I also have been taking Citrucel the past year to help with the fissure (colonoscopy confirmed fissure gone which is great at least).

Bowel movements pretty normal, no blood or diarrhea (the only time I get bad diarrhea is after running, that's what probably caused the fissure two years ago).  I do have tenesmus and cramping/bloating that really started around Thanksgiving and hasn't gotten much better despite being on the medication.

I did a stool sample two weeks ago (after a week of being of Lialda) and my calprotectin levels were below 15 and my blood levels were fine.  I still am symptomatic (I realize my symptoms are VERY tame compared to what many go through) so GI (who I like a lot) said try mesalamine enema for a few weeks.  The blood/stool markers being normal was a bit surprising.

Not much more to add, the physical symptoms aren't any worse than what I went through for months with the fissure but still a little down about having a chronic disease.  Have a very strong support network and not afraid to take medicine but also do have history of health anxiety that is popping up here.",2020-01-05 19:31:20

I want to start working out (not just for the weight loss, but to develop an overall better lifestyle and keep up with my energetic kids). However, every time I start a routine, I send myself into a mild flare. I'm tired of being a couch potato, but at the same time, I'm scared to start anything and end up back at square one. Even a simple yoga routine seems to make me have to run to bathroom. I'm at a loss. What do y'all do for exercise?

Not a day goes by where he does not put my health and well-being above his though I encourage him to put his first at times. My husband is my rock and my foundation for all things in life.

I’m still taking humira and a just bumped my dose of prednisone from 40mg to 60mg as I wasn’t seeing improvement, just started 60mg today, crossing my fingers. 

I’ve been thinking about next steps, sand was wondering if I just go surgery route, and avoid biologic trial and error. 

Thinks I’ve tried. 

Mesalamine( determined I may be allergic, as I kept getting worse) 
Hydrocortisone enemas - on it now. These got me out of one of my first flares years ago, but don’t seem to have much impact if any since then. 
Prednisone - initially 20mg kicked me out of some flares, them had to go to 40 for my last one, now trying 60  
Humira - started at the time I kicked the flare with the last time I was on prednisone. 


It sounds like next steps would be give other biologics a shot. 

I’m scared of how long that can take, I heard some of them like Entyvio can take close to a year. It just feels like I can’t manage a flare for that period of time, right now. 

Another thing beyond the time involved with the trial and error is that I’m concerned about wasting all my run on these biologics, at 31 years old. I get concerned that It can evolve into crohns where surgery may not be as helpful, and if I ran through all the biologics at that point, then what do I do? I guess my thinking is, that maybe I opt for surgery to deal with UC, and save my chance to use these biologics in case it comes back as crohns. 

Would love to hear people’s thoughts and opinions on this approach of looking to surgery a bit earlier than usual.

In British Columbia, the government [announced](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/pharmacare-for-bc-residents/what-we-cover/drug-coverage/biosimilars-initiative-patients) on September 5, 2019, that patients using Remicade® for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease & ulcerative colitis) will have to switch to a [biosimilar](https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/biosimilars/) medication (Inflectra® or Renflexis®). PharmaCare claims it is because the biosimilars are cheaper, but the manufacturers of Remicade® have agreed to match the lower price, and PharmaCare refuses to allow patients to remain stable on their original biologic even though there is no financial benefit to the province. Patients have until **March 5, 2020** until PharmaCare coverage ends.

Alberta followed with a policy [announcement](https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=67300D37177B0-CFD0-440F-CCBA177C758B8061) on December 12, 2019, affecting an estimated 26,000 patients with certain types of arthritis, diabetes (Type 1 and 2), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), neutropenia, and multiple sclerosis. Government-sponsored drug plan coverage for originator biologics, which includes Remicade®, will be discontinued as of **July 1, 2020**, leaving those affected with just six months to see their specialist and healthcare team to switch to a biosimilar and enroll in a new patient support program, if necessary. Similarly, the manufacturers of Remicade® released a [statement](https://www.janssen.com/canada/sites/www_janssen_com_canada/files/janssen_statement_on_alberta_governments_biosimilar_initiative.pdf) that they negotiated with the government to match the lower price. The policy does not yet affect those with private drug plans, but we think it might soon. 

Our position is that patient-physician choice must be respected and preserved. This is especially important for patients who are stable on the biologic. If you are one of the affected individuals, we want to help you. Please [contact us](https://badgut.org/forced-to-switch/?fbclid=IwAR0iPe2uR8fWjv-t0gqfaGOuPyNwwWInKFbWjJ0sT3Xu7BJuqk2W3nn42tI) to share your story.

I don't want to go through the surgery option because I'm not sure if it will work. I read for some it works and some it doesn't.

I don't know what to do and I am tired of feeling like this and would like to get my life back on track. I won't be able to survive much longer like this.

I now shit 3 times a day with the very occasional blood and i feel generally pretty good compared to my last flare. That said, my tummy still doesn’t feel “normal.” So I figured maybe a diet change would improve things. I usually eat whatever the fuck I want which ends up being processed white food. Veggies fuck me up, cooked and raw, and so does heavy dairy. Processed food usually goes down easier but who really knows cause I’ve never stopped eating it. 

Anyways, I started on a no sugar/gluten & light dairy (only low-lactose cheeses—cause ya girl ain’t giving up cheese completely) diet on Sunday with hopes that if I treat my body like I probably should, it’ll be nice to me. Yet, I’m currently on my sixth shit today and I’m shitting out my lunch whole. Is the dramatic change fucking with my system??? What is gods name is going on in there???

I've been struggling for over a year now. Many flares

On week 6 of humira.

Been on prend for months. Started with 2 120mg injections then 70mg orally per day.

Prwd is the devil. After starting humira with GIs advice started to taper.things started to improve over the first 4 weeks of humira.

For the last 2 weeks. I have been feeling awful.

I get up at 5am and go to poo about 10 times. Each time it's an uncontrollable urge to poo but is mostly gas followed by the most extremes pressure.

Best I can describe it is me trying really hard to push one out... But I'm not pushing...it just happens. Its kind of painful but mostly my body just spasms and makes me moan. A bit of poo may or may not come out.

The main problem is that this effort knocks me out. I get intensely cold afterwards and just can't warm up and have uncontrollable shivers. Once I stop going to the loo, I warm up then feel normal.

Went to the doc he said I had a virus (due to sore throat and that was making inflammation worse). Also it has given me haemorrhoids which is exacerbating the problem.

Yesterday I felt fine all day maybe this virus is going I thought. Today worse than ever.

I know none of us are doctors but anyone have any ideas.

I'm currently tapering pred and on 20mg.

The meds had cleaned out
So every thing was flowing.
Prednisone stood on the counter with care
Along with the emergency underwear spare.
My family was asleep, as it was late
But I wasnt sleeping, on this very important date.
I had taken the sofeners, had the MiraLAX,
And new that tomorrow I'd have a seven hour nap.
When from deep in my bowels there arose such a clatter
I sat up on the toilet, to ready for the matter.
Opening the cabinets grabbing extra T.P
I prepared for one more push to release what was in me.
Just before it hit I thought ""what could it be?,
What was the food that is about to explode from me?"" 
The smell hit first, and I nearly passed out
Usually it's bad but this has woke the house.
I could physically feel myself turning green
And knew in a moment it must be the beans. 
Like the world's worst waterfall it all left my body
There was a knock at the door to the room with the potty: 
""Now listen, you shittin', and farting and pissin',
We were sleepin', and breathin', and you woke us all""
And through the gas and the cramps I was able to call:
""It's the last time I promise, they're going to make me right!
Then maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to sleep tight.
I'll get some good rest, and be back to my full might,
Happy surgery to me, I can't wait for tomorrow night!""

I am in talks with my GI about surgery in the next few weeks/months but thought I would ask if anyone has had any success with diets/treatments that I have yet to try? I have fully accepted surgery as a solution and have a positive outlook on getting my life back, even if it's with an ileostomy bag. However, I thought I would see if anyone has had relative success with anything I haven't tried, below are all the medications and diets I have tried:

MEDICATIONS:

Asacol, Remicade, Humira & Imuran, Entyvio, Stelara, Filgotinib, Simponi, Xeljanz

DIETS:

Low FODMAP, No FODMAP, Vegan, LCHF Vegan, LCHF, Lectin-Free, Keto, Paleo, Carnivore, SCD, Mediterranean Diet, High Probiotic Diet, IBD AID

One of the most important things in battling UC is having a healthy life outlook so no matter what lies ahead of me that will remain.

So what do I do? I push my limits. 

I'm an avid lover of the outdoors. I'm a northerner. As my fellow Canadians know, we're going through a cold snap. 

-38 and four feet of snow on the ground, beautiful sunny day, I decided to go check the memory cards in my trail cams (I love getting photos of lynx). This included a 3km loop by snowshoe. 

I'm wearing long underwear, softshell fleece pants, then a biv snowsuit that goes over the shoulders. Over that is a sweater and a parka.

Let me remind you it was -38 with wind chill this morning. I have NEVER EVER experienced the shrinkage I experienced this morning, but believe now that men evolved the ability to shrink up in the cold to avoid frost bite with UC.

Main question here is does stress exacerbate your symptoms, and if so, what type of stresses? What lifestyle changes have you made to lower your stress? Below is a background of how I (27F) have been functioning before and after my diagnosis, and just truly asking for advice and tips on what has helped you with your UC. 

It’s been 10 months since I’ve been diagnosed, and have been in the process of figuring out what medication works. I’ve been hospitalized a lot, and haven’t really been “normal” for more than a month long period. I understand that there can be significant stress and anxiety surrounding newly diagnosed patients and just UC in general, especially with continuous symptoms. 

I am rounding out my month long break from work to figure out my health. Prior to my break, I was going in to work inconsistently mainly due to stomach pain and fatigue. I am a consultant structural engineer working for an understanding mid-sized firm in Seattle. With the nature of my work, stress is unavoidable with project deadlines, etc., but I do get to sit in an office all day. On the business end, my company has had a hard time with my inconsistent schedule, and that’s completely understandable. 

I am realizing how much stress really plays into my UC, and I am just curious as to how stress affects other folks and how you combat that? I am a person who has always thrived in stress, and loves being busy. Since I got diagnosed, I have had a hard time slowing down, even when I am sick. I mistakenly signed up for my licensing board exam in the thick of things; going to work, and immediately going to a cafe to study from 7-11pm for about 3 months. That decision landed me in the hospital, a lot, but I passed. I still volunteer a lot of my time to organizations that I had commitments to prior to my diagnosis. Plus I love to exercise, mostly climb, and that takes up about 3-4 nights of the week. And the usual responsibilities we all have as an adult and the ones to our family, friends, work, and whatever else. 

During this past month, I have focused on my holistic health a lot more than I have before. I eat much healthier; reducing dairy, sugar, grains whenever I can, and cooking almost all of my meals. I have slowly started to appreciate yoga. I understand my body a little better, and it has just made me more aware of energy level. I now schedule rest days, which I have never done before. I work part time, and I don’t say yes to everything anymore. It’s been a lifestyle change, and I am still figuring it out and failing every now and then. In a way, by doing these changes, I am hoping that my stress and anxious personality can basically take a chill pill.

I am very open to trying out things as long as they are reasonable for myself. I’m hoping these small daily acts can help me with this attitude change I am hesitantly embracing of I can’t do everything. I have missed out on a lot and I know I’ll miss out on so much more, but how do I keep a cool head when UC sucks?",2020-01-15 22:25:27

5522,"Need Insight: Reactive Arthritis, Ulcerative Proctitis, & Humira + Methylprednisolone",feem3r,3,ep7zeu,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ep7zeu/need_insight_reactive_arthritis_ulcerative/,2,"I was diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis in early October of 2019 after a multi-month trial and error with doctors and tests. I was also diagnosed with reactive arthritis at the same time due to painful and debilitating swelling of certain joints (jaw and knees to the point of not being able to chew or walk) along with inflammed eyes. My primary doctor for treating all this is a Rheumatologist per my primary care physician's order. 

The proctitis itself seems fairly mild and it is presumed that it was caused by an overly strong immune response to a Chlamydia infection that was treated with antibiotics in August. 

&#x200B;

In Septepmber/October I was on prednisone for about 5 weeks doing a burst and taper - symptoms improved when I was on \~40mg and 30mg but then came right back at 20 and 10mg. Sience then I've been on HUMIRA which helped the joint/swelling issues to some degree but not my bowel issues (e.g. urgency of BMs and blood in stool, which didn't improve day-to-day). 

&#x200B;

In December I increased HUMIRA injections to once a week which has marginally improved the joint issues I'm having (still have some pain and swelling at this dose) but still no real improvements in bowel issues. 

&#x200B;

I saw my Rheumatologist last week and he decided that being on Methylprednisolone for 20 days, HUMIRA, and Methotrexate all at once was the next step. I was very resistant as I HATE prednisone -it REAALLY messes with me, my sleep in particular, but I eventually decided to take the Methylprednisolone. 

&#x200B;

I haven't taken the Methotrexate though as there seems to be many side effects for no real/proven benefit according to several studies. Being on three immunomodulators at once is also really scary. Just being on Pred and Humira at the same time is really scary. 

&#x200B;

I won't be able to get another GI's opinion on all these drugs for another 2 weeks or my primary care's opinion for another week. Am I being foolish not taking the Methotrexate?

&#x200B;

I need advice. My condition hasn't improved at all since starting HUMIRA with various prednisone burst & tapers - HUMIRA has only helped manage the swelling.

&#x200B;

This has been going on so long without improvement. I don't know what else I can do. I just cannot do prednisone again. 

&#x200B;

I've tried changing my diet. I've been off of dairy, sugar, gluten, hard/issue foods (beans, quinoa, broccoli, cabbage, etc.) for about 2 - 3 months. I had some cabbage the other day which seemed to worsen overall symptoms.  I'm seeing a dietician today but am not super optimistic that this will help much. The only other thing I can think to cut out is green tea (caffeine) and dark chocolate (low sugar). Besides that I'm not sure what I can do. I take fish oil, turmeric + black pepper capsules and ashwaghanda capsules. I try to eat a lot of fish and well cooked veggies like squash/carrots/sweet potatoes. 

&#x200B;

I'm really stressed and just can't have this, at least at this intensity, keep going on. Any suggestions on other medications, diet/lifestyle interventions, or other treatments/adaptations that helped you?",2020-01-15 21:34:31

So I started my medication to deal with my flare a few weeks ago now. It has really started to kick in and now I don’t have any blood in my poop, and my stomach is acting pretty normal again, yay! 

One thing though: When I was flaring, I basically only ate meat and refined carbs, because fiber was making it worse imo. Since I started to feel better I’ve slowly started incorporating foods I hadn’t had in a while, like veggies and fruits.

Well a few days ago I had probably too many veggies at once 2 days in a row, looking back, and I got a little discomfort and was constipated  with gas and I had a big BM a day later. Today I had some ice cream I made (coconut milk and strawberries only) and I am having similar discomfort now with a good amount of gas. 
Do you think this is caused by the food I’m eating or my UC or a mix of both? (my UC usually causes constipation, not frequency/urgency) Maybe I’m reintroducing these foods too quickly...",2020-01-15 02:17:10

As I'm not sick with a cold or anything and taking a day off, I literally have to be there or I will flare up again. I kind of assumed because I was on a temp contract maybe I wouldn't get as many benefits or anything. I'm a little bit worried about my financial situation atm so I'm trying to make sure I'm not missing out on getting paid when I should. If anyone knows where I could find more info about this or help me out that would be great. I do accrue holiday pay which I claimed before Christmas but you have to wait a while before it builds up to anything significant. I talked to my payroll company before but they weren't too knowledgeable and just said to claim holiday pay. I've increased the amount of hours I work recently to try and earn more but I've got a hospital appointment coming up soon and it got me wondering.

Is that normal?  From what I've seen some of you guys get them every year.  Which is a bit more often than what my GI suggested, haha.  Thanks again, and sorry for the double topics, I'm still learning about my condition and such.",2020-01-18 05:55:34

Hi there

After having been lurking around for the past few days, I thought it might be helpful if I were to share my recent (ongoing actually) experience of a Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD) while getting through a flare up of UC. 

 The background to my disease is that I am a 30 year old male, and was diagnosed when I was 19. My UC is mostly left-sided, though my last scope did show some slight involvement in my ascending large intestine too (as well as an inverted appendix…) I had been in remission for almost the past 2 years, and before that I had gone through several cycles of 6 months or a year of remission, followed by an attack of around 3 months each time. 

I have been hospitalised 3 times, for various infusions of steroids and immunosuppressants, though have been drug free for the past 5 years (no maintenance drugs, no steroids, no immunosuppressants). I am drug free because I’ve found that my flares are essentially resistant to all drug treatments, and last time I was on a course of oral prednisolone, my legs swelled up so much that my jeans had to be cut off, as well as developing a very strange rash, followed by a week in hospital. They were also entirely ineffective in treating the attack, much less bringing about a period of sustained remission.

I have been intermittent fasting (eating all food within 8 hours each day) for years, and have always felt that that has helped me to manage symptoms quite effectively. I eat mostly vegan, though I have a fear that this attack did coincide with the enjoyment of some particularly dank blue cheese. 

My current healthcare situation is that I’m an Irish national, living in Canada temporarily, with no coverage, and so no doctor. I have moved around a lot in the past 10 years since I was diagnosed, and so haven’t had any ongoing or consistent care for a long time.

This combination of lack of consistent medical care, terrible experiences with the drugs, and I guess a certain stubbornness, caused me to put some more research into how I could manage my disease myself with diet. 


FMD:

You can find the specifics on FMD in various places, and I won’t use this post to discuss its ins and outs, however the research and clinical experience of its inventor, Dr Valter Longo, are contained in his book The Longevity Diet (https://valterlongo.com/the-longevity-diet/)

As part of his research, Longo has developed a product called ProLon, which contains ready-made meals for each of the 5 days of the fast. This would have been much easier, however the kit is very expensive ($250USD) and there is a warning of shipping delays to international customers (I am in Canada, and will be leaving the country at the end of the month), so I decided to have a go myself. 

I found the following guide online (https://foreverfreefrom.com/fasting-mimicking-diet-guide/) which I found very helpful. The spreadsheets are nicely laid out, and you can adjust the daily caloric intake based on your body mass. As the author makes extensive use of store-bought meals which are only available in the UK, I simply used his tables as a template, and added my own ingredients to make up the daily calories and macros. 

I’ll outline broadly my experience with FMD, and lay out some of the stupid mistakes I made.


THE SCENE:

Imagine it: it's a Sunday night, you're out with your friends. You're eating fries, drinking beers, and having a great time. Life is great, and you had almost forgotten that you had UC. Until, that is, you (just about) make it home, only for your butthole, werewolf like, to rain blood and mucus on you for the following 8 hours, as your pathetic mind and body try to find refuge in sleep, to defend themselves from the onslaught.

Needless to say, I was at this point done with this bullshit, and so I decided to see whether FMD could be a silver bullet.


PREP:

The first lesson I’ve learned, is prepare all your meals before you start. Cook them and fridge/ freeze them - my experience was that as my hunger increased, so my will to cook and nourish myself properly decreased. If you have any concerns whatsoever about your capacity to stick it out, then this is an important first step. Also, next time I will put in some serious effort to make the meals delicious, and the textures varied.

I wanted to eat 100% organic, and locally produced vegetables where absolutely possible, so I used the spreadsheet mentioned above, and dialled in the ingredients to match the calories and macros. This included vegetables of every colour (red and white cabbage, beetroot, orange and yellow carrots, spaghetti squash etc) so that I could be sure of eating a broad range of vitamins and minerals. After playing around with the spreadsheet, I found a blend of vegetables that worked perfectly. As I had already started the fast, I decided to simply stick with these ingredients, and eat them every day. In hindsight this was a mistake, as I found it incredibly unappetising to eat the same meal every day, and I was surprised to find that, despite the dramatically decreased calories, I found it extremely hard to motivate myself to eat. 

I am fortunate enough to have just finished my job, and so spending a week on the couch and in bed was totally possible. It would have been very difficult to complete the fast, however, if I was still working. My mood was quite volatile during the week (sorry to my lovely wife), and I was very asleep by 9pm each night (at the very, very latest). If you reckon you can power through a week of work on 700 calories a day, then more power to you, however I don’t think that that is something I could have done. 

The most important lesson I learned in preparing the food for the FMD is to make sure to carefully research every ingredient, and don’t assume “that sounds about right.” I had chosen some dried currants as part of the meal plan, however I mistakenly entered the nutritional information in the spreadsheet as that of fresh currants. This might not sound like a huge blunder, however dried currants are ~10x more calorific than fresh ones, meaning that I had to extend the fast an extra day, which was total shit.

The last thing I’ll say on prep is that I found it very useful to keep a diary on what I ate and when, how I felt and how my UC was behaving. This kept me grounded in the experience, and meant that it was easier to observe changes as the week went along.


THE FMD:

On days 1 and 2, I was still experiencing some intense urgency and cramps, and still shitting a lot in the night (5-6 times), all liquid, all with varying amounts of blood and mucus. My appetite was suppressed I think because of the cramps, and I actually found it difficult to eat everything (not helped by not having prepped delicious meals - see above).

By day 3, I did start to notice some improvement in terms of shit frequency (from 5-6 times in the night to 2-3), and the cramps started to ease off as well. My appetite really plummeted though, and it became a real struggle for me to eat everything, though I managed to by washing things down with water. I found that the texture of foods really bothered me (especially avocado), which was a shame, as I was supposed to eat 100g of it per day, and as a millennial, am supposed to already live off this shit.

By Day 4, I was definitely starting to feel a bit weird. I dragged myself out of the house to the shops, and was experiencing a strange sensation of clarity in my vision. I have since read that this can happen during ketosis, but it reminded me of the moment immediately before you start tripping. Not bad by any means, but a sign of stranger things afoot.

My UC cramps did start to subside by day 4, however this was counter-balanced with some horrible, horrendous indigestion. It felt like my stomach was being crushed like a crisp packet, and it became so bad that it disturbed my sleep a few times in the night. After doing some reading, it turns out that this is also a common side-effect of ketosis, and is most likely caused by dehydration. After a day or two of drinking enormous amounts of soda water, as well as twice-daily rehydration sachets, I started to feel much better. 

By Day 5, the indigestion was still severe, though the UC cramps had definitely diminished. I went to the toilet 3-4 times, and while I didn’t poop anything solid, there was less blood (on a couple of occasions no blood), and less mucus. 

Day 6 is re-feeding day, which is where we find ourselves. I have never enjoyed a slice of toast and peanut butter as much as I did this morning - the texture of the toast, after 5 days of baby food avocado mush was bloody great. As per the instructions in the book, I am re-feeding with complex carbohydrates only coming from plants, and by now (6 pm), am feeling pretty good. My UC has absolutely not gone, however I do feel that my symptoms are more under control, and I have had a good stretch without cramps this afternoon. I’ve even successfully farted.


THOUGHTS:

Having just finished the FMD, it already feels like a long, long time ago. I had thought that I would be excruciatingly hungry for the duration, however that simply was not the case. Perhaps due to the severity of the cramps going into the fast, which always tend to diminish my appetite, and perhaps due to the objectively disgusting pulp that is the avocado, I really struggled to eat everything every day. 

I’ve already outlined my thoughts on preparation above, but I think this really is the most important step. When I do this again, I’ll spend plenty of time on recipes, making sure that the food has texture, as well as being interesting and appetising. 

I had not anticipated how awful the indigestion would be - it was fucking excruciating. In the future, I’ll make sure I’m loaded up on Omeprazole before beginning the fast, and will buy a soda stream specially for it. 

While the ProLon kit is expensive, I think I will use it next time. Part of the experience of the fast was wondering if I was doing it properly, which is a very hard thing to know. My breath was terrible (a reliable sign of ketosis apparently), and the stomach cramps seemed to confirm dehydration which is a common side-effect, though it’s really hard to know if I absolutely nailed the nutrition. Plus, all proceeds from the kit go back into the research foundation, so I’m ok with a couple of hundred of my dollars going towards a good thing.

The FMD absolutely made me lose weight, mostly made up of water and visceral fat. I am 175cm, and weighed 72.5kg on Monday morning. As of this morning, I weigh 69kg. Much of that will be water, though my waist has undoubtedly become slimmer. 

The real benefit, according to Longo, comes in the re-feeding period, as the body repairs itself with the healthy nutrition you give it after the period of fasting. The studies described in the book consist of results taken after 3 cycles of FMD, over the course of 3 months, so I guess I shall have to do another 2 in the next couple of months to get a proper picture. 

Overall, I will do the FMD again - as much as anything, it has reconnected me to my digestive system in a caring way, as opposed to simply hating it because it is malfunctioning. It was a good opportunity to spend a week reading and doing mostly nothing, which I think is probably beneficial in its own right, regardless of the fast. 

UPDATE: As helpfully pointed out, I should clarify that I am explaining changes in UC symptoms DURING the FMD, not BECAUSE of the FMD. 

I hope this hasn’t been too long, and I hope it will be of some use to someone!",2020-01-20 00:48:02

The whole end of 2019 was a mess for me. I've always been healthy and have never been hospitalised but in October I started getting sick. First of all I lost my appetite and started having diarrhea. I had a fever for one night and the next day I was throwing up everything I ate. It got to the point where I couldn't even keep liquid down. My mum ended up driving me to the emergency room because I was so dehydrated and weak with no sign of me getting any better.

My heart rate was really fast at 130 or up to 160 (due to dehydration and also they assumed I probably had an infection) and my blood pressure was really low. I was put on IV and under went tests (urine, x ray of chest and abdomen, blood test etc.). A week after being hospitalised the results of an MRI showed that my intestines were extremely inflamed and I was diagnosed with UC. Was put on steroid medication among a few others.

Exactly 2 weeks after being hospitalised they gave me a blood transfusion and a couple bags of IV fluid and sent me home. They said I was well enough to go and continue healing at home as there was nothing to do jow but wait to heal on the medication. 3 days later I wake up with excruciating pain in my right side under my ribs and I was struggling to breathe. My mum drove me back to hospital where I was hospitalised again and given blood thinning injections as they were worried it could be a blood clot in the lung. That ended up not being the case. After a CT scan they basically told me that the top of my intestines had gotten really inflamed, had irritated my diaphragm which caused a build up of fluid, giving me pneumonia... Aren't I lucky.

The whole pneumonia thing was worst than the UC. Had to be on morphine the first 2 days in hospital because I couldn't even breathe without excruciating pain so it was impossible to move or sleep. The antibiotics cleared it slowly, and after another week I was released from hospital.

Now I'm trying to get my shit back together. It's January 2020 and I still haven't gone back to school because it's taken me so long to recover - I may have to redo this school year. I luckily was home in time for christmas but I couldn't eat any of the Christmas food. I'm trying to figure out what I can and can't eat with the help of a dietitian (I'm currently on the GAPS diet). It's my birthday soon and I have a concert coming up but I now get anxious about outings like this because I'm worried about getting pain on that day or having to cancel. I'm also tired all the time and am not really sure what I'm doing. I feel a lot better but I came off of the steroid medication recently (8 week course finished) and I think the pain got worse, as in is more frequent, but I'm not sure because I also identified a food that I've been eating that was causing pain. I'm now just on 4 tablets of Mezavant a day (5000mg). Any info about this medication? I'm confused on what does what at this point.",2020-01-19 20:51:03

5581,Frustrated with this disease,DifferentAmbition,13,erl5je,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/erl5je/frustrated_with_this_disease/,3,"After finding out that I was in remission in around late October, I found two months of relief afterwards. My stools weren't always perfect, but it wasn't diarrhea and I was only having 1 BM a day. Urgency was still present however it just came and went. It wasn't really an issue.  

I really felt like things were returning to normal. I was able to stop relying on wearing my Depends, and I was even able to eat out at restaurants without many issues. Life was starting to feel normal again. I was looking forward to returning to college in January. It begins in three days.  

But now it seems like I'm starting to head back into a flare as I've started seeing blood and mucus in my stool. And I'm starting to have diarrhea again. I've upped my mesalamine meds in hopes that it will help relieve me of my symptoms.  

I'm starting to doubt my decision to go back (to college) and I almost want to consider dropping my classes for the second straight semester. I have so much anxiety about my symptoms being disruptive to me during my studies. But if I don't go, then I won't get any money back to support myself (due to financial aid giving me a surplus of money) and it will be extremely difficult for me to find a job in the meantime. There is so much pressure on me to attend this semester from both a financial standpoint and a parental standpoint. But I don't know if I can do it.   

It's just really frustrating how unpredictable this disease is and how you have to always plan around it. Or how it decides to rear its ugly head in the most inconvenient of times. It's the moments like these that really kill off any desire for me to live my life. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal or severely depressed. But I don't see the point anymore when I'm just going to keep getting disrupted by these symptoms over and over during my school/work/social life. It's honestly really sad to see myself turn from a highly driven outgoing individual, into this anxious shut in who just wants to play video games all day to distract myself from this horrible reality.",2020-01-20 23:47:36

I got admitted for the first time for a huge flare 5 weeks ago. Got started on Remicade. Two weeks later I was discharged home. 

Then a week later I caught high fevers and ended up in ER again. UC was flaring up again and I was told that it’s the likely cause of the fevers but since I was immunosuppressed they wanted to check me out for every possible infection they could think of. This included dozens of stool urine and blood cultures. 

They also decided to run a CT scan and as they scanned they found abnormal growth on my right kidney.  Another CT and MRI later it was confirmed that it’s cancerous and needs to be removed. Likely I’ll lose full or part of my kidney. So currently I’m back home, UC thankfully is well under control but heading to surgery in next 2-3 weeks. 

Funny thing to say but if I didn’t have UC my cancer may not have been picked up in time as I had no symptoms of a kidney disease. Whatever UC has to throw at me for rest of my life, I’ll forever be grateful that it may have just saved my life at 32. I’ve lost all resentment I may have held for this disease. 

I’m also thankful for doctors who did not just assume that fever was from UC and went hunting for a possible infection however remote it may be. I’m also thankful for living in the country where I’m getting all this medical support for absolutely free, allowing me to not have to rush to work to pay any medical bills.

My little one just turned 15 weeks, so (we think) with the stress of a newborn, new emotions and no sleep kicked off a flare up of epic proportions.
Couldn’t bottle feed him as couldn’t stay out of the bathroom for long enough.

Xeljanz just decided to quit on me (doc is very surprised as it blocks a pretty specific immune pathway).
Doc quickly got me on Stelera (deductible hit by 1/6 lol) and taper of steroids (usual 60mg starting dose).

Steroids took about 10 days to start working, but finally the symptoms are under control!

My skin has got bad but at least I can spend time with my little one without worrying about how/where I am going to manage the toilet situation <- this created a whole new world of stress!

Keep up hope everyone, I know it feels 1 step forward and 2 steps back occasionally, but we’re all making progress, and it seems like so is the medical profession. 
It’s re-assuring to see the amount of research going on to a variety of different approaches.

Fingers crossed the Stelera continues to work as I drop the steroids. I’d forgotten what anything other than the inside of my bathroom door looks like! 
Sending you all good vibes!

For anyone interested (as I think it helps to share this stuff) - I’ve recently started eating an AID diet to assist the recovery. Starting with cutting out all alcohol, red meat, gluten, lactose, caffeine and processed sugars. Starting back end of December, results are buried under the steroids effectiveness, so won’t know if it’s truly working until I finish the taper, but I do feel better for it (no bloating and much less gas). 

The other thing that also helped through that period was I had 2 IVs 2 weeks apart with vitamins in as I just wasn’t able to digest any energy/vitamins from my food so was super low energy.

Maybe 1 or 2 drops and never like visible in the toilet water. I also will pass moderate amounts of mucus once or twice a month, sometimes with stool, sometimes just on its own.

I’m currently 27. I’ve had several flares over the years. Been close to full remission a few times but never full on remission. Started on Lialda at 21 but switched to Humira at 26 and it really made a difference. Went from 7-8 BM a day to just 2-3. Urgency is almost all gone. Only trace amounts of blood every 3 months or so and then it goes away. But I’m thinking of stopping my treatment. 

Maybe you guys can talk me off the ledge or talk sense into me. Before I was put on Humira, my doctor warned me of the ultra rare hepatoslenic T-Cell Lymphoma, which occurs the most often in young men 20-35 on biologics with IBD. He told me I could get this rare form of cancer potentially even though it is pretty rare. Desperate for something to help me alleviate symptoms, I didn’t care and started treatment. 

But ever since then I’ve lived in fear, researching horror stories of that particular lymphoma and it’s basically instant death after a year. I constantly get blood work and everything has been fine except for the last 10 months my liver enzymes have been slightly elevated, which could be due to the Humira or the methotrexate I take with the Humira or my unhealthy diet, which I’m trying to change. 

I’m tired of living in fear of this cancer cloud hanging over me. It weighs on me almost daily. Colon cancer I can deal with. There’s a chance of beating it.  But with hepatoslenic T cell lymphoma there’s no chance. Am I crazy for wanting off this medicine and trying my luck with natural remedies, especially with my quality of life vastly improved? Am I freaking out over nothing? I’ve lurked on the board for a while but have never posted but I’m at my wits end and just need some fellow UCers to talk to about this because I’m sure some of you are taking Humira and are around 20-35. Maybe I’m just crazy but I’ll take the 7-8 BM a day and be miserable vs incurable insta-death cancer.",2020-01-22 10:53:28

Granted it's not something people go around broadcasting, thus I scour reddit haha. I personally have developed my own system for identifying flair ups along with a list of symptoms I look for to gauge the status of things, mostly stool observations. Anyways, I thought it could be helpful to get an example good day/bad day from people with UP to get an idea of where everyone is at. So I'll lead off:

Age: 30yrs oldDiet: Paleo dietDiagnosed: 3 years ago

**Good day:** Usually these are the days were I forget I even have an auto immune disease, sometimes I even think it's gone forever. Usually have 1-2 bowel movements a day, normal consistency, likely some slight evidence of blood on the outside. Not a lot, maybe just a streak. Very low stomach discomfort throughout the day, if any at all. All-in-all, feel ""normal"". During these stretches I will often come off the Canasa and see how long I can go without it.

**Bad day:** A variety of symptoms can be markers leading up to a bad day, mucus/blood in the stool are my primary. Bowel movements still usually stay at 1-2, maybe 3 on these days. Consistency is must more loose almost soft serve like (sorry), with shreds as well. Mucus much more present, almost looks like cotton or fuzz in the stool. Blood is also usually present but not aggressively. Very gasey, usually an hour after eating. I also begin noticing a very specific pain about 3-4 inches to the left of my belly button. It's not overwhelming, but noticeable. And usually when I notice it, gas follows along shortly after. Occasional ""I must go right now"" bowel movements.

When I notice evidence of a bad day, I tighten up my diet to strictly meat/veggies, focus on getting more sleep, double down on the probiotics ( morning and night), and become religious about the Canasa suppositories. Usually these stretches last 2-3 weeks. Intermittent fasting seems to help as well, but I'm new to demoing this so that's TBD.",2020-01-23 17:58:08

Just wanted to share my experience with lexapro:

I’ve had crohns/ colitis since 2014 and am currently on sulfasalazine 8 grams (daily) and lexapro 20mg daily 

I’ve recently been to my gastroenterologist and looked over my blood results to find that they were all normal - which has been a first for me

I haven’t had a flare for over 3 months, which is a great success for me as i’d previously relied heavily on prednisone 

It’s not a traditional treatment, but I’ve had some great results from taking the anti depressants 

I couldn’t get above 52kg, I’m 5’6 and 23- now I’m 60kg within a few months- I have more energy and obviously less stressed, as having colitis/ Crohn’s usually triggers anxiety and stress as you all know

Anyway, ask your doctor/ specialist if this would be appropriate for you to trial, it’s been great for me, and hopefully it can help you too",2020-01-24 01:56:51

I'm just having trouble understanding because when I saw my GI doc, he didn't give me a diagnosis but rather I saw the ""official diagnosis"" on the web portal that night. He didn't tell me to stay away from any foods and I had my first flare up a couple days ago and it was so incredibly bad from the pain, I had to go to the ER. I was vomiting and had terrible diarrhea, high fever, etc.  I had my gallbladder removed when I was.. 16? I think? And it was more painful than that. 

What can I not eat? I'm seeing things online that mostly say that it varies from person to person. Is there any sort of guideline? 

I'm also bipolar, and it's apparently not unheard of for UC and bipolar to go together. Doctors say the same thing about bipolar/aspergers, too. I'm just so confused on why all of this is happening to me.

I'm a new member and grateful for an outlet to share my experience so far.

I first started experiencing the symptoms an early October. It began with my BM rate increasing and the introduction of blood/mucus to my stools, which had become almost non-existent. 

It didn't get any worse so I dealt with it for a little over a month while trying to make intentional changes to my diet an order to alleviate the issue and return to normal.

But by Thanksgiving I started to experience the pain, muscle cramps, and fatigue. My brain was often in a fog and I wanted to take afternoon naps.

Again, I made adjustments to what I put in my body, tried to make morning stretching a habit again, and worked to counter-act the effects.

To no avail...

Going into December, I started working from home more often. I had no strength, no energy, and no appetite. I showed signs of significant weight loss. The contractions in my stomach muscles made toilet-time a hellish event and I would get lightheaded whenever I stood up.

Christmas morning found me in bed, unable to move. My insurance started on the 1st of the year, so I had to endure for 1 more week. Thankfully the insurance is through my partner so I didn't lose it when I lost my job. (Prolonged absence doesn't care about medical reasons)

Jan 3rd: I see my new PCP and tell her everything. She thinks it is diverticulitis due to lower left quadrant pain and my other described symptoms. Orders a slew of bloodwork and CT scan.

Jan 5th: CT Scan and bloodwork come back normal. PCP rules out Diverticulitis and sends me to a local GI for a colonoscopy.

Jan 14th: After a week of no-fiber, knot building in my belly and the torture of the prep at 2AM, I go in for my colonoscopy. I wake up to the GI telling me she was diagnosing me with severe ulcerative colitis and I needed an MRE to determine the severity (since she could only go a few inches without risk of damage due to the level of inflammation) Send me home with a script for 4.8gm (4 tablets) of mesalamine daily and a mesalamine enema nightly

Jan 15th: Follow up with PCP who says it's all in the GIs hands now

Today: MRE is scheduled for Feb 4th. Follow up with GI scheduled March 30th. I decided I want to be seen by the team at the Crohn's & Colitis Center at Mass General Hospital so I called the GIs office to have them fax over my info and a request. They begrudgingly agreed after 30mins of ""negotiations""

Now I sit and wait for the next appointment while trying not to give up.

Mornings are pure hell. My sphincter is on fire. My muscles ache constantly from dry-heaves of the butt. The concept of food is beyond frustrating. The pain is spreading to my right side. The enema has put me in diapers.

Not trying to be all complaints. I know you understand how it feels and don't need to be told how shitty it is. 

Thanks to everyone I've interacted with here already. Support really is so key to recovery.

Sending love,

Eric",2020-01-26 17:08:42

They know of my UC because about a year ago we ran into each other getting Remicaid. They get theirs for arthritis which they have had their whole life. I explained I get mine for UC, explaining some of what UC entails. 

A week ago they came to me concerned about some symptoms they are having. They basically explained a flair to me and said it had been going on for two months. I told them it was worth a call to their doctor. 

They call their doctor and are sent to the ER, for testing. I’m not really shocked by this, it was later in the day, and was sounded somewhat sever by the way they were describing it. Tests come back C-diff. 

At the same time I’m starting to go into a flair, sharing a work bathroom with this person. And I’m wondering do I contact my doctor for a stool sample to make sure mine really is flair and not C-diff? If they have had c-diff for two months since that’s how long they have had symptoms, what are the chances? Or am I just in my head now? I do admit C-diff is a nightmare of mine. 

TL:DR; co-worker has been sick for two months, knows I have UC asked for advise. I advised them to talk to their doctor turns out they have c-diff. We share a bathroom at work. Now I’m starting to flair, should I be concerned?",2020-01-26 17:03:44

I was diagnosed with UC in October 2019, after suffering from symptoms for approximately 2 months (blood/ mucus/ frequent trips to the bathroom etc.). I was told that whilst I didn’t have any ulcers, it was pancolitis.

I’m currently in a much better place and I’ve been off steroids for approximately 2-3 weeks. I don’t think my symptoms have got much worse, but I’d say that since going back to work after Christmas, my urgency increases immediately after I have a BM (so I’ve been trying my best to wait as long as possible to not go...). When I saw my doctor, he seemed to suggest I was now in remission and I’m now only taking 2.4g of mesasalizine a day. 

Anyway, my question is - is this really what my body in remission is like? I appreciate that we are all affected differently. 

I’m still going way more frequently than I did pre UC symptoms and I never had this level of urgency. I’m also still passing mucus (which also looks pink - I guess this means there’s is some bleeding).

Would total remission be a total return to this norm, or has my body now got a new “norm” now that I’ve had my first proper flare?

Hi everyone! my name is Varun Nagendra and I am a 21 year old senior enrolled at Youngstown State University. I am pursuing a biology major and degree in medicine. In March of 2018, I was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. At the time, I was in the spring semester of my junior year in college. What was thought to be only a minor health issue turned out to be nothing but. From these experiences, I couldn't help but come up with a solution for one of the dilemmas I had - I will explain that in a bit. To test my idea, I developed a brief 15 minute survey and see whether it is feasible or not.

I know surveys can be super annoying, especially when it is about something that may not even concern you. For that reason, I thought I would provide you with a brief backstory to not just explain the following survey, but to hopefully connect with you on a more personal level. If by the end of this intro you think these matters simply do not click with you or lack the appeal, you are more than welcome to go on with the rest of your beautiful day - I still thank you for hearing me out thus far :)

If you do choose to take this brief survey, I want to thank you for participating. Your feedback is sincerely appreciated. I understand how busy you probably are, so I am grateful you chose to dedicate some of your precious time to answering these questions. I have posted the link at the bottom of this post :)

Note: The survey contains the same backstory that I have provided below, so no need to read both!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of today, there is no permanent cure to ulcerative colitis. Instead, there are only a variety of treatments to make the disease tolerable for patients, with the end goal being remission - a stage in which the disease and clinical symptoms subside. 

Secondly, the disease is very inconsistent in nature. The same disease can manifest in anyone, anywhere, at anytime, for any reason - and it can go away just as mysteriously. Furthermore, the SAME condition may present DIFFERENT clinical symptoms across multiple patients. For instance, between two individuals with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, one may experience bloody stools and incontinence while another may only feel abdominal pain and cramping - of course, every symptom varies by degree and no symptom is mutually exclusive.

So what options do such patients have? Well the most tried and true method out there is a colectomy, during which a part of, or the whole colon is removed. Typically, this is performed as a last resort and in extreme cases, where no other treatment options have proven to be effective. Unfortunately, I seem to fall into this category - more on this in a bit.

So what options are out there? Well...pretty much anything if you have an open mind. Standard procedure usually entails treatment via a class of medications known as biologics (Humira, Entyvio, Simponi, and Stellara are some examples). Supplemental or temporary methods of relief may include steroids, 5-ASAs, Acetaminophen, exercise regiments (or lack thereof), yoga, meditation, mindfulness, acupuncture, homeopathy, and much more. But probably the most significant supplemental treatment method is **diet and nutrition.**

Just like all other treatments, the diet best for one patient may not be best for another. However, researchers have been able to roughly identify some of the types of foods that tend to cause further issues for most colitis patients. Some examples include the typical list of unhealthy ingredients like sugar, fats, and cholesterol. But many problematic foods are not on such a list - these include spices, vegetables with high fiber, lactose products and even fruits due to their acidic nature. But as with all things in life, there are exceptions, perhaps even more so in this scenario. One patient may be able to tolerate fibers perfectly fine while another would end up in the restroom within minutes.

However, one thing all these patients face? A dietary restriction in one way, shape, or form. More often than not, it is enough to not just be an inconvenience, but a complete nightmare, capable of changing lifestyles. This could be socially, mentally, athletically, educationally, or even religiously.

At this time in my life, one of the more severely impacted areas from my disease was my education. Now, its no mystery that diet is not exactly the most maintained part of a typical college student's life, let alone a student with excessive dietary requirements. I can personally attest to the fact that all those rumors you hear?...well...let's just say they can be true ;) We HAVE eaten cereal for dinner, we HAVE skipped breakfast if we are late to class, we HAVE skipped meals if we aren't hungry, and we HAVE eaten Ramen noodles or fast food five nights in a row. Now, obviously this is nowhere near healthy for a regular student, but for an ulcerative colitis patient? It simply isn't sustainable. 

After my diagnosis, each day that passed, my disease worsened. What originally started with occasional bloody stools, turned into always bloody stools, which turned into, 2-3 more bowel movements, which eventually became 8+ movements of nothing but blood, incontinence, and the inability to digest food or absorb nutrients. After a year had passed, I was beginning to lose weight and energy. My attendance rate plummeted to nearly 50%, which in turn increased stress, which would worsen my condition further. Nonetheless, I continued to self-study and force myself to keep up with my classes anyway (bad idea). By then, I was so fatigued, I didn't have the energy to buy or get food, let alone make it. I scoured online for any solution, and all I found were directions, rules, tips, and recipes - none of which mattered if I didn't have the energy to follow them.

Fast forward another 6 months and I began developing severe abdominal pain, to the point that I was admitted to the emergency room on three separate occasions. I was cumulatively in the hospital for about 20 days, which was more than enough for me to fall behind the point of no return. Catching up would be impossible and so I had no choice but to pursue an emergency gap year.

By November 2019, I was under my parents' care at home - which is where I am writing this from today. To date, my condition has limited improvement, mainly due to - you guessed it - diet. I no longer have to make my own food or stress about what to eat or force myself to consume something that is as good as poison. Thanks to my mother, we have established a rough food log, and she is able to adjust her cooking to AT LEAST sustain my condition. For this, I am grateful because I know many do not have such a support system.

Now, am I on the road to recovery? Not even close. Currently, we still have not found a feasible treatment that works for me. I am on my third biologic, and nowhere near remission. Unfortunately, the daunting thought of surgery seems to be more and more likely to become a reality. But I have more time. I may not be getting better but I am no longer getting worse. I am stable. I am not in agonizing pain. I can function. I can write this, what was supposed to be a brief, introduction - sorry! 

With all this said and done, I couldn't help but wonder that maybe had I been on my mom's diet earlier, my disease wouldn't have gotten so bad. Maybe if I had the access to a diet suitable for my condition in college, it would have given my medications a better shot of working.

With all this said and done, I couldn't help but wonder that maybe had I been on my mom's diet earlier, my disease wouldn't have gotten so bad. Maybe if I had the access to a diet suitable for my condition in college, it would have given my medications a better shot of working.

But the past is the past right? Wrong. Well...maybe for me it is. After all, I am back home under as-perfect-as-can-be conditions. But what about for everyone else? Not just people with ulcerative colitis, but everyone who has been diagnosed with a medical condition that limits their dietary freedom. Everyone who simply needs one less thing to worry about. And then I remembered. There are plenty of meal services online right? The first one that came to mind was Blue Apron. You can go online, choose a meal plan for you, and have fresh ingredients delivered right to your front door - especially with the recent development of so many delivery services (Grubhub, DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc).

After more digging, I could see some of the restricted dietary options available...but only for the most popular restrictions (some may even argue they are lifestyle choices). These include lactose free, gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, and so forth. But what about vegetarians who can't eat fiber? Or lactose intolerant individuals who can still eat cheese? These two examples both highlight the dietary inconsistencies brought about by so many medical conditions. Inconsistencies that I was never able to find to be accounted for in modern day meal services. Furthermore, many such companies ship you ingredients, meaning you still have to make the meal yourself - which does no good to a patient who is stressed, fatigued, and/or busy.

Which brings me to this survey. The survey is designed as a market researching questionnaire that allows me to analyze the thoughts, opinions, concerns, and demands that patients like me have. But maybe I could be wrong. Maybe I am just a one-of-a-kind case and no one else feels the same way. Maybe there is a meal service out there that has already addressed this issue. Maybe there are some logistics that are simply just not feasible. At the same time, maybe there are others like me. Not just college students but anyone - a mother who is fatigued from a condition and still has to take care of her kids or a husband who has no lunch options at work. Maybe this is something we could all use. Most importantly, maybe this idea is something that can be the difference between a quick medical recovery and ending up in the OR. This survey is designed to test all these concerns. 

Oh and one last thing, I promise :)

At the end of the survey is a brief contact form to provide me with your name, email, and phone number. Providing this info is completely voluntary and will not be seen by anyone but me. The reason for this info is simply for me to provide you with, if you choose, statistical information about survey results. Additionally, **if** by some chance the demand is high enough and this project takes off, I can provide you with updates, information, and perhaps SOME day, even discounts/rewards for helping me begin this journey :)

Once again, I would like to thank you so much for taking the time to read this far. Also, whether you choose to complete this survey or not, I wish you the best of luck with your health and future endeavors. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at [vnagendraphotography@gmail.com](mailto:vnagendraphotography@gmail.com).

Wine and beer (hard liquor like vodka, gin, whiskey I handle well).

Spicy food

Fried food (when eaten alot over the course of multiple days)

Milk (but any other cheese, yogurt or heavy cream is fine. Just pasteurized milk by itself sometimes gives me bad times. Sometimes it doesn't.

I’m thinking about trying IF as a way to get myself a little healthier than I am right now. I’m wondering if anyone else has any experience with IF.

Some background: Im 34 years old, and I’ve been managing my UC since I was about 20. My UC is in remission about 90-95% of my life, through a combination of medication and lifestyle choices. 

Part of those lifestyle choices are me being a carboholic. My body seems to love having carbs go through, as long as they aren’t super oily or greasy. It seems to help me stay in remission, but it also means that I gain weight more than I would otherwise prefer. I’ve been looking at ways to lose weight, and I’ve come across IF.

As I browsed some IF information, I noticed many people talking about how it can reduce inflammation for people who have digestive issues. So I’d like to know: has anyone here tried doing IF? If so, have you noticed any improvements in inflammation? 

I have an appt with my GI in May, so I’ll discuss the idea with him at that point. Just wanted to hear some anecdotal evidence first.  Thanks!",2020-01-27 20:05:04

I was recently diagnosed with mild uc in October. When I first started having symptoms I went to my gastroenterologist and was told it was hemorrhoids. They told me three banding sessions and I would be back to normal. Well long story short after my second banding session I went to the east coast for work and half way through my trip had a flare up. 

I didn't know what it was at the time but looking back that's definitely what it was. Came back and talked to my dr. Who was like we are signing you up for a colonoscopy. After that I was told I needed to do a pill camera to determine if it was uc or chrons. After dropping 3000 dollars in a month was told it was a mild case of uc. I was put on the maximum dose of oral mesalamine. I was feeling better and life was starting to settle down till December. 

I started to progressively get worse and worse again. I was told not to worry and that a steroid would solve the issue. They put me on the maximum dose of budesonide. I started having lots of side effects but was told it was annoying but not something for me to worry about. After a month on them I'm still not better and now my dr has pulled a 180. He is acting like I'm not taking my medication every day because he says I have a mild case and should be getting better. He gave me three weeks to get better or he is putting me on biologics. 

He won't really explain what all is involved with it leaving me to research on my own. I ended up trying inflammation supplements as well as probiotics and bpc 157 shots. Doing all this daily and am still having issues. I'm just frustrated because the only symptoms I have are lose stool and blood. I only go once a day though and don't have any abdominal pain. I'm just frustrated that nothing seems to be helping. Ive tried diet recommendations form a diet specialist but that hasn't helped. Sorry for the huge long vent I'm just very frustrated. I just want to feel better.",2020-01-27 17:44:50

5673,"UC is a polymicrobial biofilm attacking the gut wall, not a chronic auto-immune disease CMV",ital-is-vital,11,ev3r13,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ev3r13/uc_is_a_polymicrobial_biofilm_attacking_the_gut/,18,"TL;DR: My SO was diagnosed with UC several years ago and was on azothioprene and topical mesalazine / 5-ASA, but they didn't really work and she'd had active disease for about 18mo. I read a bunch of scientific papers to learn about UC. After a while I started reading about polymicrobial biofilms. Within two weeks of starting an approach aimed at breaking up biofilms she noticed a difference, after two months she had symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Fluke?

ELI5: A bacteria and a fungus work together to create a slimy haven for themselves on the surface of the gut just out of reach of the immune system. As a result the immune system goes crazy trying desperately to fight the infection, and the rest of the body gets harmed in the process.

\---

It all started with this article in 'Medical News Today' -- [""New IBD treatments may combine antifungals and probiotics""](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319633.php). That linked to this [key scientific paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28988727) that changed my understanding what UC (and Crohn's) fundamentally are -- a bacteria and a fungus working together to attack the gut wall.

The common view both on this forum and amongst doctors seems to be that UC is a chronic auto-immune disease like diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis where the immune system is attacking the body for no reason. This assumption seems to be wrong. There **are** genetic and environmental risk factors too and some of these risk factors are with you for life, but the root cause of active disease seems to be potentially treatable directly, rathe than just reducing symptoms using immune-supressing drugs. There are too many 'bad' micro-organisms in the body, and when their population is reduced by competing 'good' microbes the immune system goes back to normal.

The biofilm seems to actually consume sugar from the blood and white blood cells for food, which is why taking immunuospressants helps with the symptoms. But it's **not** simply an auto-immune disease, and it can't be cured by immune-suppressing drugs even though they take away the worst of the symptoms.

This makes sense of a bunch of things:

* Why UC looks like **patches** of redness of the gut wall, and why the disease progresses slowly as the patches get bigger -- the biofilm can only grow from its edges. Outside of the area protected by the biofilm the fungus and the bacteria can's survive.
* Why in many cases the initial trigger for UC is either food poisoning or smoking cessation. Both of these cause sudden changes in gut microflora that lead to long-lasting 'dysbiosis' -- i.e. having the [wrong balance of gut bacteria and fungi](https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/66/6/1039.full.pdf). In the case of smoking cessation it's because nicotine is a potent anti-fungal that kills beneficial fungi, but also keeps pathogenic fungi in check. When the nicotine is taken away the pathogenic fungi are able to grow without any beneficial fungi to compete with.
* Why [probiotics on their own induce remission](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/Abstract/2005/07000/VSL_3_Probiotic_Mixture_Induces_Remission_in.20.aspx)... because some probiotics [have the ability to break up biofilms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6456750/)
* Why anti-fungals (nicotine, curcumin / turmeric, cinnamon, garlic) seem to affect UC and CD.
* Taken together the previous two points explain why UC is less common in countries that include more fermented foods and more natural anti-fungals in their diets (e.g., India)
* Why inflammatory diseases run in families -- you inherit both your microbiome and your genome from your parents.
* Why even though it's a conventional disease in the sense that it's caused by a pathogenic microorganism it's not a *transmissible* disease. The pathogens involved are everywhere and in every person, it's actually the lack of certain microorganisms that's the problem.
* Why FMT and probiotics work -- it's the absence of microorganisms that would normally compete with E.Coli, C.Albicans/Tropicalis and S.Marascens that cause the disease state.

&#x200B;

So how do you get rid of a biofilm? In short, you do exactly as the original article suggests and combine an anti fungal and a probiotic. Here was what seemed to work for us:

* Take a good probiotic, we used VSL #3 ('Visbiome' in the US). Several of the bacteria in this mix have the ability to [invade and break up biofilms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6456750/). This went in a fruit smoothie every day. Kefir and unpasteurised sauerkraut a bonus, but there are certain specific strains of bacteria you need and I don't think 'natural' sources alone are enough.
* Add as much anti-fungals to your diet as you can. We used 400mg/d of curcumin + piperene extract, and then also added loads of cinnamon, ginger, garlic and turmeric to food. All of these things are anti-fungal and they work better together than separately.
* Cut anything from your diet that raises your blood sugar  No sugar, no large meals of simple carbs except after exercise, no artificial sweeteners, no fruit juices. Starve the bastards by avoiding blood sugar peaks.
* Generally avoid eating anything which is easy food for opportunistic microorganisms, or which causes bloating or fermentation in the gut. Make sure that your large intestine is a low-nutrient environment. Lentils, veg, white meat, eggs, whole fruits all seem to be good, especially if combined with natural anti-fungals. I made a lot of curry.
* Eliminate any food triggers that may be exacerbating auto-immunity -- cow milk, wheat, onions and capsicums are common culprits. r/AutoImmuneProtocol
* Don't smoke. Nicotine kills beneficial fungi so even though it reduces symptoms in the short term by killing everything, in the long run you need to cultivate the proper balance of fungi and in that respect it's unhelpful.
* No caffeine (or chocolate). Speeds up gut transit which is really unhelpful because bile acid ends up in the large intestine. it may also impair insulin sensitivity leading to bigger blood sugar peaks.
* Do some reasonably intense exercise a couple of times a week. This relates to blood sugar and also to improving circulation.
* Take a good multivitamin that contains selenium, zinc and lots of b-vitamins. IBD creates chronic malabsorption of micronutrients and selenium happens to be important for the biofilm thing.

The mesalazine and azothioprene were continued for the first month. The mesalazine was stopped after symptoms of an active flare had stopped. Currently tapering the azothioprene slowly to see if that's still needed.

Is this 'remission or a 'cure'? It depends whether you can stop taking probiotics and the gut microbiome stays stable so long as a good diet is maintained. We haven't tried that yet because the cost of the probiotics is trivial compared to shitting blood multiple times a day.

I'd love to see more people try this approach out so we can see if it works consistently, or whether this was just chance. If you try this approach please post in the comments and say if you noticed anything. Same goes if you tried this approach already and it didn't work.",2020-01-28 11:13:40

At this time I was flaring really bad and when I had to go I REALLY had to go. I was driving home from my boyfriends apartment one night (literally less than a five minute drive) when I suddenly had the urgent need to go to the bathroom.

I panicked and turned into a church parking lot, desperately hoping it was unlocked. (And hey if it wasn’t unlocked I could always go in the bushes right?) I rushed to the doors and to my relief they were open! But even though I had made it into the building as I hurried down the halls I couldn’t make it to the bathroom.

I straight up crapped my pants in the middle of some random church. I continued to the bathroom to clean up and ended up just cutting my losses and throwing the leggings I was wearing into the trash. I tried texting/calling my boyfriend and roommates to bring me a new pair of pants but no one answered! I was trapped in a church bathroom naked from the waist down.

Luckily I was wearing a long jacket over my shirt and I swallowed my pride and wrapped it around my waist. It covered me enough and I walked out of the bathroom hoping no one would see me. I snuck back out to my car and drove the rest of the way home feeling so incredibly embarrassed. One of my worst nightmares had happened! 

Looking back on it now it is actually really funny to me. I hope that you guys can find humor in your UC. And remember, everyone craps their pants sometimes 😂",2020-01-28 05:23:48

I've... never has this problem before, lol. Does this happen to anyone else? I'm afraid of taking a stool softener or miralax (was told to take this yesterday) as I guess I just have this fear of it triggering the pain/poops. 

As a side note, I just switched back to two SSRIs that I was taken off of last week (bipolar, feeling a bit depressed lately due to UC diagnosis i assume) that I had switched to something new... apparently they inhibit pain? And all these years I've been taking them they've been muting the pain I've been having, and I thought I was legitimately dying on Sunday.",2020-01-30 21:51:04

I was pretty anemic as well. The intense cost of Lialda and Budesonide lead me astray and I haven’t followed up on the medical side of things since around that time.

I’ve been living with daily urgency and explosive liquid shits, cramping (or maybe intense gas pains), and lactose intolerance. Mornings and the worst. I said enough is enough and started researching probiotics. I came across S. boulardii, a unique and hardy probiotic yeast, which piqued my interest because bacterial probiotics have never really helped me much. Four days in and I’m no longer having irregular muddy/liquid shits, they are the expected soft serve consistency that a bowel movement should be. I don’t know if I cracked some universal code, but it’s been working for me and for that I am grateful.

Then what?  Xeljanz is basically my last option and that will either not work or work just fine but only until it doesn't...so it sounds like having my colon removed is inevitable which is depressing. 

I'm thinking about asking my doctor for another medicine to take in addition to my entyvio but I believe in entyvio and I'm trying to stick it out.

I’m 52 years old now. I was first diagnosed with UC when I was about 23 years old. I lived in Toronto at the time. 

It went into remission for many years and it would flare up slightly once in awhile and then quiet down again. I was young and naive looking back and didn’t take it seriously. When I was around 30, it was flaring up more and more but not enough to catch my attention to take it seriously. I was in a hectic job, had young kids, and life was busy. I did notice I was winded easily but chalked it up to being out of shape. I was overweight and not active. Someone at work one day commented to me that I looked tired and jaundiced. This caught my attention and I went to the doctor. Long story short, I was severely anemic. Doctor said my hemoglobin was so low, he was amazed that I was able to walk around and function, but theorized that my deterioration had been slow and gradual, that I had adapted to it. 

They put me on Lialda and this got things under control for years again and I forgot about it, and took things for granted again. 

Around 2008, I got a severe case of diarrhea around Thanksgiving and went to see the  doctor. They gave me an antibiotic which I had an allergic reaction to. That Christmas, I found myself in the hospital with UC raging, C Diff, and “toxic megacolon”. I was given a high dosage of prednisone which spiked my blood sugar and kicked me into diabetes. 

Several years of trying prednisone, humera, remicade, and other things, nothing was helping long term. I was going to the bathroom every 2 hours and shit my pants too many times. It was hell and my gastroenterologist suggested many times to have my colon removed but I still resisted because I was scared of the thought of it. In 2012, a severe case of Pyoderma gangrenosum broke out on my legs. Look it up if you don’t know what that is, but it was horrible  and possibly a side effect of Remicade for me. I also had psoriasis and my finger nails were falling out of my fingers. I was a huge mess and was probably depressed mentally. 

My gastroenterologist got me into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN fall of 2012. I lived in Minneapolis at the time so it was close by. They were awesome. They put me on a treatment plan for the pyoderma and UC which helped me very quickly. I was put on a treatment plan of tracolimus and methotrexate for my UC which quieted my colitis for years to come, until lab tests showed it was damaging my kidneys and liver.

My gastroenterologist at this time suggested I try Entyvio. This was a few years ago and I was terrified of potential side effects. At this time , the pyoderma had healed up on my legs (I have terrible permanent scars to remind me of it though), psoriasis cleared up, and finger nails grew back. I was getting active again and was losing lots of weight and getting healthier in all ways. 

Entyvio has been awesome for me though. I get an infusion every 8 weeks and take lialda daily. I’ve gotten into running, biking, and weight lifting. I do some kind of exercise everyday and have lost a total of 75 lbs of weight and I’m in the best physical condition of my life (knock on wood). My diabetes is under control with maintenance medication and I don’t have to take insulin anymore for it. 

I know some of you might be going through some dark times and offer my story as hope that it can get better. Of course everyone is different and what worked for me may not work for someone else. 

If anyone has questions, I’m happy to try to answer.",2020-01-30 02:07:32

First time posting, but I am needing advice if anyone has it. I was diagnosed with pancolitis back in August of 2018 and have had a hell of a time since then. 

I break out in a rash with sulpha drugs so my doctor said 5-ASAs were off the table, and my doctor said the other options were not good for a male in my age range, so we had to jump straight to Humira. I was on it once every two weeks for about 6 months after taking prednisone for around 3 months right after diagnosis (which did seem to get me back to normal until I started the taper to more than half), but then a follow-up colonoscopy said the inflammation was still there and my blood work said the Humira was not lasting the full two weeks between doses. He put me on once a week, and honestly, I have felt better. The urgency went down, I didn't have pain and issues as much and generally felt better. Things started getting a little worse around the fall of 2019, but they still weren't nearly as bad as when I was undiagnosed. Cue this week when I had another colonoscopy to check on progress, and my doctor told me it looked worse than the last time. He is giving me prednisone again for a month, and we are going to discuss medication options in two weeks, but I am just disheartened. I don't know what to do. I don't understand how I feel so much better but have such active disease. He said it doesn't look like it was just a flare-up but consistent active disease. 

Alright, with my life story out of the way, has anyone with sulpha issues tried 5-ASA drugs? I really don't want to move up the pyramid of drugs and run out of options for treatment, but I am also worried about the effects consistent inflammation will have on my colon in the long run.",2020-01-31 22:42:49

I had come to terms with changing to infusion of stronger medications when I got a call from my doctor saying that insurance will not cover anything unless I try Humera first, and my choices I had finally been given were taken away.

So for those people, and others who might be interested, I would like to share my experience.

&#x200B;

In 2017 I got really sick, at the time I was not yet diagnosed with UC. My general practitioner (GP) diagnosed me with a virus, and told me I would be fine in 2 weeks. After \~1 week my mom took me to the ER because there was blood in my stool, they told us the same thing as my GP (not even checking my stool). After 1 more week of excruciating pain my mom took me to the ER again, this time however they took one look at me and told me I would be admitted.

&#x200B;

They treated me with prednisone and infliximab, but it was too little too late. I had a full colectomy with an Ileostomy. After 3 months in hospital I could finally go home, physical and mentally broken. Luckily the hospital provided me with a therapist and I recovered swiftly.

&#x200B;

I lived me life and even went back to school after a few months. My gastroenterologist told me that, since the Ileostomy made a big impact on my self-esteem, a J-pouch might be an option. I decided to go for it. During the surgery there were complications (fistulas). After they fixed that I had to wait 3 more months with a new Ileostomy, only this one was much worse and kept causing leaks.

&#x200B;

The second surgery went without a hitch, and here I am now \~10 months later.  I had to quit school, my condition is not that great, and I am currently struggling with fistulas (which will either result in surgery or infliximab). So I am still very much in battle with my body, my gastroenterologist even suggested it could be Chron's (which would be awful).

&#x200B;

But even all of this my J-pouch has given me the life an Ileostomy never could. I feel fine most of the time, and there are even moment of happiness. I can go out with friends, eat everything I want, don't have to worry about leakage, and feel quite comfortable.

&#x200B;

I do feel time pressure, my friends are still in school and/or getting jobs. But when I think about it, it is not that bad. I am confident I will be able to make it out there, even with the small skill set that I acquired in my short years of school. I have been doing some freelance work, and I like what I do. I hope that in a year or 5 I will be as functional as I can be.

&#x200B;

I have been trough hell and back. Of course I left some of the negative parts out (like having a bad trip on ketamine after my first surgery), those things matter not since they no longer impact me.

But this is not true. You are sure to be happy again. Knowing this, truly believing it will make you less miserable now. I have had enough experience to make this statement.

I've had 3 hospitalizations, 2 quite long and back to back. I've lost a bunch of weight, I'm on TPN through a picc line and have a homecare nurse, I had to move back in with my parents and obviously can't work. 

I've run through every medication and after my last hospitalization they put me on Xeljanz and it was my last hope. Xeljanz dropped my hemoglobin from 10 to 7.5 and my GI called me in and pulled me off of it because it's unsafe. Amidst this, in the past week I've been having fevers and more (very watery) diarrhea and more pain, but other than that I had been doing relatively better and adding in more foods and gaining weight. When I get fevers my heartrate gets up to 135, which is what would happen in the hospital. My resting heartrate in this flare stays at like 110. I thought I had C. diff again because of this but the test was negative so all of this was just an increase in symptoms. 

My GI said Stelara may be an option soon (I literally just read it got FDA approval so I'm going to ask him about it). I'm tapering on Prednisone so he told me to stop where I am at 20mg. So right now I'm on no meds except 20mg of pred and I'm dealing with an increase of symptoms and I feel like I'm hanging in the balance, waiting for.... something? I MAY be able to go on a lower dose of Xeljanz if my hemoglobin goes up but we aren't sure.

He's referring me to a specialist GI a state away for another opinion. My GI didn't mention surgery, but the GIs (that are a part of the same group) that I saw in the hospital kept bringing it up. At this point I've gotten opinions from at least 5 GIs when you consider the ones I saw in the hospital, and at least 2 of those saw me for extended periods and were amazing. 

I'm just scared of only being on 20mg of pred and nothing else. I'm also upset that my last hope ended up being unsafe because I feel like it was helping somewhat, even if it was doing so slowly. I feel like I'm heading for surgery and it makes me sad. I had 10 years of near normalcy on Humira and I miss those days. 

I didn't think I'd be 28 living with my parents, having not even started my career. I had to medically withdraw from my master's program, and I have a bachelors in microbiology that I haven't been able to use because I've just stayed sick for so long. I celebrated my 28th birthday right out of the hospital with candles stuck in some raspberry sorbet because I couldn't eat anything.

 I'm fairly new to this subreddit, although I've been diagnosed with UC for just under a year now. I'm 21 years old, and was diagnosed just before my 21st birthday last year. I've tried and failed remicade, and have since switched to Entyvio which I'm just about finished the ""loading doses"" before I go onto once every 8 weeks.

 Does anyone have some insight with their own experience with Entyvio? I've heard it can take a little bit to fully kick in.

 Also, does anyone have some suggestions of anything else I can take that they've found to help reduce inflammation?

 Thank you",2019-11-01 07:53:59

5730,14 Years of Hell,BadApple-13,22,dqg0rf,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/dqg0rf/14_years_of_hell/,7,"Apologies if I'm not suppose to post here (since I'm not being medicated anymore and I've had my surgeries years ago) but I just found this place and I'd honestly just like to share my experience thus far with UC (because I don't typically share it since it's long...and sucks).

Now my memory isn't the best, so dates and ages might be off, but I can still clearly remember the date I had to be pulled out of public school: November 26th, 2005 (5th Grade) in Mission, BC. I left before recess even started, I heard from my sister that day no one even noticed I was gone. I don't remember when exactly I was first admitted into the hospital, all I remember was that it wasn't as immediate as it should have been.

I was 11 years old when we were told I had ""Undetermined Colitis"", something we knew nothing about.

Cue the months of looking through web article after web article to learn more about what might have caused it and what to do. But since this was 2005-2006, there wasn't much out there. I spent my 12th birthday (April 13th, 2006), sitting on the couch and not being allowed to have any of the cake, pop, or chips all my other family members were allowed (my Mum didn't have any because she felt bad for me). During this time, I was on medications, but they were doing nothing for me. I was only getting worse and worse (constantly throwing up whatever I ate, hair falling out, paling even more, pain, weight loss, ect). At one point, I couldn't have anything other than Carnation Instant Breakfast mixed with soy milk.

A week after my birthday (April 20th, 2006), I had to be admitted into the hospital again after I woke up and couldn't stop shaking. My Mum had to argue with my own father to take us to Vancouver to the hospital. He only agreed to take us as far as Abbotsford.

I really hated being in the hospital.

Because I was so sick, they had trouble getting an IV in me. I'd cry every time they came in to try again, it took hours before they could get one in me (they tried every spot they could, in both arms). But during that time, I guess my Mum and them agreed to transfer me to Vancouver Children's Hospital and that had been my first (and so far, only) time in an ambulance. I remember the two ambulance attendees were very nice, the lady complimented the pink bear I had with me.

For the rest of April and part of May, things were going pretty smoothly. I wasn't in pain, I gained more weight. Things were looking up (note: my father was looking after my siblings during this time, his boss let him leave work with pay until I could return home), we celebrated my Mum's birthday (May 19th 2006) which a couple of nurses gave her some flowers. I was thinking that I would finally get to go home soon!

Then, a few days later, my large intestine burst. 

I was rushed to emergency and I learned a month after I was able to return home that my heart stopped 4 times in the ICU. My colon, which had been described to me looking like ""hamburger and bubble wrap"", turned out to be a toxic megacolon. They said if I wasn't in the hospital that night, I would have died. I remember waking up, before knowing what happened or what was going on, feeling absolutely guilty that I put my Mum through that. I  knew she would be upset and that's something that will always kill me inside.

Of course, things weren't better after that, some of the things still affect me to this day (though I'm slowly getting over them). I had to go through physio because I couldn't move my legs (I collapsed to the floor when they said it was okay for me to get out of bed), I still walk with a slight limp. Because I was very depressed from everything, they sent a therapist to my room whenever my Mum wasn't in the room and she would talk to me like I was slow and stupid (I just started seeing a therapist for a different issue but I confessed to her my immense discomfort with therapist and physiogists because of it, she's being super understanding). My surgical scar got infected and they had to reopen it, use adhesive ties to keep it closed while it healed (as revenge, I told them I wanted my staples so 3 old dudes were digging them out of the bin), I'm now super self-conscious about my appearance because of my scar (from below the sternum to my hips). I have a fear of needles and I can't help but to cry when I'm in discomfort (ex: I can't be aware while doing a scope because of my anxiety). I can't have certain foods and drinks (like jello and apple juice) because I will throw it up, having literally only had that for a month and a half. 

It was some time after my little brother's birthday (June 17th, 2006) I was finally allowed out of the hospital. We had a nurse come to our home to change the dressing (the incision was still healing up) and to go through physio. But again, things weren't just suddenly better. And this is where the family complications get added into the mess. 

First off, my father crashes the van in the hospital parking lot. The night I'm admitted out. While it was raining. Luckily, no one was hurt but we lost our van. Second, my father refused to have us covered by medical for my supplies, which meant we had to budget $75 every 2 weeks when we barely had enough for food. Third, we learned I had sensitive skin since the adhesive on the ostomy disks was literally eating at my skin (but we only had so many options for concaved disks that didn't just last me half a day). Fourth, my father ridiculed me to his friends about having to wear a ""poop bag"" when I was already feeling like a literal piece of shit.

But probably the worst, and what was one of the deciding factors in my parents eventual divorce, was that my own father refused for me to go back to the hospital so I could begin having my reconnection surgeries, knowing for a fact how miserable I was. From 11 years, up until I was 17 years old, I had to wear something that caused me so much pain and suffering that it drove me deep into depression. The only reason I never even considered killing myself was because, again, I knew it would upset my Mum and I held onto that love for her like it was a lifesaver (which it was, to be honest).

We left him when I was 15 (and learned in my first appointment in years that I actually had Ulcerative Colitis), I had the first reconnection surgery (a J pouch) when I was 16 (during which my Mum made friends with someone who would later become my Stepdad). The last reconnection surgery to close up everything was when I was 17 (it took a while because I was back in public school, a year behind because of moving but grade 10 was still one of my favorite schooling years). I was admitted out of the hospital on Father's Day during the last surgery, I remember this because my father decides to phone my Mum and asked to talk to me, only for him to tell me how he was going to kill himself because we weren't there and he missed us (I was crying/begging him to stop and my Mum had to take the phone away from me). 

Things were fine up until grade 11, when we had to rush to emergency because my small intestine decided to come out of my body. I remember I had a socials final that day, I remember the doctor saying I would have to wear an ostomy again (for the rest of my life). Next thing I remember, I'm waking up in a room and looking for my phone to text my Mum, I see her messages explaining everything (telling the school and my friends what was going on and that the surgery went great). I remember lifting up my hospital gown and seeing the gauze and tape and no ostomy, ""Oh...nice...I'm hungry...""

Turns out I started to get hysterical and they tranquilized me.

Funniest part of that experience was returning to school, looking for my social teacher and watching his face drain when I asked about the test I missed, ""The test? I just gave you 100%, I don't want you to stress!""

Honestly, things kinda felt normal for a while. I had friends, I had a boyfriend (I'm single again though), my Mum was happy. I graduated high school, got a job, worked hard and I continue working hard. But no issues involving my UC up until this year in March, I had to leave work early and be admitted into the hospital because of a narrowing in my small intestine. They said they found some irritation but it wasn't anything to worry about (because I wasn't in pain or had any symptoms after having the narrowing stretched and put on meds for a week). I have a scope in December.

Which I hope will bring good news.

But that's my story, that's my own experience with everything. I know it's a lot but I just wanted to share something I don't get to share with many people. Most just don't understand the struggle I had to go through to be where I am now (not that I'm in the best place but I'm not in a bad place either). I don't know if anyone will actually care but...I don't know, it feels good to share.

Anyways, good luck to everyone who is going through a difficult time. I wish you all the best.",2019-11-02 06:20:48

I did go to my gp with this but at the time i wasnt having any symptoms (because they often occur in the evening and clear by morning) and she has no idea either, all the urine testing came back clear.

Not sure what to do cos its so painful whenever i get it id almost rather be in a flare cos then id know the culprit behind the symptoms.

I just found that my most recent result came back normal. While I'm relieved about finding out that the result is good and technically in remission, I have mixed emotions about this. I'm left with this disturbing feeling of uncertainty for what's to come in the future on top of the depression that I'm experiencing ever since being hit with this diagnosis. It's unfortunate that these negative feelings are still plaguing me because I feel like I should be celebrating or feeling really happy about this. I don't feel as much positive emotion, to be honest.

After more than a decade of doctors telling me my symptoms were probably just hemorrhoids, I had my first major flare up that led to impressively quick weight loss, and bowls full of blood and nastiness... Needless to say, after stubbornly telling myself that I probably just had the flu for two weeks, my wife forced me to go the the ER.  I literally had no strength to argue or attempt to be stupidly “manly” anymore.

Well, after a cat scan I learned about this glorious disease.  After a colonoscopy a few weeks later, I was confirmed to have severe ulcerative colitis.  Thankfully no signs of anything worse like cancer of Crohn’s.

Fast forward 2 months later, I’m still mostly bed bound, even after taking a combination of prednisone, mesalamine, and iron every day.  Thankfully those did help me gain some weight back, and the bleeding isn’t nearly as bad.  The pain is still rather intense though.

My G.I. is starting me on Humira in about a week, and I’m a bit nervous about it.  I’ve read mostly positive reviews about it, but having a severely weakened immune system is a bit intimidating to me.  The few really bad reviews I read were mostly from people who got really sick from illnesses that wouldn’t be an issue for those with a normal immune systems.  The flu is suddenly the terminator.

I guess my question is... how worried should I be about small things like going out to public places, or shaking peoples hands?  Is it something I need to avoid?  Should I wear masks at the store?  Will having pets in the house be problematic?  Or is it less of a big deal than I’m making it?

I know the steroids already lowered my immune system, but I haven’t gotten any illnesses as a result of that, but Humira seems to be it’s own monster lol.

If anyone could help answer that'd be great!   

   
One of the first things he mentioned is that the ulcerative inflammation is only in the first 4 cm, making it proctitis. However there is inflammation in different parts along the colon that he said could later develop into UC. Does anyone know how likely it is that may develop into UC?   
  
Also when I asked him if there was any way to prevent it from spreading/getting worse, he said ""it's an auto-immune disease"" so I'm guessing that's a no? 
  
Last thing I brought up was dietary concerns, to which he said my diet wont have any effect unless I start having consistent diarrhea in which case the FODMAPS diet could help with that.  
  
So basically I'm due back in a year to have another colonoscopy and check on those other spots of inflammation, and I didn't leave his office feeling very confident about my treatment plan or with the answers he gave. Any advice or suggestions would be great.",2019-11-07 03:27:46

After 3 months of having UC I finally managed to poop my pants!  Well maybe ""poop"" is a bit of a grandiose term for what happened, but more on that later.  I've been diagnosed with moderate UC, but from what I've been reading, I think I've been pretty lucky symptom-wise (no hospital, no missed work, I can still engage in sports).  I'd been feeling ok for the past few mornings of the day in question, and I hadn't woken up at night to hit the toilet (meaning ""the tank was full"").

Of course I did wake up feeling like I needed to go (usually my first session of the morning is just liquid), but for some reason, on this day it was very important for me to show my colon who was boss (me!).  As a symbolic gesture, instead of getting up and heading to the bathroom right away, I decided to go make my lemon water first.  After a couple of minutes of dealing with that, I felt the familiar rumble from down under.  I vividly remember thinking to myself at the time (and even saying to my colon), ""I hear you, but you know what, I'm still the boss"", and going about my kitchen related business.

I'm pretty sure that's when my colon gave me what ever its equivalent of the the middle finger is, and informed me that no, in fact I am not the boss.  At this point I started running (in retrospect, probably a mistake) to the bathroom and that's when it happened, the ""poop"" in the pants.  In reality there wasn't much, just a bit bloody liquid, but it was there.  The worst part was actually when I really opened up on my way down to the toilet (just a half second too soon), which made that beautiful white porcelain look a murder scene out of a slasher movie.

This was was about a week ago.  Since then, my colon and I have come to an uneasy detente,  some days it agrees that I'm the boss, and some days I let the colon take charge.  And so it goes...

I have made a couple of posts about being frustrated here, and hopefully this will be one of my last for a while. 

I was in the hospital on and off for 6 weeks a year ago (11/6 was my hospitalization anniversary). I eventually achieved remission with Remicade. At the end of May I started showing symptoms. I was diagnosed with C Diff in July--entirely my fault for letting it go on so long before being looked at--and finished antibiotics at the beginning of August. Had a colonoscopy at the end of September, still inflamed toward the end of my rectum. They said to give it some time for healing, and I had a Prometheus panel done at the 6 week mark from my most recent infusion to see my Remicade levels. Went back to the doctor after being incredibly miserable and missing a few days of work, and we decided I would abandon Remicade and start Stelara. I had also developed some extremely painful skin tags around my rectum, for which they gave me some Lidocaine to help until things get under control. Great, I had a plan and was thrilled to be moving on with a light at the end of the tunnel. They ordered some blood tests to just keep tabs on how I was doing and started me on 40mg of pred, tapering 10 each week, so a really short course. The last question my husband had for them was if this could possibly still be the C Diff, and they said it probably wasn't, but that they could run another test to make sure. 

I just got a call from the doctor that the C Diff test came back positive again. We are canceling the Stelara infusion and re-making my appointment for next Wednesday to get Remicade. They are running a plethora of tests on the stool sample I turned in yesterday and may be calling back later today for me to provide another based on their findings. The doctor wants to do a fecal transplant to help with the C Diff, he is confident that it will cure it. Has anyone had fecal transplants for C Diff and how did it go? Did your C Diff come back after? From doing some light reading on it, it seems like it is a wildly successful procedure. 

I am so emotionally and physically exhausted from all the back and forth. My poor, amazing boss and my team that I direct have been so flexible and understanding. My husband has put up with me sitting in the bathtub crying from the pain of the tags.  I am going on a cruise on December 7th and all I want is to be healthy by then so that I can enjoy some time with my family who I very rarely get to see.

I know that people with very adverse reactions tend to over-report so I’m wondering in people’s here experience, how common are these side effects really?

My question is, if this is the flare up, then why have I been bleeding without pain for the past god knows how long? 

Is there always just some bleeding? 
I was in somewhat of a remission before this flare, feeling great. Best shape of my life. Then the stress happened and bam, I’m weak and miserable and pitiful.

All the while the world is on fire around me and those that have perfect health whine bitch and moan about their lot . Thankless people get thankless results . I am grateful . The darkness just weighs heavy on a brother . But light comes through at the darkest moments . Or so it goes .

I’m writing this to you . I’m sorry you have this . Thing . This wicked evil that no one else can see and calibrate to show you a little more empathy . Gentleness . Humanity . You have something inside of you that is not glamorous or noble . It’s evil . It’s wicked . It’s dis.ease . It’s not fair . But your Soul knows what’s up . There’s a reason for the pain and one day you and I and everyone in between will understand what that reason is for .

I posted a few weeks ago about my possible UC symptoms and if I could have it if ct was normal. Turns out after my Er visit the GI I got referred to was quick on scheduling a colonoscopy yesterday where he confirmed it was ulcerative proctitis, with moderate inflammation. He gave me some pills he said were called 5-asa and he said I would have a follow up booked soon.


I was still kind of drugged upon waking so I didn't get to ask a lot of questions, plus he had to run off for the next scope. So now I'm left wondering what you guys kinda eat during a flare since I'm still in mine for now, and what this kinda means for me going forward. Is it like guaranteed to get worse down the line or does it sometimes only stay at the proctitis stage? What else should I look out for, besides stopping my advil use which I have as of the 1st.

I don't know where to start or what the point of this post will be, but im just feeling really down about my UC more often recently.

Im 23M, 125LB-ish 5'10"" (underweight), recent college graduate looking to start career, working part time in retail in the meantime to pay for rent/food/bills. 

I was diagnosed October 2018 with mild UC. Since then ive tried Lialda, generic mesalamine, delzicol, prednisone tapering, as well as some biologics like Humira [adalimumab] (built up antibodies after 3mo) and Entyvio (vedolizaumanababa whatever] which I started in September, finished my introductory doses, and am waiting back on tests to see blood levels of the drug and level of inflammation from stool sample. 

Ive tried different diet plans... no meat, liquids only, no caffeine, rice+chicken... Pretty much all the most recommended stuff ive tried but never see any results that make me want to stick with that diet. I always pass around 10 liquid/fluffy stools a day

Besides being on the higher dose of prednisone, I've never ever felt good in over a year besides maybe 2 or 4 days I felt pretty good, which must be random.

I always see these posts of people finding remission on their first treatment, or being in remission for 12+ years and then having a flare up for only 1 month, or whatever other stories i see.

Having these symptoms for what must be going on 18 months soon is honestly the most draining thing I've had to deal with, and there isn't anything to look forward to. Am I still on a flare? Do I just have lingering symptoms from damaged bowels? I honestly have no clue what my body is doing or why any medication / diet change isn't helping, and I'm convinced my doctors have no clue either. Every visit they just want to try the next thing and the next thing with standard doses. I got a fast metabolism, maybe I need more frequent doses? 

I just want a normal healthy bathroom trip frequency again because I can't live my life with these symptoms any more. The lifestyle change and uncertainty of it all has been overbearing and it doesn't seem like there is an end in sight.",2019-11-16 08:00:48

I hope I don't get a lot of hate from people for this, but I have seen a few posts these past couple of weeks where people think supplements will cure their UC. If that was the case, it would've already been cured by now. From a lot of trial and error I have learned the hard way that the people who have ""cured"" or ""healed"" themselves are outliers.

You should totally add supplements and try diets if they help you, but don't call quits on your meds. Every time we flare up our chances of colon cancer goes up.

When I was 17 I went to the doctor to ask for help with my acne, it wasn't crazy bad but being a teenager etc I wanted rid of it. He prescribed me a course of  antibiotics. Within the week of taking them I started to have bouts of diarrhoea, loads of what I can describe as red water. Up until that point in my life I never had problems with my bowel. I stopped taking the tabs thinking maybe they were the source but wasn't sure. Then I took them again and low and behold same issue again. So obviously I stopped taking them completely. Then sometime later I can't remember exactly when I started to have intermittent issues, cramps etc and more diarrhoea. Then I went to the specialist and it was confirmed after a colonoscopy that I had UC/Chrohns. I told the specialist at the hospital that this issue started with the antibiotics, he dismissed me like I was a dumb idiot. Anyway fast forward to this year after 12 months of a bad flare and I doing alot of research on this. It turns out many other people developed UC after a course of antibiotics. It would seem that the antibiotics kill all good as well as bad bacteria in the gut, then if you are unlucky only the bad comes back and hey presto. So after realising this and watching some YouTube videos I decided to take pro biotic drinks and tablets, also have prebiotics and eat more fermented food. This has helped considerably, as earlier this year I could not leave the house, now I have very few problems with diarrhoea. I still have it and yes I do have som problems still but if you have never done this then try it, I take 1 probiotic tab a day and 1 pro biotic drink a sometimes with a banana as a pre biotic. This has helped me leaps and bounds, also I found drinking kefir helped alot too but I don't like the taste. Hope this helps somebody. I generally eat bread and eggs everyday, but I must say that I only eat lunch and dinner or breakfast and lunch, I try and not overload my gut, I try and eat in a 6 hour window and fast for 18 hours during the week and at the weekends I relax this.",2019-11-18 10:53:12

I’ve technically been flaring since last October on and off. It’s been really bad starting this august and i’ve changed medicines, dosage, started suppositories,  and finally thought I had gotten it under control last month. But starting last week, it’s back and this is in the midst of college app season and a bunch of tests at school. It has been extremely hard juggling everything together.

So today I had (quite literally) a shitty morning. but I also had 2 tests, so I sucked it up and went to my first period to take the first test. After I finished, I really couldn’t stay at school. So I went to the nurse and came home. I skipped my second test which was the last period of the day but I emailed my teacher and he knows about my UC, so he was completely understanding. 

But, after school got out, I get a call from one of my friends who told me that during lunch one of our other friends started talking about me and how I had ditched the test and then proceeded to say that I was probably going to “be sick” again tmrw to skip another test. Her tone made it seem like this was a regular thing for me even though it is one of the only times that I have skipped a test...

Idk why it made me so mad that she insinuated that I was using UC as an excuse to ditch tests. It is so frustrating that people don’t understand that although UC is an invisible illness, we are still in pain even if people aren’t able to see any physical changes. With people my age also thinking GI stuff is taboo it also makes it hard to articulate wtf i’m going through when I talk about how I’m sick.

I was diagnosed mild ulcerative proctitis in August 2019 and have always had mild symptoms (3 BM per day, some mucus, occasionally blood, bloating, mild cramping) ... After my diagnosis I started Mesalamine supporsitories and have luckily had near disappearance of these mild symptoms for 3 weeks. Then, this past week, I have been having 3 looser (but not completely loose) BMs, some bloating and cramping but no blood or mucus. My doctor has (in the past) called this “nearly clinical remission” ... so I’m not sure if I should just expect these symptoms to be a part of the natural course or if they are a clear worsening that warrants reaching out to my doctor.

Quick background I'm 2 months into my first ever flare up. Spent the first month with rectal pain and bloody stool before getting a colonoscopy. Officially diagnosed with proctitis, likely due to UC. I've now been on mesalamine for a month, spent a week on Uceris, now over a week of 50mg pregnazone with a nightly enema on top. Sticking to the recommended diet of course. I'm supposed to start tapering off the pregnazone now, but my symptoms have not improved at all. The only change is I went from bloody stool to just blood.

How long should I wait until I start getting worried/should I ask to stay on the pregnazone longer? Also my blood tests came back completely negative for markers, would it be worth trying to get on antibiotics instead of steroids in case my symptoms are actually caused by an infection not UC? Or could this risk making things worse for me?",2019-11-19 16:19:11

Now yesterday the inflammation had already started to reduce a bit (after like 3 days of treatment so that's bloody good), today it's returned but I also have a rotten cold which may be to do with it. However although my stools are nice 3-4s on the stool chart, they are extremely frequent. I often have to go twice in quick succession, and this happening twice a day. And it's not because of the tenesmus that's been happening in flareups - they're proper, full size (honestly even larger than normal) stools that are coming out each time.

So I just wanted to talk about ""friends"" for a moment. Since being diagnosed two girls I (F) would call my dearest and closest friends have become quite the opposite. My best friend since we were pre-teens (im in my 30s now) was completely unsupportive of my diagnosis. She told me I didnt handle it properly and made my diagnosis all about how I had hurt her feelings. It ended up that we have completely cut contact and totally removed ourselves from each others lives. This was a devestating blow to me right after diagnosis, but I have moved on from it as best I can.

More recently another so called friend had started developing tummy troubles too. This has now escalated. In the beginning I was supportive, of course, but lately it has become impossible. She has had a colonoscopy that came back clear but still insists she could have UC because it was too painful for her to have her whole colon examined. Anyeay every symptom I have she has worse. Everything I had to deal with she is dealing with worse. If I say I'm visiting the bathroom 5 times daily shes going 7. If I confess I didnt make it to the toilet she didn't make it multiple times. Now if she asks how I am now she gets the same response. 'I'm fine', because I literally cannot cope anymore with her turning the most upsetting thing in my life right now into a pissing contest about who has it worse. I'm seeing this girl out drinking till 3am in the morning and eating food I wouldn't dream of going near due to how it affects me (Indian for example), whilst I have barely left the house for weeks except to see my specialist. I just find it so upsetting, why is she doing this? I dont understand. Does she want UC? She can gladly have mine. I live overseas and when I visit her I never see any evidence of these awful symptoms except being very mellow dramatic in the mornings. Maybe I am wrong and she is terribly poorly and it manifests differently for her. Maybe I am the one being a shitty friend. I don't think thats the case but I guess it could be. 

Anyway sorry for the wall of text I just wanted to share with people. Hear you opinions and thought and your stories about friends who let you down horribly or pulled out all the stops and came through for you when you needed them most.

Some gross details ahead, just so you're warned.

My story started last year. I noticed the smell of my BMs had changed for the worse, and shortly after that I noticed other changes too: I had urgency, increased frequency, stools were loose, there was A LOT of mucus, and some blood. My GP initially attributed this to the diclofenac another doctor have given me for a bad wisdom tooth infection (at least those fuckers are gone now). He also figured I was backed up quite a bit and that could cause me these issues.

He gave me omeprazole and something else, don't quite remember what, and told me to try and wait it out.

Meanwhile my symptoms continues and got worse. I was often passing nothing but gas,  water/mucus and blood. It was messing with my life something fierce and I couldn't stand it anymore. I wasn't in a lot of pain, it was more tenderness than pain. I should also note I wasn't exceeding 5-6 toilet visits a day.

Eventually my GP agreed to send me for a colonoscopy. Great, finally some answers. Only when I called, they told me the soonest I could come in was a month later. Of course I agreed.

During the wait however, my symptoms slowly started to go away. I had already stopped taking the omeprazole and the other thing and wasn't on any other meds. Didn't change anything about my diet. It went away on its own over time. I think the whole ordeal lasted about 2-3 months.

So colonoscopy day arrives and man, the prep had to be one of the most unpleasant experiences in my life so far. The procedure happens and the result is... NOTHING. Nothing pointing to IBD of any sort, just some red spots in my sigmoid. Everything else looked normal. Great. No answers, but at least its over.

Fast forward to September of this year. Same smell comes back, same symptoms. I see my GP again, he goes with severe constipation yet again. He prescribed me a stool softener. It definitely helped in some regard, but it didn't fix my issue at it's core.

I decided to wait it out again, but we're nearing December and it hasn't gone away. The mucus has lessened quite a bit, but the blood has increased. I'm also feeling a bit more pain than before - though could be gas pains as the pain tends to go away. I average about 3-5 toilet visits a day now. Not so much an issue with diarrhea, if anything I feel backed up again.

So my question is, if this was UC, would it not have shown during the colonoscopy? Is it possible they completely missed it?

I will probably call the enterologist who did the c-scopy last year and ask for a consultation, but I'd like to be armed with as much info as possible this time.

Sorry for the long post, thank you if you took the time to read this.",2019-11-23 09:07:34

I had been doing fine for almost a year now. I have pancolitis (diagnosed in April 2016), and have been dealing with high risk hyperplastic polyps on the right side. I've had 2 colonoscopies in the last 3 years, with a third in 3 weeks. I have had points where I was having accidents and couldn't go far from my house.

As far as medications, I had been on Apriso, and then switched to Sulfasalazine because of money. Did the Imuran and didn't do well. Had a bad reaction to it. Did budesonide several times, which sucked and just puffed me up. My new doctor put me on vitamins, because apparently I should have been on them with Sulfasalazine. For whatever reason, it triggered a flare... I've been vomiting and more frequent trips to the loo. At least my doctor will be happy... she thought I was in a flare when I saw her. Blood tests showed high inflammation and high WBC.

In this time, I moved from college back to near my hometown, and now to several states away. I got a new job, kind of stressful, but I had been handling it well. 

Only 3 weeks to see if I have actual tumors. And to measure the scarring. And just be more depressed than I already am. I'm on wellbutrin to try and manage it. I know others have it way worse, and I try to remind myself, but this illness sucks and it sucks the life out of me. My family is starting to learn more about it, especially my mom who came to my last colonoscopy and about passed out when the doctor came in to talk through it. They are nice to me about it now. I really just wanted to rant, because most people don't get it.",2019-11-23 07:46:15

I am a 22 y/old f diagnosed since February 2019 with ulcerative proctitis.

After a trip to the ER and exhausting all types of different enemas, suppositories, lialda, and steroids I have made the choice to begin remicade. I am very nervous. I avoided this for as long as possible because I'm scared and it's still hard to wrap my mind around my illness and the fact that its serious enough to warrant such a treatment. 

I have no idea what to expect or what it's like to be on biologics. But I am going to give it a shot!! 

I'm in grad school and coming back from a week off and a trip to the ER I talked to all my professors to catch up on my assignments and one of them after listening to me explain my situation told me ""that I cant use my illness as a crutch or an excuse to do what I want"" and that I told her I was doing the best that I can and she blatantly looked my in the eye and told me ""no you're not"". She has a reputation for being an unnecessary bitch so it is what it is. 

But I hope that biologics give me a shot at remission so I dont have to be vulnerable and try to explain my situation to people just so they can shit all over me and make it out that a trip to the ER and a week off was a vacation rather than a miserable experience. 

If anyone has any advice or stories about their journey to biologics I would love to hear it!!!",2019-11-24 19:58:11

My flare ups were very mild at first but got worse, and have gotten more regular.

I get flare ups 3 or 4 times a year and they last several weeks to months each time. Basically a substantial amount of my life. I know that my symptoms are really mild compared to what a lot of people suffer - I get constipation, cramps, pain on the toilet and a LOT of blood, and what I like to call ""emergency poos"", but it's only 3-6 times a day. The problem is it has never shown up in blood tests, and my only post-diagnosis sigmoidoscopy was during remission and found almost nothing. So every time I go to the GP about a flare they look at the test results and tell me everything looks fine, as if that makes it okay! 

The gastro nurse put me onto prednisolone last year, which actually worked, and I had to fight the GP who wanted to take it off repeat prescription when my sigmoidoscopy showed no flare. I feel like I'm going crazy, I have these horrible symptoms most of the time and all the medical professionals look at me like I'm making it up because my bloodwork is clean.

After 10 years in remission I flared up about a year ago and have been fighting ever since. Go figure this happened right when I got a new job and had a number of other life issues going on. Since then I've had two colonscopies and have been on a variety of medications. My diagnosis is Ulcerative Proctitis , about the first 15cm into the colon past the rectum.

&#x200B;

1. Sulfasalizne
2. Mesalamine tablets
3. Mesalamine suppositories
4. Mesalamine rectal suspension.
5. For the last two months I've been on 40 mg of Prednisone per day.

Despite all this I have had constent Tenesmus to the point where I don't want to go anywhere and it's interfering with my health, my job, my life in general. Accidents happen constantly and adding on the Prednisone has made me bloated, fatter and I feel like even the tenesmus is not affected , possibly worse. Bleeding has been down since starting the steroids.

The Dr plans on having me go on Entyvio soon, once everything clears through my insurance. Any other suggestions on how to combat Tenesmus and go about living my life? I've heard suggestions of taking tumeric and ginger, but so far no luck.

4. If you're using pot, what strain are you using and how much?  How did you zero in on the type of pot that worked for you?
5. If you're using a CBD product, how much are you using and what brand?  How did you come to the brand that worked for you?
6. Can you give a comparison of before starting this treatment and how you're doing now?  How long did it take to get to your current state?

I know everyone is different, some experimentation is needed to tweak things to the individual, etc., but I was just looking for some general guidelines and experiences, especially from those of you who are working with medical professionals and mixing this with conventional medications.

I’m not technically anemic as my hemoglobin is normal (and was even normal while I was flaring), but my doctor checked my iron levels right before my third infusion and they were a bit low. I started taking oral iron supplements about a month ago and they seemed to be working well; the symptoms were pretty much gone, until last week after my infusion when they all came back even worse. I got my hemoglobin checked again this week and it’s still normal. I know that non-anemic iron deficiency can still cause symptoms I’m just surprised they’re this bad.

I’ve never heard anyone else mention this, and I did find a study online about Remicade-induced functional iron deficiency but it was pretty small and the mechanism wasn’t very well-explained.

I've never been this miserable. Post diagnosis, I thought my life was over. I was scared and angry and I felt alone. I felt so alone. People around me kept telling me it's nothing. People have no concept of this disease.

I knew I had to change. I went into monk mode. My body needed me and I decided to take quick action.

I went from a couch potato to walk 15kms everyday in a month. I was lucky enough to get a job in this economy. My friend signed me up with a psychologist and I have been having sessions with him since.

I was a miserable couch potato eating junk and sleeping at unhealthy hours (5-6 am).

The disease has taken a lot from me. The sheer joy of eating. The woman I loved. My Mental peace but it made me realise who I am and what matters the most.

Screw this disease, screw it.


Each one of us are in this together and we will get through it together. 

You guys have been a great support all this while. You were there to listen to my musings, my anxiety ridden silly questions and what not.

Back in 2015-2016 right before I was diagnosed, I'd seen my doctor at the time about the issues before being referred to a GI. I mentioned I had trouble with binge eating since I'd ignore eating all day from discomfort, then go to town later on, rinse repeat. He laughed and said ""we'll talk about your weight another time,"" (at the time I had gained maybe 10-20 lbs. Kinda made me feel invalidated at the time so I ignored the issue.

I thought I would ask here in hopes that other people have experienced the same thing and that I can get some reassurance or answers.

Last month on the 20th I had a routine colonoscopy, but the doctor took a lot of biopsies, a total of 12 spread out over the entire colon (as I have pancolitis now). I am guessing that they have results from these biopsies as they have arranged an over-the-phone appointment due to coronavirus scheduled for the 20th of August.

Basically, I was told the usual, to expect blood in the stool for maybe the first few days after the colonoscopy, you know the drill. But here's the thing, I didn't pass a bowel movement until late at night on the 27th! 7 whole days. It was obviously a huge amount of faeces, so much so it filled the bowl and the toilet almost flooded the bathroom when I flushed. But the strange thing was that it was like diarrhoea, when I was expecting it to be really hard and constipated. I passed the remainder of what must have been left in my colon from the night before on the morning of the 28th.

Here's the scary thing. That was the last time I took a bowel movement. It's the 4th of August. I'm at 7 days again, but the day is coming to an end and I've still not passed a movement. My stomach is bloated and I just do not have any appetite. If I try to force myself to eat my body tells me to stop, like it knows there is no room. I tried to eat an apple and I was gagging and nearly regurgitated it back up even though I wanted to eat it.

Again, I've got time to discuss this with the doctor in a few weeks time but I just wanted to know your guys opinions.",2020-08-05 00:16:20

(pardon any bad spelling, still coming off anesthesia and laughing gas-)

I have severe pancolitis, and I’m 14 which makes it a bit harder to treat me. Last time I had a colonoscopy, I was hospitalized for a week and a half afterward. It sucked, and I was on a bunch of IV steroids because they could only get through the sigmoid colon due to the heavy inflammation.

Flash to today, I wake up from anesthesia to my doctor. After about 5 minutes, my mom comes in and explains that I can go home and that the pictures showed only some mild inflammation with a couple patches of bloody, inflamed colon. 

The doctor also said that I would be starting Remicade because when he looked at it, he said it would really help me, and probably put me into remission. I haven’t been in full remission for the entire time I’ve been diagnosed (~2 years almost 3 at this point) so this is a big deal!

I’m almost crying at this point, I’m just so happy my first year of high school won’t be ruined by this disease! I thought I’d share it with y’all because I always see everyone’s happy remission stories, and I’m just so ecstatic to have my own!!",2020-08-04 22:21:10

I also have a feeling like I have to go to the bathroom, but it’s never diarrhea, I just have to go right then. This tends to happen when I’m out in public at the worst possible times. 

I try to breathe through it but have resorted to an awful habit of pinching myself really hard on the thigh to distract my brain from thinking about possibly getting sick somewhere. This happened today in my vets office while I was bringing my dog in for a checkup. I was so embarrassed and these random “attacks” I call them are so bad and intense that people have no idea what is happening to you. I had not yet eaten today when this happened. 

My GI dr suspects it could be a gallbladder issue as I have some stones, and I don’t disagree, but I also get random feelings of extreme nausea and sometimes rapid heartbeat along with it a lot, and before I had gallstones. Unfortunately with the healthcare system sucking big time in the US, I am unable to get “affordable” insurance until November. So I can’t get any additional scans, colonoscopies, or a new medication until later this year. 

I feel so alone and feel afraid to leave the house and that I might have to run off and get sick somewhere and everyone worries and feels helpless if they witness it. Does anyone else have this happen to them? Have you found any solutions? Sometimes they’re so bad I have to take a Zofran like today. Any advice or words of encouragement would be so appreciated. I hope we all are able to find remission one day. This is awful.

Edit: I have had many people and doctors suggest it is anxiety. I tend to think of myself as a very calm person who works well under pressure and I rarely stress much. This feels so systemic and specific that I know it’s not an anxiety attack but could see why people resort to that answer.",2020-08-04 16:32:37

\- They only sent me an info pack regarding the procedure towards the end of yesterday. It says you shouldn't take any iron tablets a week before the procedure, but obviously I had no idea about this and so I have taken them at least a couple times. Anyone know if this could be an issue and why?

\- I read the info pack earlier today, as the person I spoke to at the hospital told me I'd only receive the info pack the day before, so I assumed I didn't need to read it when I got it last night. This info pack however says I'm only allowed to eat certain foods from two days before! I'm now feeling very concerned as I have eaten some things that I shouldn't have according to this (across two meals). Could this be a big issue?

\- Did you experience any discomfort/pain during the procedure?

\- How did the sedative make you feel both during the procedure and after? (I'm in the UK where they don't put us fully to sleep). How cognizant were you of what was happening? Could you fully understand and take in the results of the procedure? I'm very worried about the results (concerned about IBD but even moreso about possible cancer) and the prospect of receiving bad news whilst not even fully mentally present is very scary to me

\- Did you feel rough for a while after the procedure? For how long? Any advice on taking care of yourself after?

Otherwise, other effects I have noticed is increased gas/ bloating (and sensations of a totally empty stomach?). And more mucus-y stools and light colored stools as well.

The doctor has prescribed Lialda but I haven't picked it up yet (my UC is pretty mild, and it doesn't feel that urgent to start medicating). Also, Lialda is apparently no good for while I breastfeed, so not sure about starting a medication to have to get off in 4 months. 

I'm also curious to know how UC might change after I have the baby. It's common for pregnancy to come with digestion issues... But with a diagnosis of UC, I suppose it's not going to go away, right?",2020-08-07 22:06:09

However, now that I’m out of the hospital and taking 60mg pred once a day, I’m noticing this pattern: 

7 AM: Wake up. Lots of bright liquid blood when I go to the bathroom like I was holding it all night. 

7:30 AM: Take 60mg pred. Eat.

11 AM: Go to bathroom, no blood. Eat.

2 PM: Go to bathroom, no blood. 

4: Go to bathroom, no blood. 

6: Go to bathroom, a small bit of blood on stool that is less formed. 

8: Go to bathroom, a bit more blood on stool. 

11PM: Go to bathroom, more blood on stool and in bowl. 

(some time overnight): again more blood in bowl. 

To me this seems like a clear pattern: the further from my last pred dose, the more blood. But the doctor in the hospital said that it doesn’t matter what time you take it and staggered doses won’t help.

I got diagnosed last October, ended up running the gauntlet of medication but nothing was working. Tired a plethora of different natural routes. Had a massive flare in March that almost sent me to the er and knocked me to bed rest for a few weeks. 

I finally was put on prednisone and xeljanz. They made me feel better than I have in years. Went about my life happy and on my way to remission till two weeks ago. I started noticing my symptoms coming back. No bloating of pain or loose bms. Just blood and mucus. Still I was only going once a day. It's only happened twice so far once a week it seems.
I changed my diet cut out pretty much every except bland foods. But today some of the urgency came back. 

I was like oh well you know I'm supposed to be taking two of these 10 mg xeljanz a day according to the manufacturer. And my doctor told the pharmacy that I go to that is my dose. But always told me to just do one a day. Which I haven't heard of. Usually people do the 5 twice a day or 10 twice a day. I my doctor just said one. I even triple checked and yep only one 10mg a day. 

So today I was like well maybe that's why my symptoms are coming back. So I asked hey can we bump my pills up to two a day. Nope, got shot down. Instead I get a doctor's appointment and possibly back on steroids and possibly another colonoscopy. Sorry for the long post, I'm just super frustrated I don't know what I'm supposed to do to keep flare ups down. Not a great way to kick off my weekend.

TL;DR was put on xeljanz after nothing was touching my mild colitis. Was doing great till about two weeks ago. Asked doctor why I don't just take the recommended dose of xeljanz. Got shot dow now have a doctor's appointment, talks about another colonoscopy and steroids again fm.",2020-08-07 17:35:31

Il post my questions here with Hopes some of you can help me with answers.. 

..will my constant pain be gone? When I'm healed obviously..

What happens if its crohns disease and I have no meds left? 

I have a lot of stomach issues like gastritis but doc said it doesnt look like crohns, will the gastritis go away if the UC is gone??

Do I still have to take meds after I have surgery?

Do I need to eat more to hold my natural weight?

Will I have more freedom with my diet?

What is the outlook of life after the surgery? Like is there anything I cant do with a bag?

Is the surgery itself really dangerous?

Will I still feel exhausted all the time?

Does a seatbelt affect your bag while driving?

Will I be able to do intense physical work or exercise?

Do you have to keep getting surgery for the actual stoma or does one surgery do the trick? Like do u have to move the stoma around as iv heard of tissue dying..

That's all the questions I can think of now.. I'm just more scared of it being crohns than anything.. I'm only 27 so my doc wants me to be 100% sure this is the route I want to take..like as far as I'm concerned it's more inevitable if anything.. would you do it or would you have tried to keep your colon for as long as you could?",2020-08-07 17:27:30

To clarify I've not been diagnosed with UC (or Chrohn's) but my GP suspected I have it based on stool sample results.

The doctors told me that all parts of the colon look normal and that there was no inflammation present, and that they've taken a few biopsies to check if there's anything not showing up. They said nothing looked worrying at all. This is confusing to me as 6 weeks ago my GP told me that my calprotectin levels were 'incredibly high' (didn't specify a number) and my faecal occult blood test was positive. I'm also still having symptoms such as left-side abdominal pain, some blood & mucus in stool, bloating, and some diarrhea.

(If it's relevant - all bloodwork was normal inc. autoimmune markers. This confuses me a little as I heard IBD was thought to be autoimmune, but GP told me it wouldn't show up as such in bloodwork. Anyone know if this is accurate?)

My question is - is it possible that this could be UC, that for some reason the inflammation is low right now (despite the symptoms?), but that the biopsies will be able to show that UC is present?

I ended up trying Miralax and Milk of Magnesia to no avail. Boy was I uncomfortable. I even wrote a post a couple days ago on this subreddit asking about laxatives.

Around this time I was getting progressively weaker, losing my appetite and thirst more and more, and feeling increasing  abdominal pain and associated nausea. There was even one awesome time when I was ejecting a Miralax moment from my posterior, and the cramping nausea made me projectile vomit. I have never felt so sick in my life!

My poor GF convinces me to go the ER. CT Scan indicates lots of inflammation and what I think the doctor said was ""thickened intestines."" I stay the night and they hydrate me on an IV, and in the morning one of the doctors tell me that I tested positive for C Diff. Basically, my colitis and this gross bacterial infection threw a party and rudely invited me.

I'm going on my third night at the hospital now and they are keeping me hydrated, giving me powerful antibiotics for the C DIff, and started me on steroids today for my flare-up (all I was taking before was Apriso).

My pain is definitely less now and there is little to no bloody mucus in my stool, which is something I have been dealing with for months. Today I was finally able to put down two out of three of my liquid-only meals, and I even chowed-down on a couple graham crackers. Heck, I'm even using the computer right now!

What I've realized is that I need to be more honest with myself about how I'm feeling. 2-3 days before I was feeling awful and crying on the toilet, I still wasn't feeling that good and there were noticeable changes in my energy level, appetite, and bowel movements. I should have sought treatment then and saved myself a lot of stress and pain. Also, in not being honest with myself, I was not honest with my GF, who I live with, who I love, and who patiently comes to my aide when I get sick.  When I downplay my symptoms when I'm not feeling well, it's confusing and stressful for her; she wants to help but I essentially cut her off from doing so. It's unfair to make my loved ones feel powerless that way.

Thanks for letting me vent a little!

Been doing the pred taper, then back up to higher doses for the past 10 months. 

Gave remicade a try for 7-8 months with no lasting results. Now on Xeljanz, I had quick improvements from the first week, but now in the 4th im struggling. Each of these biologics were in conjunction with 4.2g lialda and whatever dose of prednisone i happened to be on at that time. 

I’ve also had 2 bouts of C. diff and being tested for it again now as they hope it’s that instead of the symptoms of the disease.

6121,Time to have surgery? Get a second opinion.,reddytowers,7,i67ig9,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/i67ig9/time_to_have_surgery_get_a_second_opinion/,17,"Hi, first time poster. I don’t really have anyone to talk about this with. No one that really understands or appreciates what true heath feels like. I think we often suffer and celebrate in silence. So I’m happy to share it with you all, my fellow UCers.

If your doctor is pushing you towards surgery remember you can, and should,  get a second opinion. I was first diagnosed in my early 20s. I’m 40 now. Around 6 or 7 years ago, my doctor at the time told me that we had exhausted all our options and that he was referring me to a surgeon to start the ball rolling. I was terrified and in disbelief. I stopped going to him and went without treatment for maybe a year or so and living in a constant flare. Losing weight. Even had a weird infection on my face at one point.

I was making excuses to hide my condition from my coworkers living in a hell of anxiety. Around this time I had a son. I began to worrying about the risk of developing cancer from leaving my condition untreated. So, I finally sought out another doctor I found online. She was at the forefront of research and she was near me so I figured it could’ve hurt to see if she was taking new patients.

She agreed to see me, put me on steroids to help in the short term and gave me a scope. She told me she was gonna get me well. “We’re gonna get you well”, she said. I was doubtful, but hopefully. After a high dosage regiment of masalamine (Yes, Mesalamine) I was feeling better again. We later reduced it to a maintenance dosage. Luckily I’m not sensitive to it. Where the other doctor had failed after going as far as to prescribe risky biologics with no success, this new doctor had brought me back from the brink with a comparably low risk treatment.

Up to now I feel great. I’m not on any medication and haven’t been for almost 3 years. My digestive system is not the same as it was. I hear more gurgling in there than I think is normal with a little more gas than I think non-UC people have. But I have no urgency, no blood, no mucous. I have to be careful with overly spicy foods because although my colon is healthy, I don’t think it’s as strong as one that hasn’t gone through UC, so it takes longer to recover. And when I look at my 5 year old’s fully formed stools I’m admittedly jealous 😅. But, I’m doing better than I could’ve hoped to be 7 years ago.

So I urge you, before taking that final step, make sure you get a second opinion. It could change everything.",2020-08-08 23:46:48

I was an active kid, played every sport, but one day she decided that I was doing drugs.. and that my brother was molesting me. None of which was true. Fast forward to around when I turned 16, maybe slightly before, I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis due to high stress of everything my mom put me through, which I wont go into detail.

At first, I was going to the bathroom like every hour. I quit my job at a bakery because I just couldn't keep running to the bathroom. After that, I just never wanted to leave the house. No medications worked except steroids and obviously steroids are the worst kind of drug to be on. When I turned 18, I moved out because I got a nice paying job in the tech industry that let me work from home. But also, I didn't realize I had to get health insurance on my own at 18 and back then, health insurance was hard to get if you had a pre-existing condition, they wanted me to pay close to $800/month and I just couldn't. So basically, I spent my years of 18 years old to just about 28 living in fear of going out into the public. I, like many people who don't go out, got into gaming to take my mind off things.

When I turned 28, or close to that age, Obama had issued the affordable healthcare act and that was the first time I could actually afford health insurance (I was hired as a contractor) that wasn't the same payment as rent. I met a girl online, and I wanted to get healthy to maybe move forward with my life. I went to the doctors, got back on steroids to ""get it under control"" which, it did.. I just couldn't stay on it. Tried every drug again, started a biological, Remicade. I had high hopes for it, but wasn't getting anywhere. After the 3rd dose, I decided to go on a diet (Specific Carbohydrate Diet - SCD) which helped me tremendously. I was able to buy a car, and this was all within maybe a month of the diet. I felt great.

Me and the girl I met decided she would fly to my city and stay with me for 2 weeks. I think that was the first time I took loperamide at slightly higher doses, and I'm talking like maybe 10mg total. Because I had to drive to the airport and I wasn't completely confident about controlling my bowels yet. I didn't use the bathroom for nearly 5 days, mostly also because my colon was starting to heal. But during that 5 days, I ate off my diet. I was eating normal every day food, and that caught up with me.

So from there, I knew I had to stay on the diet to live a normal life. Which I did for a few months, and eventually she decided to move in with me and thats when things changed. It was hard for me to diet and miss out on eating out at restaurants and such. So I turned back to Loperamide.

I was feeling good, eating regular foods, and taking loperamide daily. after a month I realized I had to up my dose for it to work properly, ok no big deal, Sams club sells this stuff for $4 for 400 pills! I was only taking like.. 8 pills maybe? But I started to increase it almost weekly, within 3 years I was at my highest ever, my tolerance was way up.. 50 pills 3x within 30 minutes of each other, so 300mg. I never got high off of it, because I did a reverse tapering and honestly had no idea what I was doing.

I was about to move back to her city after her mom got cancer, and she wanted to be close to family. She moved first while I finished out the apartment lease which had 3 more months on it. Within a week she wanted to break up. I had already cancelled my lease, took time off from my job to make the move.. I was in disbelief. Whatever, as many break ups go, I wanted to get in shape and eat healthy. So I went back on my SCD diet. Within 2 weeks my bowels were slowing down and I started feeling normal instead of diarrhea, it was kind of normal. Then one day I over did it with eating nuts while watching a movie with a friend at the theaters.

The next day, I couldn't use the bathroom. By mid day, it hurt, a lot. Apparently eating tons of fiber, while also on lots of loperamide while also possibly having a slight inflamed colon lead to a blockage. It hurt so bad that I asked my mom to take me to the ER. At that point, that was my first day missing a dose in nearly 3 fucking years.. Also, back then, loperamide addiction wasn't a thing. I remember googling loperamide before increasing the dosage and it kept mentioning how it was a really safe drug because it never crosses the blood brain barrier.. I felt as if it was a safe drug.

I had to stay over night and it was THE WORST night of my life. I was in the ER so I had monitors on me and an IV going and my withdrawal symptoms started to hit. I couldn't sleep. I had restless leg, I was having crazy dreams while trying to sleep and only sleeping for 30 minutes at a time. This continued for another night and I had no idea what was causing it. I had no idea I was in a withdrawal, I figured my colon issue was really fucking with me. I was going stir crazy not being able to sleep in the hospital, I'm pretty sure the doctors kept giving me benadryl to sleep, which looking at information today seems to have made my restless leg a lot worse.

I couldn't stay another night at the hospital. Depression set in. time was going by so slowly, I BEGGED the doctor to let me go home and he didn't recommend it but I needed it. I signed some papers that said I was going against doctors orders and went home.

The fresh air felt great. It was July, nice and sunny.. finally, I'm going home! I was really weak. My mom spent the night at my place. The sleeping was still horrible there, and I'm pretty sure I made it worse by taking tylenol pm to try and sleep. I didn't care. I dealt with it, fuck that hospital. I had my cats with me, I may have had cold sweats and restless leg but I was going to get through this.

I looked at my boxes of loperamide, and I said fuck that stupid shit, it caused all of this by messing my colon up! I vowed to not use that shit again. After a few days I was able to use the restroom. I was HAPPY to have diarrhea back.. I started my SCD diet, eventually things got better, and I was on a controlled anti-diarrhea medication, lomotil, that, looking back on I'm not sure if it even gave me any relief since I started taking it during my detox period and was still having to poop a million times a day.

I think maybe after 1 week I felt normal again, energy wise, sleeping.. maybe 2 weeks for like actual good sleep. That was with a sudden stop of 300mg of fucking loperamide..

Anyway, after a few months, I was good. I was healthy gut wise, I wasn't taking anything. I decided to take a year and work on myself before looking for another relationship. I stayed on my diet, I worked out, I was in the best shape of my life.

June 2018 I was getting noticed by girls. It felt nice. I was 35 and made dating profiles on all the apps, I had women of all ages talking to me. July 1st I went on my first date and I broke my diet. I wrote it off and said I'll just stay on my diet at home, which I did and honestly that date food never affected me, but mentally, it gave me confidence to eat outside of my diet once in a while.

A month later, and I ate pizza, and the next day I had to go hiking for a date and I was worried I wouldn't be able to control my bowels in the mountains! I took loperamide at a slightly higher than normal dose and hey, it worked!

That was the start of my second decline. I used loperamide again. That was also around when the FDA was cutting back hard on suppliers. I couldn't get it from Sams anymore. Ended up getting the 96 pill bottles from Target. I was on it daily again, I figured I would just ween off of it before I started eating healthy again so as to not fuck my colon up.

2 months later I met the perfect woman. I proposed within 3 months of dating. It was January 1st 2019 and we found out she was pregnant and I couldn't have been happier. 6 days later we were in the ER for her pain as she had an ectopic pregnancy. They had to remove her right tube. We originally planned to get married after the baby was here, but decided to move it up to May 2019 and consult doctors about IVF after that because the ER doctor told us the right tube looked damage and not capable of working correctly.

Wedding was set for mid May, around May 1st I told myself I would cut off the loperamide (I was at 15 pills 3 times I think? So 90mg) and maybe double my lomotil dosage for a couple days (I still took the lomotil daily, 2 pills 3 times, never upped that). Well, after skipping it successfully for a day, the next day I felt I was coming down with something. Actually, I think I literally was sick and also withdrawing from loperamide, because my wife's mom came to stay and she was sick. So anyway, I was running a fever and my bowels were messed up. I blamed my MIL for getting me sick, I was in bed.. I took my loperamide and suddenly I felt the chills ease up. So then it hit me, the FDA was getting rid of the drug because of people using it to get high and killing themselves, this must be withdrawal. So I told myself I needed to take it to get through the wedding. I also got back on steroids, while following my SCD diet, I felt really good by the wedding date and honestly the steroids let me enjoy my honeymoon at the beach.

I didn't stop. I kept taking it, kept eating junk, I mean, sugar and carbs in itself are an addiction. I kept increasing the dosage, I found large quantities online still. By end of 2019, my wife and I got lucky and our first try of IVF worked, she was pregnant, we were happy. The pregnancy took, had no issues, due date was set for August 25th 2020.

I decided I was going to taper off, do my diet and get healthy for my family. It was my new years resolution. For a few weeks, I did. I was taking 35 pills 3 times a day. I was coming down, eating right and for reasons I can't remember I stopped. I decided I wasn't going to increase my dosage. I would stay at what i taper to, 28x3. I'm sure social eating made me break my diet and go back, or the addiction to sugar in general.

Nobody is making loperamide in large quantities anymore, I realized this last month when I emailed the ebay seller who was price gouging it if he was about to run out of stock, he said yeah he was waiting for more but it was out of production for now.

Realizing I have to get off it immediately, and get through whatever withdrawals before the baby is here, I decided to do a steep taper schedule. I was at 32x3 and decided I would cut back daily for 2 weeks to get off of it 2 pills per dose (6 pills total) per day.

Today I'm writing that I'm loperamide free for 5 days after tapering 6 pills a day and dealing with my idiotic choices, restless leg, mind and heart racing, loperamide is a SERIOUS drug, I've read NOT to take antihistamines as it makes restleg worse, and so far it's helped not taking it.

I'm typing all of this because it feels good to admit my mistakes and if it helps one person to avoid abusing loperamide, great. I used the drug to live a normal life in the way it was technically meant to be used for, it feels good to not be dependent on any kind of drug. If I ever use it now, it will be once in a while, at a low dose.

Currently I've been on SCD (specific carbohydrate diet) for nearly 4 weeks and already I'm starting to heal and just some lomotil lets me leave the house. Every week it will get better for me, I know SCD works, and I took every miracle drug/supplement in the book to try to get into remission. Remicade did nothing, steroids actually gave me temporary diabetes because my doctor forgot to put me on a taper schedule, so you can't stay on that too long. If you've never tried SCD, give it a real shot, like, a month. Your body needs to heal, if you try it for a couple of days and go back to eating shit, then you didn't give a chance. I don't even mess around with their weird starting diet and homemade yogurt crap, just follow the illegal/legal list, if after a month you notice nothing different, then you gave it a shot to live a normal life. Trust me, diets are hard, it's easier for people to keep eating trash food and hope meds work, but a diet has no side effects. I understand it wont work for everyone, but it's worked for a lot of people who give it a real shot.

My baby is due in 10 days, and I'm proud I've made sacrifices to keep myself healthy for my family (and save money, loperamide isn't cheap anymore.) I've had Ulcerative Colitis for 21 years (16 - 37) I've known SCD helps me since I was 28 and I still broke it, diets are hard, it's easy for anyone to come in here and flame me for promoting it or how dare I say I know their bodies better. I don't, but give yourself a chance at a normal life, if meds aren't working for you, just please try a diet change, even if it isn't SCD, just avoid carbs/sugars/prcoessed foods. You can still eat fruit, surprisingly, at the start I usually ate bananas with almond butter.

That's my story, I know this disease sucks, if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask.

**TL;DR:** I've had UC since age of 16, I went without health insurance and doctors for 10 years and became a hermit, obama gave me a lifeline with the heatlhcare act, I abused loperamide, twice, got off it with withdrawals, twice, living a normal life with SCD at the age of 37",2020-08-08 19:22:51

I'm not doing it because I like the taste of meat and don't care about animals, I'm doing it because I'm trying not to kill myself longterm. The virtue signaling that meat is causing my symptoms pisses me off to no end, and the fact people will argue with me on how ""research shows"" vegetarian/vegan make symptoms less and is more healthy just gets to me because they are always so focused on 1-2 studies without ever knowing that UC diets are extremely individual from person to person. Morally speaking, I don't like the meat industry either, but I don't have the privilege of eating vegetarian or vegan without shitting blood and going to the emergency room I can't afford. I don't have the financial privilege of buying the free range grass fed organic meats that supports your moral code. Do what works for you, just don't tell me what is best for me when you have little grasp of how much veggies can wreck the fuck out of me. It's not just diarrhea, it's anemia, fatigue, pain, bleeding and just a daily discomfort in life that people never seem to grasp. When you can't eat wheat, potato, rice, beans, legumes, corn, onions, broccoli, seedy berries, nuts and basically everything but small amounts of leafy green veggies or mushrooms, how the hell do you expect veganism to work for me?

Is moving to 6/4 week interval sustainable for the long term? It seems like symptoms are being masked at this point and remission is not being induced. Should i be considering a change?

Finally got my date for a total colectomy 🤗 . I had a colonoscopy on Wednesday which showed my ulcerative colitis has spread to the whole colon and it’s extremely damaged according to my doctor. 
I was diagnosed with mild proctitis in 2018 so it’s a bit of shock that it spread and got so bad over the two years but with no medications working and now I’m steroid resistant I’ve no choice but to have it removed . 
I’m really excited as living like this is hell . I can’t wait to eat again and go out without worrying or being in pain . I keep counting down the day’s everyday and just praying they go by quickly 🤞
They are planning on doing laparoscopic surgery but my surgeon did say if my colon wall was too thin I might need open surgery . 
I’m going to university at the end of September (or when ever they open due to COVID) will I be healed enough by then ? I’m hoping the first couple weeks are online to give me more time to heal .

In the past 9 years my lifestyle has gone through extreme changes, from being NEET, to seasonal work, to full time work.

I used to think that my flareups were mostly seasonal as I noticed them in winter more often and with longer duration than summer, when I was working seasonally.

After finding full time year round employment I had a really good handle on the disease to the point where I went from 2016-2020 without really needing any medication, even with far fewer dietary restrictions than most UC people I know. If I had any problems during that time they only lasted a couple days to a week tops and did not impact my productivity, mood, or wellness aside from a few more bathroom trips than normal

Then around March of this year (after a few weeks of work from home) I had a fairly bad flareup that lasted a few weeks, then when going through the process moving out of an apartment and into a house I seemed to go into remission, but the past few weeks since late July I have had a flareup again which left me lethargic (although the past few days I have been feeling a lot better but still passing painful nonsolid stool with occasional blood).

So I have a new consideration: Could leading a less active lifestyle, being cooped up in home with a toilet nearby, and no real psychological ""need"" to ""keep it in"" be factors in flareups? Or is this just a nine year long series of coincidences? Could it be a chicken/egg situation where having a flareup will cause me to be less active and want to go out less, but it seems weird that the common factors in my flareups seem to be ""you're at home for the vast majority of your time""",2020-08-14 19:46:26

My insurance won’t approve entyvio unless I’ve failed Remicade. So it’s either Remicade or Imuran.

To be honest, Imuran seems more scarier as I have a weak stomach and I’m prone to nausea. I’ve been scaring myself reading posts about how the side effects can be.

A few days earlier I realized I have a big problem regarding my mental health and have to take action. It’s probably a depression, but there’s no diagnosis yet. 

I expected there’s an inflammation going on (at least a smaller one). When my doc called I realized all those (smaller, but still annoying) symptoms have another cause: My mental health plus my nutrition which got worse because there’s no energy to take care of it properly.

So not just my mind is a mess, my bowel gets manipulated by it as well and this makes my situation even worse.... 

Last week I was not able to work and tried to make a plan with some actions to improve my situation step by step:
- find a therapist (with some luck I found one already)
- talk with people about it (I talked with my parents and some friends about)
- find a motivating way to workout (I bought Ring Fit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch and I loved it. So far I’ve been doing workouts everyday)
- take more care about nutrition (is in progress, but need to be improved more)
- have fun / meet people (also in progress, is already better than before)
- sleep longer (that’s a tough one...)
- appreciate the current status of your UC, because it can change overnight again (I’ll do my best)

It’s a long way to go, but my bowel was less active the last three days and I feel better. The next days, weeks and months will be a roller coaster with some setbacks but I hope that there will be also some more positive days like the last few ones in between.

I had a colonoscopy on Aug 7th, and was diagnosed with UC. This was not really a surprise to me, as my mother also has it. For context, my mother was diagnosed in 2008 at age 51. I am 36, female. My doctor put me on Pentasa (1g 4x/day) after my colonoscopy, so I have now been on that for approximately one week. At my follow-up appointment today she asked me if I would prefer to try azathioprine or just immediately start a biologic. My mom was able to go to my appointment with me (a blessing, since I had a horrible migraine at the time), and was asking a lot of questions because she was initially prescribed Asacol, then after maxing the dose of that, she added azathioprine, then after several more flares, was eventually put on Remicade, nearly 5 years after her initial diagnosis. She also did months and months of prednisone at various times during those 5 years. My doctor said steroids are a last result, and that you should treat UC aggressively to get into and stay in remission, rather than spending potentially years of having flares. 

I feel like when I read about what meds people are taking for their UC, noone says they started a biologic immediately and a lot of people resist needing them. And I see a lot of stories of being on steroids. Is my doctor's advice unusual? Normal? While I don't relish the idea of my current flare continuing, doesn't it seem strange to not wait to give the Pentasa time to work?

Are all biologics similar? Just sort of a some work better for different people kind of situation, or are there some that are considered better? She mentioned starting with Remicade since it has helped my mom, it might also work well for me.

I have UC for almost 5 years. After my first flare that ended up with my diagnose of UC, I was like semptom free for 3 years. I was lucky to get into remission by just using oral mesalazine tablets. Than beginning from June 2019, my flares started to become common than before. From the beginning of May 2020, I have been on a mild-flare up. After more than 3 months, still I am not in a full remission. My previous flares was way more severe than this one but they ended up within 3 weeks all the time. Although this one is mild, my symtoms become chronic. I have used oral mesalazine tablet for the first 2 months like before but it didnt workout. Then add ""Asacol enema"" then ""boom"", most of my symtoms were gone. However if I dont use enema form of mesalazine even for 1 day, my symtoms slowly return. So I think the tablet form of mesalazine currently not working for me. I have been using Salofalk for 5 years now, it was great for all those years until now. I want to ask, I have a chance to change my mesalazine tablets with ""Asacol 800mg"". Since Asacol enema is perfect rightnow, does it make a real difference to pass into Asacol tablet rather than Salofalk? Do you guys have noticed a difference between brands of mesalazine products?",2020-08-19 22:31:16

Thought I would share it.

An enzyme that usually stops bacterial growth in the large intestine stimulates inflammation in some people, resulting in ulcerative colitis—a chronic digestive disease that affects more than 750,000 Americans, according to scientists at Rutgers University-Newark.

In a new study published in Immunity, lead author Nan Gao, Associate Professor of Cell Biology in the Department of Biological Sciences, School of Arts and Sciences-Newark, reports that in people with ulcerative colitis, the gut enzyme lysozyme which normally functions to restrain bacterial growth, instead stimulates inflammation.

This results in the formation of ulcers and sores in the large intestine and rectum, hallmarks of the inflammatory bowel disease. Detecting these cells in the inner lining of the colon and rectum is a standard diagnostic feature of chronic intestinal inflammation.

""This study demonstrated the existence of a delicate balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in our intestines,"" said Gao, who conducted it with postdoctoral researcher Richard Yu and doctoral student Iyshwarya Balasubramanian. ""Insights about how to gain such beneficial immune balance may be useful for future intervention of inflammatory bowel disease.""

In biochemical and genetic mouse laboratory studies, Gao and his team focused on Paneth cells, the main producers of lysozyme, which are typically found in the small intestine and rarely observed in the large intestine or healthy colon. In cases of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which affects 1.6 million people in the US, Paneth cells are often seen in the colon and rectum.

""The frequent appearance of Paneth cells in the inflamed tissues of patients colons is highly unusual and poorly understood,"" Gao said.

In the Rutgers-Newark study, scientists discovered that lysozyme secreted by Paneth cells located in colon results in suppressing the growth of certain bacterial species and results in an imbalance in the gut microbiome which leads to intestinal inflammation.

In healthy individuals that have normal production of gut lysozyme, these bacteria flourish enabling an individual immune response that prevents colitis.

""This delicate balance is achieved and maintained by a constant interaction between our body and the commensal microorganisms that play a significant role in digestion, metabolism, and the immune system,"" Gao said.""",2020-08-19 13:00:13

My doctors gave me great info on my medications, for now I’m being slowly weaned off the steroids that helped me relieve the inflammation, and I’m on Mesalamine enemas and pills. But for my diet I feel like I barely got any info after I asked. I was told that because I’m in a flare I need to avoid high-residue foods then when I’m better I can slowly add in foods to see how they affect me. This seems pretty straightforward and I can name a few high residue foods that are obvious but I’m having trouble finding a guide or list online that I wanna trust. I know it’s impossible to have an entirely complete list because of how much food is out in the world but if anyone has a resource that they trust for this and are willing to send me it would be greatly appreciated. This might sound lazy to some people and that’s fine but I just don’t know who to trust and also I feel very weak and tired from what I just went through so a little help getting started would be great so I can start getting food in me. Thanks!
Also, I’m pretty upset right now over this diagnosis. I know people can have this condition and still live full lives but it’s still scary. I’m only 22 and I take good care of myself, eat healthy, basically don’t drink and completely don’t smoke, workout every day but still I got sick. And I already have another chronic illness to deal with since I have hypothyroidism caused by empty sella syndrome since birth. So now I have two chronic illnesses to deal with for life so it’s pretty upsetting.

I know there's no one safe diet for UC and food affect people differently, but thanks to my living with other people and my picky eating habits I feel so lost.

I have done gluten free and low FODMAP in the past. I did okay on gluten free but saw no ill effects when I re-introduced regular bread, so i eat that quite a bit. Low FODMAPS were hard to stick to but to this day I still avoid some foods on the list, namely things like honey (never liked it) and a decent amount of fruits.

I'm wary of keto because I watched my mom try it and she seemed miserable on it, plus I know I couldn't deal with those restrictions long term. Also, can't really do nuts or many fruits.

I have actually been trying intermittent fasting and had flares start around the same time period I was starting them so I wonder if its related...

I know apples set me off, if I have too many raw carrots I get mushy stools (that's what I get for trying to snack healthy at work, go figure). I try to avoid most fruits, pretty much the only ones I eat are bananas and blueberries. I might have one blackberry or raspberry on occasion. I love tomatoes and eat them almost every day except when flaring because I've been warned they can be too acidic. 

Fast food does not set me off and I like to have McD's cheeseburgers when flaring because I seem to digest them easily. And i do love cheese in general maybe too much.

Right now I'm living with my mom and brother, and it gets annoying because my mom cooks a lot and her food tends to be very good. I will make my own food if I feel I can't eat what she's made.

Meds wise I'm on entyvio but seem to need shorter intervals because I feel like I'm about to flare again. I fee like food is something I need to figure out, but its hard because it seems like food affects me one day and not the next.

6326,Just came back from a 5 day hospital stay following an elimination diet and fall from veganism. Feeling unbelievably better so want to give some thoughts.,Shoemethemonkey,11,iepb6j,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/iepb6j/just_came_back_from_a_5_day_hospital_stay/,4,"Hello there,

You may remember me as the guy who was starting an elimination diet then later partially gave up on veganism in efforts to control my flare up. Last friday I was admitted to the hospital by my gf who called my work and essentially forced me to go. It was 100% necessary. 

Before my thoughts on the elimination diet and veganism, I want to quickly let you know the results of the hospital stay. I was not planning on a 5 day stay, but after going to emergency and having my blood tested, I was found to be very anaemic, with essentially no iron in my bloodstream. This was later determined to be because I was bleeding when I crapped for 3-4 months straight. I was admitted right away and told to sign a blood transfusion consent form in case my condition worsened. Over the next 5 days, I was given IV iron supplements and IV prednisone. I also had a colonoscopy which required large amounts of laxative as well as a clear liquid diet for a couple days; not fun coupled with the prednisone hunger. Im still awaiting biopsy results, though I am clearly inflammed and have pan ulcerative colitis as per my cscope. When I left, I was feeling much better, and am on yet another course of prednisone along with vitamins D and calcium and an iron supplement until my next hospital visit in a couple weeks. I also had the chance to speak to a nutritionist before I left, who recommended a low residual diet until my symptoms were better managed.

I had tried the elimination diet prior to my stay, though this had not really gotten me the results that I was looking for. My flare up continued to get much much worse in the mean time. I now believe this was because I was trying an elimination diet while trying to maintain my veganism. When you eat vegan, almost all foods that you are eating are complex carbs, high in fibre. As I recently learned from my hospital visit, these are things to avoid while you are going through a flare up. My elimination diet started with tempeh, leafy greens, tofu, and soy milk. All of these except for tofu were likely exacerbating my symptoms, so I never stopped having blood in my stool. 

2 or 3 weeks ago, I was feeling so lethargic and in pain, I just wanted a burger and did not care. After 8 months of solid veganism, it was amazing to eat a burger again. My stomach handled it very well, and I later felt much better than I had in a long time. After this, I decided to start eating some red meat again and this temporarily alleviated my symptoms. I was even feeling bold enough to try a beer a couple days later, though I did regret that.  I think this was because of the iron content in the red meat, coupled with the lack of fibre in the meat. Anyways, it wasn't enough and I wound up going to the hospital anyways.

Anyways, I have been out for 4 days. I am eating meat, cheese, and greek yogurt again as these are low residual foods I can tolerate. I feel amazing; I got out and ate almost until my stomach hurt. I had one of the biggest, solidest poops I have had in 4 months. I even went to the gym again for the first time in like 6 months, though, man, I have lost some strength (and about 20lbs) since my last visit. Prednisone is truly a magic medicine, though obviously the plan is to stop after 2 months, and follow up with even some biologics; not sure what the plan is yet, but we are working on it.

ANYWAYS **TL;DR:** 

 \- Go to the hospital if you have blood in your stool. Full stop. Trying to treat the issue yourself might seem convenient, but a doctor will know better.  
 \- Low-residual diet will do wonders during a flare up. Essentially means low in fibre, though do some research if curious.",2020-08-22 21:59:25

So over the summer I’ve done research and joined social media groups on IBD and UC. However, reading all the stories of other fellow IBD goers, I never read a story where they were put on Tacro/prograf as a treatment for UC. The way my GI explained the reasoning for putting me on Tacro is that he wants it to be a stand in for my stelara to work as i just had my first infusion last week. From researching and asking questions about Tacro it seems like a solid option in treatment even if its meant for organ donation rejections. I guess my bigger question is, is my GI thinking out of the box too much or is being prescribed Tacro for UC flares actually more common than i think?",2020-08-22 08:34:34

It is much appreciated!

I was diagnosed with UC in July 2017, I lost 30 lbs at the time in less than a month (150 to 120), severe bleeding, nausea the works etc. I was admitted into ER and a scope was done where I was diagnosed with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The GI that performed the scope prescribed me Mezavant which did absolutely nothing. At the urge of my general physician, I went back into the ER a week later and was given a proper GI who put me on prednisone and salofalk enemas. This worked and saved my life. After the prednisone taper I was in remission just on mezavant for about a month and a half (Sept-Nov 2017). 

In November 2017 around midterm season (I'm a college student) I flared again. My GI was out of town on holiday and this pretty much infuriated me to no end, I was prescribed cortisone enemas which did nothing for me either. It was very hard to get in touch with the clinic and I was debating switching GI's at the time. He eventually prescribed me prednisone again, which worked really well again. I had to defer my final exams as it had been a month of flaring at this point, but I was just glad to be feeling healthy again. He put me on imuran at this time as well.

After this, he decided it was time to try the big guns (Remicade) I had big hopes for it but unfortunately I failed it really quickly and developed antibodies. In March 2018 I tested positive for C.Diff, how I got it I will never know. I was put on a course of antibiotics that worked and I eventually tested negative for C.Diff but I was still flaring afterwards. I went in to see my doc in April 2018 and he was so shocked at how much weight I lost in the month or two that I saw him he immediately put me on 60mg of Prednisone (the highest I've ever been on) and switched me to another biologic in Entyvio. He set me up with a surgeon just to get to know him and to see what the process would entail. Luckily I didn't need to meet him again as I entered a long period of remission after this. I was on Mezavant (4x a day), imuran, and salofalk suppositories. My doctor also upped my entyvio dosage to every 4 weeks instead of 8 or 6. 

After this I entered the longest remission I've had since being diagnosed, I was taken off the suppositories in January 2019 and mezavant was reduced to 2x a day. I was essentially in remission from August 2018 till August 2019. That's when I experienced symptoms of abdominal pain, urgency, diarrhea and so on. I was put on 40mg pred taper and was sent on my way. I was fine for a few months, and I flared up again in December 2019/January 2020. I was put on 40mg of prednisone...again...and was again sent on my way. 

I was somewhat okay with where I was until recently, in June 2020 I tested positive for C.Diff again. And it really rocked me. I had a ear infection in March that I was put on antibiotics for which I'm now assuming is the culprit, but that's besides the point. I lost a bunch of weight rapidly, I was put on prednisone initially because I was thought to be flaring but I in fact had c. diff. so the prednisone could have made me feel worse as it is a immunosuppressant.

My doctor switched me from Entyvio to Stelara as I developed antibodies to the Entyvio. I had my loading dose of Stelara in late June and honestly it made no difference at all. I was really ill until I was put on vancomycin to fight the c.diff and I felt pretty good after the course of antibiotics were done. I was out hiking again, living life normally and great. My doc again recommended me to see a surgeon as a consultation, and I went and asked about the c.diff as that's been my main problem this summer. He said that surgery would essentially cure the c.diff. I also asked him about my case in general, and he said that it's a matter of when, not if I'll need my colon removed. This statement has stayed with me.

As soon as I tapered down to 5mg of Prednisone I flared again. Like really badly. In one week I went from solid stools once a day to blood, mucous, waking up at night and going 10-15 times a day. It always amazes me how rapidly a flare can progress.

I was sent in for a sigmoidoscopy and my doc determined there was severe inflammation and I was put back on a 40 mg taper of pred. Now I have never been on prednisone this long, and this is one of the first times I can feel it's side effects fully. The joint weakness, tiredness, insomnia, depression etc. have really hit me this time. I'm at my wits end and am scared to leave the house. My doctor has recommended I up my dosage of Stelara to every 4 weeks, and I am skeptical of putting another powerful drug very often into my body when it's not even a cure. 

Also, guess what? I have c.diff again, a recurring case. Now I just want to get surgery to remove my colon and be done with this disease. The vancomycin has helped me feel better, and honestly at this point it's just a mental thing. I want my colon gone, I hate it so much. It is completely unpredictable, and mentally this disease has put me through the ringer. C. Diff has obviously been a big culprit, but I have been experiencing symptoms on and off even during ""remission"". 

I talked to my doctor about surgery this week, and he said if I decided to follow through with it he would support me 100%. He said that if I had had this disease 5 years ago, I would have surgery by now. And he also said that my disease was worse than his average patient, which really surprised me given the horror stories I read on reddit and the internet.

I have been watching videos on stoma's, what it's like to live without a colon and although I'm feeling better now (I go 6 times a day with watery stool instead of 10-15) I am nowhere NEAR my definition of remission. And my patience is running very, very thin with this disease. I'm honestly just waiting for it to get worse again so I can go ahead and get my colon removed without any feeling of guilt. 

I know I might sound crazy, but I feel that I am emotionally and mentally ready to have my colon removed. I am on 30mg of prednisone right now, but what happens if I taper down and I flare again? Should I just wait and see if the vancomycin works for good this time? I know some people wait until the very last second to get surgery, or want nothing to do with it. I am the complete opposite. I want to be proactive and get rid of it so that I can maybe have some semblance of ""control"" over my life going into 2021. With how this pandemic is affecting everyone I also see this as an opportunity to maybe heal from surgery while everyone else is staying home and there isn't much pressure to leave the house anyways.

This was more of a rant than anything, so thank you for reading this far. I just don't know anyone in real life I can turn to other than my doc and surgeon, who have both essentially said it's up to me at this point. I am on track to be on Stelara every 4 weeks which scares the hell out of me considering it's a relatively new drug, and 4 weeks is very often. I've been on prednisone for a long time at this point too. I just want my life back. Basically it comes down to this: I am scared I will regret having surgery while there's still a ""chance"" to save my colon. But mentally I know that I can deal with having a stoma, and it won't bother me as much as it does for other people. But realistically, how long can I stay in remission without being on steroids again? A year, 5 years best case? Stelara is my last hope at this point.

I'm just lost right now, sorry for rambling. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.",2020-08-23 04:35:44

First time posting here and I just needed some advice. 

I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy booked for Wednesday and I'm terrified. I experienced sexual assault as a child whilst in a partially awake state and I'm scared this experience is going to bring back these feelings. My care team is aware and I've been told I can bring my friend in to the waiting and recovery area, but I'm still super nervous.

Any tips or advice?",2020-08-24 21:25:37
6363,Looking for advice/stories in the middle of a horrible flare up,Obvious_Claim_6879,7,ifupjq,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ifupjq/looking_for_advicestories_in_the_middle_of_a/,10,"Hello all! Thanks for taking the time to read this, I am just wondering if there is anyone in my shoes and asking for advice from those that have gone through these nasty flare ups. I have been flaring up severely since the end of May and have had 0 relief despite my best efforts. I have been going to the bathroom between 15 to 25 times a day with severe pain and nausea.. For the last month or so, I have had severe vomiting and not eating.. this is odd because I have never had upper GI symptoms with my UC in any other flare up.. but now, I am throwing up daily even if I had not eaten in 6 plus hours.. I had just got done failing Entyvio after only a week after the initial May infusion and have started the process of changing medicines(I have done and failed Remicade before this medication).First the doctor put me on 40 mg of prednisone declining at 10mg a week, which did nothing (literally no side effects or benefits), so they redid the prednisone at 50mg for 5 weeks, which again was fruitless. Next they changed the entyvio from every 8 weeks to every 6 weeks, this quicker entyvio shot was not helpful at all. Now they are finally changing the Entyvio to a newer UC medication called Xeljanz which is in the insurance approval process.  They found a c diff antigen last week(negative for c diff but positive for the antigen)and put me on Vancomycin which again so far has made no change..and I am finally getting in for a colonoscopy and endoscopy early next week.. in the mean time, I am suffering greatly and haven't even been able to work in 2 months. My hemoglobin is dropping by about 2 points with each blood test (now it is around 8) and I have been becoming increasingly miserable and weak. I have had long remissions (5 years and 2 and a half years are the two longest remissions)in the past but have also had long flare ups(2nd longest was 6 months, longest was 18 months but mild for half of it). This flare up has been severe for the longest ever, I have never been this bad and stayed this bad for this long. I went to ER once during this flare up and am becoming increasingly likely to have to go again. My doctor was fairly unhelpful in the beginning and took a lot of time to take action, they thought I would be fine doing a conservative treatment strategy. This was a big part of my problems.. I did drastic diet changes for 3 weeks so far where I cut out all sugar drinks and fast food and only had cooked food and soups that is considered easy on UC (This did nothing so far and I am suffering exactly the same as a month ago). My question is, has anyone had these issues and is there any advice you have that finally snapped you out of flaring up? I am strongly considering surgery as this is really becoming frustrating. Anyone is encouraged to share their story if they have any experience or advice for someone suffering with a stubborn flare up that will not give any relief. Is there any antinflammatory supplements that helped you? Major diet changes? Or medication? Thanks for reading!",2020-08-24 20:28:21
6364,Anyone else smoking for UC management?,veqtor,12,ifubse,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ifubse/anyone_else_smoking_for_uc_management/,21,"My first flare came 9m after quitting smoking when I was 27, then a year went by trying every medication, nothing worked, if things didn't get better I would probably have a surgery.
As a last resort, I wanted to try nicotine patches, didn't work, so I tried smoking 3 cigarettes a day. After one week I was feeling much better.
Note though is that I had switched to a UC friendly diet at this point. After a month I was completely symptom free.
Still, smoking isn't good for you. I recently switched to IQOS, I was afraid it wouldn't contain whatever it is in smoke that makes UC go away for some of us, but it seems to be working, but only done it for 2 months. Could very well come back in 7 months.
I'll report back in a year when I know.
I can eat basically anything I want, with some exceptions, I need to be careful about bell peppers and spicy foods, those can get my stomach a bit inflamed. I think it's partially because I'm smoking way less than a regular smoker, just enough to manage my UC.
I wish researchers would pay attention to us, I know there are more of us, because somewhere in cigarette smoke, lies a substance, that holds a possibly great medication for UC... But I guess anti-tobacco sentiment makes it taboo, to bad, because I don't want to smoke, that is why I quit in the first place. I just want whatever there is in tobacco smoke that seems to make my UC go away completely as an as-harmless-as-possible medication.",2020-08-24 20:09:27

I’ve been doing a bunch of trial and error of what’s safe and what fucks me up for two days. In doing so, I’ve come across some things that consistently make my digestive system feel soothed and calmed down:

1. Avocado. It’s great. It seems to tell my inflammation to calm the fuck down. At first, I had it in a PokeBowl mixed with other stuff like sauce so I didn’t think it was safe, but having it alone is a different story. Big fan. 
2. Celery juice. I actually noticed this when I drank it before being diagnosed. There’s a kind I get from Walmart or Target, I wish I remembered the brand name off hand, but I’d recognize it if I saw it - it’s in the produce section in a green bottle. It makes my stomach calm down every time. Brand does seem to matter - I tried a celery juice from Costco once (Kirkland?) and it didnt have the same effect. I’m sure it comes down to the ingredients. 
3. Turmeric powder. Also discovered before UC diagnosis. This is more for helping heartburn, but it seems to soothe everything. I take a few spoonfuls of raw turmeric powder and chase it down with gulps of water. I HATE the taste. Turmeric/curcumin in supplement/pill form doesn’t do anything for me. Has to be the powder. I’ve tried several brands of powder and they all have worked. 

Next, I wanna try a mix of cabbage juice and celery juice based on this study that seemed to reduce ulcer healing time from 42 days to 7 days. Study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1643665/

And maybe ginger. I’ve read good stuff about that too. I mean, I’m suffering to shit and I have nothing left to lose. I need to buy a press/blender/cheese cloth etc. 

SO, anyone else have any soothing foods to try? I am desperate for relief.",2020-08-24 18:56:47
6370,Black Licorice? Maybe.,PapaSteveRocks,3,ifr41z,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/ifr41z/black_licorice_maybe/,2,"Background: I’ve been on Xeljanz a year and a half with good, 80% results. Way less pain, no blood, no sick days from work. I’m quite happy after a few years on other meds. Still have urgency and loose stools, but those are manageable. Like I said, it’s an 80% life.

I stay away from trigger foods, which include nuts and chocolate. When I get a craving, Swedish Fish are my candy go-to. Recently, I grabbed legitimate black licorice as an alternative (not twizzlers). Eat a couple chunks, satisfy the craving for a sweet, continue on. 

During this time, I’m noticing less frequency, reduced urgency, and solid-ish stools for the last week plus.

It’s weird, no other changes to diet or routine. Maybe it’s the heat and humidity, maybe it’s some stress factor, but the time correlation with the black licorice snack is there. 

I’m NOT a doctor, I’m not even terribly enthusiastic about promoting something that might just be coincidence. If you’re in a real flare, please do not try this without a doctor conversation. This anecdotal effect is on a patient with minimal active symptoms. Me.

The question: Has anyone else ever noticed such an effect?

Edited: Please note that black licorice interacts with prednisone. Thanks to the commenter pointing that out. I have certainly had long periods on prednisone, that interaction is worth knowing.",2020-08-24 17:27:17

Lots of comments are about managing a flare at home even with like 20 bloody stools a day. 
Is it really possible? 
I mean, for me it was always when it gets to a certain point, like 5 bloody stools, lots of cramps, fake and night stools, I just have to go to hospital to manage it, because it gets worse and worse no matter what I do. Only prednisone can help me at that stage. I remember once when I had 20 bloody stools a day, I was so weak that I could only lay in bed and felt like dying. Also lost like 30 pounds in 10 days.

Since being an adult however I tried for years to get it “under control” and this is the first year it has been!

Last few months of 2019 I started to cut out meat, until I stopped eating it completely at the end of December last year. Since then I’ve had the bowls of a normal person IMO (I can only guess since I’ve only ever known going to the toilet loads!).

Now cutting out meat except the occasional white fish has had a crazy good change to my bowls. I go to the toilet like once a day now mostly in the evenings, I’ve had a few days where I haven’t gone for like 2 days in a row. Hate to be graphical but all my poos are actually hard now, I never had any blood but there’s never blood or mucus.

I can’t stress this enough from my own experience of someone who would go 10+ times a day and would often have accidents, cut down on your meat intake.

Just some backstory. I was diagnosed with UP (Ulceritive Proctitis) back in 2018 and have been on the Big Pharma trial train ever since. After Canasa stopped working for me, it was on to a Biologic. Finally something that works? Hopefully?

I start my first Biologic infusion on Friday \[dose 0 is what they call it\], but my biggest concern right now is the intense pain from my fissure. Or maybe fissures plural? The inflammation of my UP has caused this, as well as the strain from my lower GI swelling. Poops are excruciating as you can probably imagine. To deal with the pain, I'm applying Lidocaine cream twice daily and taking Epsom Salt baths at night. Also, afterwards I make sure to use an ice pack in the inflamed area. This has helped tremendously with the pain, but I'm still experiencing blood in my stool. Most likely from my fissure(s). 

Medication-wise, I'm currently on 40mg daily of Prednisone, but hope to taper off once I feel the Entyvio starts working. It's doing a great job keeping things at bay, and has cleared up all of my eczema. Now for questions for the community! Please help! lol! Is anyone in the same boat? My doctor recommends I go see a rectal surgeon to get rid of those god-awful spawns of Satan on my rear, but I'm afraid the surgery will cause more inflammation, etc. Asking for any advice. Should I wait until Entyvio kicks in and start seeing results? And how long does it take to recover from such a surgery? I'm afraid of more fissures creeping up even after such a surgery. Thank you all in advance.",2020-08-26 17:00:43

6405,Coming out of a moderate flare and need advice on how to 'not poop.',creepyforestguy,10,igx8yc,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/igx8yc/coming_out_of_a_moderate_flare_and_need_advice_on/,7,"Hey guys, in the past couple of months I slowly began to flare up again after perhaps five years of remission.

I stupidly ignored it, not wanting it to be UC and trying to pin the blame on other factors such as bad eating or gluten. Eventually, I had to admit it was a flare, and it got debilitating and exhausting a few days after accepting it. 

So two weeks ago, I found a great gastroenterologist in my new city and he scheduled a full oscopy from mouth to butt next month to see what's going on after so long. He also put me on oral Entocort (a steroid that only works on the colon) and Yaldigo (that's Asacol \[gastro-resistant, prolonged-release mesalazine\] for American friends). 

I have thankfully always reacted well to mesalazine that is released in the colon so I was hopeful about this combination and after two weeks, I am happy to report that my colon 'feels' less inflamed, I know you know what that means. I am also happy to say that the pre-poop cramps and pain of BM has subsided to almost-unnoticeable levels and my stools are no longer liquidy - they're firm and much more normal.

My question is though: how to stop going to the toilet so much? The problem is now, I am waking up in the morning and I have a lot of stool that needs to be pooped out. Today, for example, I have gone to the bathroom four times in the morning and had four 'regular' sized poops. I understand that my colon is still healing but how do you guys practise 'holding it in?' 

I'll go on a day trip this Friday and I'll need to be ready in the morning, I could just get up earlier and 'clear out' but it would be nice to not have to stop on the drive. 

I know it's a silly question and I should just be thankful that I'm seeing results but it's been so long since I was sick that I just appreciate anything from the community haha.

Finally after a month or two of IBD I was in remission (I know that that's a short time for some of you guys, I'm sorry).

Anyway, everything was fine. I would bleed a LITTLE like maybe a drop of blood worth (the color was much lighter, almost pink) every once and a while, but overall much better. I've been on Lialda for a few months. Today, however, I had a bowel movement and when I wiped, there was that same dark blood from before. Kinda freaked me out not gonna lie. It may have just been my body reacting to a bunch of grapeseed oil I've recently eaten,  but I guess I'll have to wait and see. Over the last week or two, my joints have been aching and I should have seen this coming tbh. 

Anyway, besides cleaning up my diet significantly,  what else is there to do to avoid another bad spell? Sit and pray? I hate having really bad health anxiety and this lol.

First the update from a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/icx0mm/another_colonoscopy_and_endoscopy_tomorrow/) : Results are relatively unchanged. Two years of 150mg of Azathioprine with occasional boosters of prednisone 10mg x3 daily for 2-4 weeks at a time and there is still some inflammation that appears to want to finally go into remission but apparently my colon has now become institutionalized and is terrified of life without the inflammation, which is the same result of the scope as last years, thus continuing the cycle of the roller coaster. i might eat around 3-4k calories a day everyday with minimal activity a gain 2-4 lbs a week and then lose it over and more a couple days later with no change in intake or activity. so hopefully when i see the b-hole doc in 9 days I'll be good to go for the biologics.

And now for the good stuff... the goddamn rant/vent/(insert any other fitting verb), so brace yourself, its igniting...well somewhat igniting (not as good as Leonidas' speech in 300 or William W's in Braveheart) but still...

You know what I really have missed over these last 3 years. MY GODDAMN SNACKS and my dignity. Pre-UC my go to for all the munching that I do (since I've never been a fan of big sit down for a long ass time meals) has been cashews, popcorn, slim jims, peanut butter w/ apples, sunflower seeds, beef jerky (Mingua Beef Jerky is the best goddamn jerky you will ever put in your mouth), chips with salsa, and Bold Flavored Chex Mix, watermelon, oranges, sodas, and finally grapes. but guess what i can safely have out of all those listed. the pb w/apple, the best goddamn jerky in the world, watermelon, and oranges. i can relatively safely binge on these minus the oranges (cant just sit down and eat 6 or 7 in one setting because the acidity is well...you know) , but everything else is a red fucking line. Either they have too much fiber, fat, or too prone to unsettling your shit and really fucking up your plans for the day. But do I let that stop me....for the most part yes. But every so often I get the taste for my forbiddens and end up regretting it later. Most recently I fell to the need of some cashews and slim jims. ""Dont do it...I know better...dont buy that shit rixxis, you fucking know what will happen"" is what I tell myself, but its been about 8 months and I think to myself ""my body is ready"" 

WRONG....real fucking wrong. I eat the 24oz of cashews and 10 of the single serving slim jims over the course of 2 days while pounding a 12 pack of Mtn. Dew Zero Sugar (better than regular Mtn. Dew, still debating on Code Red though). First day, stomach was a little pissed at what I had done, but no more than usual so I take some Levsin-SL every few hours and go about the rest of my day. Day 2...stupid ass rixxis looks at wife of rixxis and says ""want some Taco Tico, I want some Taco Tico"". Why the fuck did I want Taco Tico knowing wtf I had been doing is beyond my dumb ass, but this was not my thought at the time...it is now. I'm doing some work in our basement repairing the shitstorm the previous owner left with us trying to fucking hide it behind shit ass paneling walls by repairing some pretty large cracks in the mortar and then sealing it to waterproof the inside before I begin the work to seal and waterproof the outside. Suddenly, it hits me. My stomach is pissed, thus my colon is pissed because it knows wtf is next. I make my run upstairs to the seat I spend too much time in...(you know what the hell is going on here) and 30 minutes later I confidently make my way back downstairs to continue working. Then comes the gas, or what should have been gas (at this time I had completely forgot the carnal sin of eating the grease sticks of slim jims). Of course I dont realize my ignorance until about 90 minutes later when I finally hit my stopping point for the day and have a seat on my cushy microfiber chair to take a break before going to clean myself up as I was completely soaked with sweat. My chair is covered with a towel, I know I look like I just jumped in the pool fully clothed... After about 15 minutes my stomach says ""lets play a game..."" I get up to haul ass upstairs again and stopped suddenly... I look at the towel for some reason, yes it's wet, but that isn't what stops me. A familiar orange colored spot, I recognize this odd colored spot centered where my ass cheeks come together. GOD-FUCKING-DAMN IT!!! I run upstairs and before sitting I do a quick evaluation of my ass with some tp and of course its covered in greasy ass fat. [In case you don't know this side evil side of UC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatorrhea). This is not the first time I've dealt with this literal shit...oh no, I've had to leave work because of this, ruined some of my favorite shorts and scrubs because of this because this shit wont fucking come out no matter how much or hard you scrub desperately trying to save them. So now I have to choose between the indignity of wearing mampers or using some of the wifes supplies for the next few days to prevent throwing out more clothes, and debate what the hell i'm going to do about my cushy chair. Currently continuing to scrub the hell out of it because of course it bled through the towel and stained the seat. I miss the pre-UC times....I WANT MY GODDAMN SNACK FREEDOM BACK!!!!

I could pretty much eat everything and anything, but I generally ate well and folllwed what my dietition recommended. I would have sweets or junk food when I craved it, but didn't overindulge. Honestly, I was proud of this because food has always been my coping mechanism and learning how to eat mindfully was something I never really thought I could do. 

Fast forward...I've been in a flair now for almost 8 months and I'm really struggling with all the food restrictions I have. I'm gluten free, dairy free, low sugar, low fiber, and low fat. My dietition wants me to make 2 of my meals into smoothies until I heal a bit more. I put a lot of time and effort into meal planning and I generally love cooking and eating, but I don't really feel thay way anymore because I am so restricted. 

I'm feeling frustrated with this disease as a whole and the impact it's had on my life. I feel helpless at times and I find myself binge eating all the foods I know I can't have like chips, cookies, or anything with gluten. I know it's not helping, but I just keep sabotaging myself.

I recognize I am fortunate from reading some of the difficult journeys many of you have been on. Having said that, here is my story...

Diagnosed with UC four years ago. Doctor put me on mesalamine (long-term) and prednisone (to subdue the flare up). I have been symptom free and flare up free for four years on mesalamine. I am currently in the midst of a three-week flare up. Had a colonoscopy last week Friday. I am feeling better. Symptoms are improving, but not gone. My doctor wants to switch me to a biologic (Remicade). 

Here are my questions....

1. Have any of you NOT had to switch medication after each flare up? I would like to try prednisone (because it worked last time) and maybe up my dose of mesalamine (I’m not at the daily dosage limit) before I go to the next drug. 

2. My doctor says he doesn’t want to do a steroid because it weakens the immune system amidst COVID, but isn’t that a side effect of Remicade?

3. I am honestly scared of starting on a biologic “so soon” into my first flare up in four years. But, am I short-sighted that it is only a matter of time if the mesalamine is starting to “fail” me? Advice?

Today I’m a very confused individual. I was convinced a few weeks ago that my symptoms were coming back after being off prednisone for about a month and a half. Everything felt horrible and I couldn’t keep anything in. I waited it out and cut bread out of my diet. Started making more smoothies and ate less but better. I was thinking this would kind of relieve my symptoms. But today and yesterday I had poops that were regular again; I haven’t seen those since I was on pred! And nothing hurts either. So I’m wondering what’s going on. Has this happened to any of you? Does it sound like remission or am I just getting a good break before it starts to go down again? I’m so confused...
PS: I’ve also been going to acupuncture for my back pain. After my appointment is when symptoms started cleaning up, but I’m pretty convinced it’s a huge coincidence unless anyone else has had experience with acupuncture for UC :P",2020-08-28 22:41:24

I just feel so down at the moment wishing it would finally work so well to get me into remission. 8-10 shits per day (It's been worse but still a huge mental burden) changing between bloody water and something maybe considered semi-solid, not being able to fart normally without having to change underwear and thus sprinting to the nearest toilet like a maniac several times per dsy, the cramps, etc.

It feels like every new day is a new day filled with pain. I'm sick of it. It's always on my mind and it doesn't make life any fun.

He was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2016 and did lose the fight yesterday after fighting it besides acting. I’m a huge fan of the marvel movies and this news is so heartbreaking... I loved his role, his acting and even besides the camera he seemed to be such a great person!

But not just my fan heart is broken, also my biggest fear regarding my UC is back again: Colon cancer. There’s this increased risk as a UC patient. I learned how to live with my UC in the recent years  and as better I felt as less I thought about colon cancer. But after reading about his passing I’m lying in my bed crying and fearing cancer again...

My doctor just said a few a weeks ago everything is okay and I don’t need to worry about it, but yeah... Chadwicks death showed me again that everybody can get it and especially when there’s a higher risk. 

I needed to write this down. I’m not in a good mood right now and will try to do something with my family today. Hopefully I’ll get some distraction. 

RIP Chadwick Boseman!

I was having diarrhea up to four times a day for five weeks straight. It had a weird consistency, like it was sticky, stringy, and almost resembled sludge. It wouldn’t flush down the toilet easily. I’m not sure if that’s an indication of pus or mucous, but it was concerning. I was referred to a GI doctor, more blood samples were taken, as well as a few stool samples. Everything was normal besides the fact that there was a presence of white blood cells and inflammation found in my stool. I met with the GI, and he mainly suspects UC but my brother has Crohn’s so it could be either one. I’m scheduled for my first colonoscopy and endoscopy on the 8th.

On one hand I understand that you can find crazy anecdotal miracle cures and such, but I mainly use this reddit for advice, current information, and general guidance. I defended this sub by saying that my research here has helped me formulate a diet I believe helps me. She then told me food doesn't really make a difference with UC. Which to me is bizarre because I'm pretty certain I could induce a flare if I went crazy on dairy, nuts, and sugary shit. It's a weird feeling because I'm speaking to an expert on the disease I have and sometimes I'm like ""why do I know this and you don't?""...but then I think ""maybe I'm just telling myself a story that I want to believe?""

I guess I wish she was at least mildly curious about my diet and lifestyle instead of chalking up every single ounce of success to mesalamine. I don't know, does anyone else feel deflated after speaking to their doc?

The guideline (and the synopsis) is intended for physicians (and as such are written very technically) and provide the general consensus on treatment approaches and the our understanding of the disease. I'm also told that guidelines like these are really important for insurance companies determining what they will pay for and for who. I'm not sure if I would say it's worth a full read for everyone out there since it's so technical, but it could serve as a tool to discuss with your doctor and/or insurance companies to help make sure you're getting the best care. Especially if your care is being managed by a family doctor or even a GI doctor who doesn't focus/specialize in IBD. JAMA also put out an accompanying \~20 minute podcast with one of the authors. It is also meant for physicians, but I thought a good chunk of it was clearly explained enough for a somewhat more general audience, especially since a lot of you out there are pretty good about educating yourselves on the disease.

Basically, when I'm too stressed I experience abdominal pain. My GI knows about this, he actually warned me this was likely to happen when I had my first appointment with him after having been released from the hospital - my colon is pretty damaged and he essentially told me that this could happen and that while it's uncomfortable, I don't need to worry about it.

I know that I'm not flaring (no blood and only one BM a day), so this pain is almost definitely stress related, although I'll still bring it up with my GI when we talk next. I just wanted to ask if any of you have the same problem and how you deal with this. At the moment, I have a lot of deadlines at once and I'm really busy which has lead to me experiencing abdominal pain in varying degrees (but never too severe, at most as bad as my period) daily. It's not catastrophic, especially not in comparison to the things I've been through during my first flare, but it's still very uncomfortable. What do you do when you experience this? Is there anything that helps a little, like tea or something? And (most importantly) do you change your diet as you would during a flare or do you eat normally and does it make a difference?

Thanks in advance! :)",2020-08-30 20:15:21

I was incredibly upset over these years as medicine and a diet shift really did ""enough"" but never pulled me out. Always had cramps, couldn't pass gas as there would be a 100% chance of soiling my underwear, etc. 

Recently I got prescribed a taper of Prednisone, nothing new, I'd had it before and it only really extended the time between my stools, turning things to 5 a day instead of 7-8. Things were still wet, cramps, etc. when I had taken it before. This time however my father had put me on two supplements a couple weeks before, N-acetylcysteine and S-Adenosyl Methionine. 

Now I'm passing gas with no mess, I'm not getting cramps(That aren't me holding gas in, I still run to the bathroom and pull down my pants in a stall just in case) I ACTUALLY HAVE CONTROL OF THINGS BACK THERE, and all the stress related to being away from toilets is gone. 

I'm not exactly dreading when the taper starts to go down, or is gone completely, I'm pretty sure I'll be right back to it and I've made peace with that. Right now I'm just enjoying doing things like walking around town and passing gas.",2020-08-30 01:59:05

There are a lot of stories from his colleagues about how they had no idea he was sick. He did a lot of awesome things while he was in great pain and literally dying.

It's so sad.

I hate that people with incurable illnesses have to never complain in order to be taken seriously and be considered strong and inspiring when they die.

I understand why Chadwick Boseman never went public with his illness; I don't resent his decision at all. It was his life, it was private.

But I resent people's reactions to him suffering in silence while doing big things in his life. They take it for granted. They expect it.

I guess I'm triggered because I'm expected to suffer in silence with UC. Whenever I meet new people and they find out I have a painful incurable illness, they expect me to say something brave and inspiring, but all I have is ""It really sucks, it makes my life very difficult."" People are visibly disappointed.

*background info*

my doctor suspects that I have UC. He said he can't really be 100% but that he's pretty sure I do. He told me this about 2 years ago and I've taken asacol since then. I shat blood for months before going to the doctor, dumb choice I know. I took 4 pills in the beginning and I'm now taking 6.


___

Okay, it seems like my UC is very adaptive. When I'm out socializing with friends I often just feel my stomach hurting a bit and that I need to go to the bathroom soon, but I've never had a ""holy shit I'm going to shit myself""-moment where no toilet was nearby.

Two days ago I was out with a few friends, eating pizza, ice cream and just hanging out outside. I was doing cartwheels and being active which usually triggers my shitting reflexes but it felt totally fine. As soon as my friend dropped me off at my house after a few hours my stomach started cramping like crazy. I had to clench my butt cheeks like there's no tomorrow and waddle to the toilet like a penguin not to shit myself and I would've shit myself if I was 3 seconds later to the toilet.

This happens often to me. I feel fine when I'm at work/drinking or just any situation where there's people around but when I get home it all changes. The closer I get to my toilet the worse it gets which has resulted in many close calls.

Do any of you guys have similar experiences? I have no one to talk to about this in real life.",2020-07-01 20:59:06

I’m at 150 now. 

I obviously am careful about what I eat as I don’t eat too much out fear of a flare. Also I eat very specific foods and follow that diet everyday. 

I really need to gain weight and put on muscle, I’m 
becoming scrawny and look like a 14 year old but I’m 21. 

If anybody has any advice on how to gain weight, particularly muscle (more specifically on my upper legs and arms) then please let me know. Any protein supplements that haven’t cause y’all issues, any types of foods that can be eaten in bulk to cause a caloric surplus. Anything helps!

I was prescribed masalamine suppositories, but I'm terrible about taking them. When I first got diagnosed, my symptoms were terrible and kind of unusual (based on my understanding of UC).

The thing is, the medication is incredibly expensive and I am having a really hard time convincing myself to take it when I've gone months without it and haven't had those more severe symptoms come back. 

I guess I'm posting this because I'm not sure if it's fine for me not to take the meds. Is it a guarantee that not taking the meds will make my condition worse?

I spent 2 weeks in the icu and no one knew what was wrong with me. They tried to do a colonoscopy and the stuff you drink before made my blood pressure drop to 50/33 and spike my heart rate to over 130. My potassium bottomed out, it was a whole mess. Finally my scans came back and they said it’s “probably UC”. But because I was going through this right as lockdowns started, I feel like I kinda got pushed to the side. 
I was on a prednisone taper for about a month and I felt better-ish. But then things started to get worse again and when I talked to my dr, she said to do a sample, that I had c-diff and put me on antibiotics. After my antibiotics, I got a yeast infection and Bacterial vaginosis and ended up on more antibiotics, which seemed like it would just make the problem worse. 
But whenever I try to talk to my doctor about how I’m feeling, I feel like I’m getting blown off. My symptoms are getting worse and I’ve changed my diet and trying to do my part, but because I’m new to this, I don’t really know what to do.

So, I just joined and I am excited to be a part of a group of people who “get” me better than the majority of people in my life. 

I’m a 23F and was diagnosed with UC just before my 3rd birthday, so just passed the 20 year mark! A (very) long story short - I was in and out of remission for most of my childhood and ended up with a total colectomy 10 years ago (at 12 years old). Had an ileostomy bag for 9 months before my surgeon stitched me all up and left me with a beautiful j-pouch. I’ve had some minor issues over the past decade, notably I am currently going through a pretty brutal flare of pouchitis, but overall I got extremely lucky with the cards I was dealt. 

I feel compelled to share my story on the chance that my two decades of experience with this shitty disease (no pun intended) can lead me to give anyone useful advice or just be a part of one another’s journeys.

As much as it sucks having an autoimmune disease like UC, I try to look at things from a more positive view...I tend to try to make light of the situation.  Yes this disease sucks, but that doesn't mean we all cant relate to how silly and embarrassing this disease can be.  So lets hear some stories about some embarrassing times that we have had with UC.  Ill start!   


I was diagnosed with UC when I was 17.  I am currently 31, so I have had my experience with different medications, flares, colonoscopies and the dreaded urgency we all tend to feel.  There is nothing worse then having to use the restroom IMMEDIATELY and there isn't one around!  One time my girlfriend and I were taking a road trip to New York city and Niagara falls.  It was around 6 am and we were in some area around Gary Indiana.  We started driving around 3 so we needed a little coffee for a pick me up.  I don;t know how most of you handle coffee, but my stomach was not happy that I just drank a few sips of coffee.  It probably didn't help that it was coffee from McDonalds.  Around 5 minutes after drinking my coffee, it was probably 6:20 am at this point, I felt that need to go.   


As you can guess, its not ideal to be in an area you are not familiar with, at 6:30 in the morning when most businesses are closed.  I started to panic.  My girlfriend and I have been dating for a few years at this point, so she was very understanding of the situation.  We drove around (over the speed limit), looking for a gas station, grocery store...anything that might be open with a public restroom until I couldn't hold it any more.  I noticed a hilly area next to some train tracks that was secluded and decided it was either going to happen there or in the car.  I grabbed some napkins and ran over the hill as fast as I could making sure I was out of sight.     


I then began my ""business"" when the unthinkable happened.   A PASSENGER TRAIN filled with commuters came around the corner and saw me in all my glory.  It was too late, I couldn't stop now!! what was I going to do!???    


I finished up my ""business"" and went back to my car.  My girlfriend was laughing for about 20 minutes (not at my disease but at the comical situation).  She still gives me...shit...to this day!",2020-07-06 20:49:59

Today the hospital IBD team called to confirm they defiantly want me to stop taking Mesalazine (thats the only thing I'm on) for the next 2 weeks... Urmm what?

I blame spicy chips! Once I let my guard down, it’s like my body punishes me for it. 

Had a fecal calprotectin test a bit a while ago and the result said that I am indeed flaring, but when the flare subsided I didn’t get another one because they were supposed to call about it and never did. 

Cases are starting to spike where I live and I don’t feel comfortable going to the doctor and going through a whole ordeal. I live in the US and it’s making me want to find any reason to move to Canada, which obviously isn’t the easiest/cheapest solution, but I have one more year on my family’s insurance before I lose it and I’m afraid of the uncertainty that comes with it and having a chronic illness. I just really hate paying $20 for a fecal calprotectin test, $20 for doctor’s visits, $80 a month for medicine, $100-something for colonoscopies and all that.

6591,"IV issues with remicade, veins clamping, nerve damage(?)",SakasuCircus,3,hmsvjw,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/hmsvjw/iv_issues_with_remicade_veins_clamping_nerve/,8,"Friday the 3rd I had my most recent remicade infusion. I've been getting them for 3 years and only in the last year ish I've had issues every single time where they can't get my veins to open up/accept the catheter or return blood.

They describe it as my veins just clamp down. Of course I try to not tense up to make it worse and do deep breathing to try to calm myself down, but there's always that underlying anxiety of knowing it's gonna happen and I'll have to be stuck 2 to 4 times before they can get a working vein. I try to drink a lot of water before they do the IV to see if that helps but I haven't eaten anything before I get it done because I have to wake up earlier for it than I usually do(night owl here) so I don't usually eat til I'm all settled in and have the meds going.

This infusion though, the nurse who I do really like! tried a spot in the back side of my forearm which we used last time. It gave blood but didn't accept the catheter so she went for a spot in the under side of my forearm just a few inches below the inside of my elbow and my arm all the way from the injection site to my fingers started BURNING and tingling like crazy, and I was very vocal about that. 

She said it likely just pushed on a nerve and was asking if I was okay but didn't want to remove it because she had gotten good blood return and the catheter in and after she taped and flushed it with saline it subsided unless I stretched my arm out too far. 4 days later and I still have nerve problems in the top of my forearm when I do everyday things, extend my arm or flex my fingers.

It's not hindering me much but it's a tight and uncomfortable feeling for sure.

I know next remicade I'm gonna be even more anxious now and idk how long term the nerve issues will be, but I'm pretty frustrated. 

Other than my arm getting cold during the last 15 minutes of my infusion and sometimes accompanied with a burning sensation, I have no poor reactions to the infusions besides getting tired, but my veins just don't wanna cooperate anymore. I already have scar tissue in the inside of my elbow due to long term IV in the hospital when I was in there with colitis paired with routine blood draws(though they usually use my right for blood draws. It's my left side I get used for remicade since i draw or write or mess with my phone with my right hand during infusions) but maybe right side would be more willing next time.


Just venting I guess :v between caring for my reptiles, art, and gaming, i use my left arm a lot so any nerve damage sucks.",2020-07-07 13:34:28

I was diagnosed with severe pancolitis (backwash ileitis; mayo score 3) and was prescribed max dosage of mesalamine and a prednisone taper (40mg 5mg down/week). 

The hospital notes say that if I don't respond well to it, that I must go on entyvio or remicade.

It's now been 1 week since I've finished my prednisone and so far so good? I'm not really sure what's normal anymore but I still definitely feel a hell of a lot better than before. I'm not sure if it's because I still have prednisone in my system or something, or if the mesalamine is truly working.

I've read that mesalamine is not very effective for a severe case like mine so I'm always on high alert. Even minor stomach cramps that go away after 15 mins from eating something wrong makes me really paranoid.

I have two weeks until my next checkup with my GI to see how I am doing. He told me that if I relapse after my prednisone, that he suggests entyvio. I'm hoping I can just stay on mesalamine but I don't think the odds are in my favour.

I don't know. My flare was negatively life-changing and now I'm really scared of having another one. I sometimes wish I could just go ahead and get my colon removed and live with a bag. It sometimes feels like my colon is just a ticking time bomb.",2020-07-07 08:03:34

In the first 8 months I was in complete remission with the use of mesalazine (salofalk), but after that my flares started to became more frequent and I could only get relief by using salofalk enemas, in which they worked really well in the first few times I used them. However towards the end of the last year, my flares became even more persistent and it was aparent that mesalazine alone wasn´t enough anymore to control my inflamation. 

After a recent colonoscopy that I did my doctor prescribed prednisone and so far it´s been a disappointing ride. Im doing 40 mg in the first two weeks before tapering down and so far my inflammation hasn't really gotten any better besides in some few days where improvement were noted but did not stay consistent throughout the upcoming days. Im halfway trough the second week now and I guess im just a bit dissapointed with how ineffective this drug has been for me so far. I know I should´t get my hopes up to much and should always be realistic with this stuff be I guess I just needed to vent a little. I will talk to my doctor this week but I would like to know what you guys think. Should I simply wait it out and let the drug do it´s thing? How long did prednisone take to help you and such?

Basically I had this overwhelming feeling of dread. I mean, I thought I was going to die. I had no symptoms other than anxiety (sweaty palms, couldn't get comfortable, pacing, etc). Heart rate was elevated but not crazy and my blood pressure was higher but once again nothing crazy. I monitored my HR and BP every couple of hours for a few days. I'd be on edge for hours and then suddenly lose all energy and crash hard. Then I'd wake up a few hours later completely wired and the whole time I had this all consuming sense of dread. Now a few months later with things under control I have this unsteadiness. Kind of like brain fog and vertigo but without losing balance. I can stand on one foot with my eyes closed but when I'm walking it's like the world is moving a bit too much and occasional my knees get weak. Is this normal for UC or is something else going on? Some days are fine. I'm waiting till my steroid and double dose of mesalamine is done before jumping to any conclusions. 

Anyway the day after the overwhelming sense of dread in the evening I had my first BM of diarrhea and blood. This freaked me out of course because last July I had C-Diff for a month and it was a living hell. Didn't take long for the fatigue to hit along with stomach cramps. I was scared of a relapse and long story short after many Dr visits, a specialist referral, a colonoscopy and EGD with some biopsies and enough blood tests to make Dracula happy, I got diagnosed with UC. In fact the GI thought that I was most likely in a mild flare up since my C-Diff almost a year ago and something tipped it over the edge. That something would be the Amaretto Sour I had the night before the weird symptoms started. I don't drink alcohol almost ever and that was the first one I'd had since the C-Diff. Anyway now I'm on 8 weeks of Budesonide and a 10 week double dose of Mesalamine before going to a single dose of mesalamine long term. The good news is it worked almost immediately. 24 hours after starting the mesalamine my BM started getting solid but snake like. Now with only a week to go on the budesonide I'm only having 2 BM's a day (something I haven't had since before the C-Diff) and other than this weird brain fog / occasional unsteadiness I'm back to normal.

Still experimenting with diet stuff but the first thing to go was caffeine. It became apparent very quickly that it was a problem. I've started adding in Salmon and VSL #3 probiotic along with some local naturally brined sauerkraut and my guts couldn't be happier. Also started working on calming exercises and stress management. Looking forward to getting over the weird head stuff and maintaining a long remission (as we all hope for).  


Anyway, I guess I'm in the club now.

The pain gets better when I pass gas, which may go on for a few hours.  Sometimes I may have diarrhea 3-5 times a day.  The diarrhea may last 1 day or several days.  Then I may have a day or a few days where I have normal poops or poops that are kind of like mashed potato consistency.  I also notice mucus in some of the stools. When the diarrhea hits it is very urgent. I have never noticed obvious blood, but I recently ordered an at home stool tests that tested positive for blood on 2 occasions.

6662,Do I have UC?,guitarguru12,5,hp0ojf,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/hp0ojf/do_i_have_uc/,9,"My sincere apologies if this question is constantly posted and considered spam, but I'm not sure where else to turn.

I'm trying to diagnose my issue, and got to the point where I looked at an 'organs of the body' image on Google, saw that the pain I experience was around the 'ascending colon' and on Googling 'dull ache in ascending colon', I found this condition.

I'm 32 now, and since about 15 I've had a digestive issue that initially I was taking PPI's for (Omeprazole). This *sort of* addressed the general acid reflux I had, and didn't really think about it again for years (have been calling it GERD since I discovered that term).

For whatever reason, it's only recently that I've actually started to question that diagnosis - all due to the very specific 'dull ache' that I get in my lower right abdomen, typically after eating. It's triggered worse by certain foods - heavy carb, sugary, alcohol - and seems to accompany my reflux.

The thing is, on looking up the symptoms of UC, I don't have any others beside the abdominal pain. Is it still possible I suffer with this condition?

I'm British but now live in the US with a very poor (but still prohibitively expensive) health insurance plan that pretty much rules out going to see a doctor (and during COVID-19, a doctor's is the last place I want to be).

Hopefully somebody here might be able to confirm this, or even point me in the right direction.

After having a pretty mild case of UC for some years managed through oral / enema Mesalamine I’m in the middle of a severe flare confirmed by flex sig (8 months and counting). During this time I’ve cycled through Budesonide, Prednisone, IV steroids and am now on Entyvio. I’m doing better but still not feeling great (frequency 6-10x per day, urgency, unformed / thin stool and mild bleeding / mucus). 

One of the big challenges that I’ve had is that the steroids did absolutely nothing for me (I’ve heard from others and my GI that steroids usually kick in quickly to help induce remission or at the minimum to bridge to a new drug). While I think Entyvio has been helping I haven’t seen much of an improvement over the past 2 months (5 doses in, the past 2 at a 4 week interval) and I’m struggling to wait it out as I realize that it’s a slow acting drug. I don’t want to completely give up on it though because of the finite number of drugs out there and the fact that it’s one of the better ones in terms of its efficacy / long term safety profile.

I’m trying to figure out if there’s a way to be more aggressive with treatment to kick the acute stage of the flare and one of the thoughts that I had was to pair Xeljanz with Entyvio for a short period of time. From what I understand, since Xeljanz is a small molecule vs. a biologic, you theoretically don’t build up antibodies to it and so you can start / stop it, also it has a different pathway vs. Entyvio and unlike Entyvio my GI and others have mentioned that it’s a relatively very fast acting drug (2-14 weeks vs. 6+ months). The one complication is getting the shingles vaccine, which I’d do before starting Xeljanz (this would also give Entyvio more time to kick in).

My idea was essentially to see if I can take Xeljanz alongside Entyvio for up to 3 months, if symptoms improve I’d taper the Xeljanz (10mg 2x daily to 5mg 2x daily and then none) and then let Entyvio do it’s thing. Obviously if I flare up again then I’ll know it was Xeljanz doing the heavy lifting and I’d load back up on it as my maintenance med and stop the Entyvio.

Just hoping to get your thoughts on this approach? My GI has refused to consider Imuran / Methotrexate etc... due to the increased cancer risk for my age / gender group (25M). I realize that this approach is aggressive / unconventional but I’m getting pretty desperate for some relief. Obviously there’s a question about COVID / infection susceptibility while on the 2 drugs as well, I’m fine with that risk. 

Thank you!",2020-07-12 20:50:14

I've called the hospital to see if they upped my dose bc my gp thinks it absolutely could be that, or a bad coincidence of a stomach flu at the same time. 

I sanitize everything so this is frustrating. Have any of you experienced this?? How long if it was Remicade, did it take to go away? I've had rough reactions before but not like this. I think I broke my fever at least.

I've been struggling for almost 2 years to regain control, and seem to cycle in and out of flares. For clarity - ""in a flare"" is bloody and mucus stools 10-14 times a day, ""out of flare"" currently consists if 4-8 BM a day, semi-formed, lots of undigested food, no blood or mucus. Been diagnosed since 2009 and was in remission between 2016-2018

I've been struggling with this tail end for nearly 4 months, and the undigested foods symptom of this flair is causing me to not gain my weight back. I'm currently on a very restricted AIP diet with organic meat, wild caught fish, pureed soups and root vegetables, and blended fruit.  

I keep getting the feeling there's something more going on (since I've never struggled so much at this stage of a flare) but can't seem to figure it out. My biggest problem seems to be lack of digestion. 

Currently on 5-asa orally. GI's suggest stronger meds, but since I'm not bleeding, I'm focused on improving my digestion through food and lifestyles choices before opting for an immunosuppressant.

I swapped from Pentasa to Mezavant early on since Pentasa was giving me weird side effects. I was on Mezavant for 1.5 years but I started developing rashes and my doctor stopped it. He temporarily put me on Cortiment (budesonide), but it started to give me headaches so I stopped the medication. It has been 9-10 weeks since I haven't been on any medication and I am generally feeling okay. My doctor knows about this and he has seen me twice. My blood work has been normal so far and his suggestion was that since I am feeling fine, we don't need to seek another treatment right away. I do have some pain, but it's mild and sporadic. And every now and then my intestines make some serious gargling noises, but nothing else. My bowel movements are normal-ish (no diarrhea, no blood, some mucus).

Everything I read tells me that I shouldn't stop my meds for long as my UC could come back with a vengeance! My next option for treatment are biologic drugs. As a side note, I do plan on getting pregnant within the next year, too.

What have your experiences been with stopping medication?

I am thinking Vedoluzimab might be the best choice for me, but should I be concerned about its risks on pregnancy?

Am I right to be concerned that stopping medication could cause long term problems?

The thing is he wants to do a C. diff stool test (which is also cool with me), but the nurse told me that my stool had to be ""watery"" to put in the little cup. I told her my stool hasn't been watery, like there's mucous (ew, sorry) and that's kinda watery I guess, but the last time I added that to a stool sample my regular doctor said they couldn't test it. 

She told me to ""Just try and see what you can get,"" but there's nothing watery for me to get, and she said if it's not watery they can't test it. I'm not sure what to do! Does anyone have any advice??

Pre diagnosis this was not large quantities but it was frequent and enough blood to get me worried enough to seek medical advice. 

Post diagnosis and colonoscopy I experienced diarrhoea for around 10 days then that settled. I assumed this was caused by the irritation of colonoscopy and biopsies. I was prescribed 9mg cortiment (budesonide) daily. The bleeding was still there and has remained post treatment. 

For the last 10 days (showing no sign of stopping yet) I am opening my bowels and passing a lot of blood and mucus. Many times a day and sometimes through the night. The toilet bowl is left very red and splattered. At the start of this episode I contacted the IBD team and am awaiting blood and stool test results. Stool test was fun - three sample pots that should have been 1/3 full? They got what little solid that I could find. Reminded me of the phrase panning for gold. 

I guess my question is - is this amount and frequency of blood and mucus “normal” or should I be worried about it and seeking more urgent medical care? I am more tired, but this could also be linked to physically returning to work post lockdown and not eating much in the mornings so I don’t have too many my trips to the toilet when at work.

Doc started me on mesalamine (Pentasa) and my symptoms improved within a week. Quantity and frequency of bleeding reduced and tenesmus went away. What Im concerned about is I've been taking meds for 4 months now but I haven't seen a COMPLETE cessation of bleeding. I'd like to go into complete remission. Doc thinks my UC is under control and I dont need to start steroids. How long do you think it would take to go into full remission with mesalamine alone? And should I ask the doc for steroids?",2020-07-16 12:50:07

 I have a niche question for my peers here in the ulcerative colitis community: do you have a cat? Have you had any issues with your health related to the cat? I am  28M, currently on Entyvio and in remission, and have stumbled upon the opportunity to adopt a stray cat. I'm really more of a dog person, but he's a very sweet cat so I'm considering it. My reading has found that the immunocompromised should be cautious around cats because of the risk of toxoplasmosis and other infections, and personally know that I tend to overreact to potential risk factors.

On January 3rd, 2013 I had my colon, rectum, appendix, removed and a j pouch instilled, with a temporary ostomy bag. 6 weeks later I had my bag take down surgery. I was told in the short time before my surgery after all the available meds didn’t work on me that removing my colon was the cure to ulcerative colitis, since there would be no colon for the immune system to attack. I was underage and my parents decided surgery was best. I always had complications. Countless colonoscopy and biopsies to check for any inflammation in the past 8 years and my small intestine tissue was never ulcerative. I was diagnosed with pouchitis and the 2 CM rectal cuff left of problematic tissue constantly became inflamed and it hurt, but not as much as UC. I had complications as I said, a couple more surgeries including getting my gallbladder removed. But a big complication I continued to deal with (and still do) was strictures. In oct 2018 I had emergency surgery for a perforation of the small bowel and lost another 14 inches of intestines. Since then I’ve never felt the same. I also had a C section in feb 2019. Lots of surgery means lots of scar tissue I guess? Every 4 weeks I get symptoms of what I think is a stricture. Having to go, having basic diarrhea like feeling in my stomach (v loud and active and a lot of urgency) only to be blocked off towards the end of my intestines and unable to get anything out. I’ve had colonoscopy to dilate probably 5 times and they usually check my pouch too. My GI doc told me at one point my intestinal passage was the size of a pen and he’d never seen anything like it. Anyway I had the same symptoms again last week, but after the 4th day of not pooping (very weird for someone that usually goes 10 times a day on average) I went to hospital. They did a few scans and a colonoscopy and saw the scartissue structure, and now that my small intestine tissue was absolutely riddled with ulcers and inflammation. But my j pouch looked great and healthy. Now my dr doubled up my humira but for the first time he suggested maybe that we’ll have to abort the pouch and have a permanent bag... and I don’t want that. But I never responded to the meds in 2012 for UC so why would I now for crohns? Has the medicine really come that far? Has anyone else heard or had a case anything like mine? Did anyone give up and just get a permanent bag and did it improve your quality of life? Should I just give up hope that I’ve had since I was so young that I’d ever feel healthy and well again? Thank you for anyone who read this.. I really would like to hear some perspective.

I am 22 and have had UC since I was 13. I had a colectomy and a j-pouch reconstruction when I was 15. I have had issues with proctitis ever since.

Recently (for about 9 months), I have been having very bad stinging stools, especially when my BM is more acidic and watery. I figured this was due to an anal fissure or hemorrhoid or what not. I actually went to the ER toward the beginning of these symptoms because I was going out of the country and felt like I couldn’t sit down, I though for sure I had hemorrhoids. But when the ER doc did a simple scope, he did not see or feel any (although I was yelping in pain but apparently that didn’t matter.) as time went on it got somewhat better and I learned to deal with it and just use tucks wipes regularly. 

However, it got worse recently and I decided to take a look myself. I took some pictures of my anal cavity and I had what seems to be an inflamed bump right on the outside of my anus. I did some investigating online and it looked like an anal skin tag. I told my doctor about it a few weeks ago but he said that because of my proctitis, it may make my inflammation worse if they remove it. However it’s very painful 3/4 times I go to the bathroom.

My doctor's office suggested I appeal.. but I honestly am not sure if it would be a waste of my time.

Has anyone had success appealing a denial to start on Entyvio when they have not had any prior use of biologics, humira, etc.?

I guess I am just a little scared of the side effects that are possible on Humira.. My doctor said Entyvio is considered 'safer' with less risk He already did a peer to peer appeal.

Basically, Humira seems pretty scary to me. I would like to appeal the denial to get Entyvio but it also seems very clear that unless I try Inflectra or Humira they are just going to deny it again.

Has anyone in a similar situation had any success in appealing OR can anyone on Humira help alleviate some of my fears?

Thanks all...

My body got better after a while though my doctor didn't see a lot of improvement of my colon, even though I felt a lot better. My doctor decided that it's necessary that I start taking a biological drug, Humira/Adalimumab. The side effects of the drug are frightening and I know that not everyone might get the side effects.

I recently flared up beginning of May and was promptly put on Mesalamine enemas... that along with my 4 oral lialda a day seemed to shut the small amounts of blood down inside of about 4 days. My recent e-vist with my doc yieled the suggestion to remain on enemas for another month (thus getting a full three months)... I have about 3 or so weeks left of enema therapy before I reportedly am supposed to stop cold turkey (per my GI). 

Over the last week or so, I have been getting a weird pain in my right side. I can't tell if its my colon or not, but comes and goes. It is not overbearing by any means, if I had to diagnose it on a scale of 1-10, I'd say it is at about a 4. So, noticeable. 

My labs recently came back fine. My inflammatory marker is at a 1.7 as of last week, where in the past it has been at a 4 and I had been showing no symptoms, and oddly at a 1.2 when I was flaring last July. 

I have zero symptoms, and am going to the BR 1-2 times a day. I have also been finding that my stools are becoming less and less ""loose"", I.E. I have to put some effort in whereas in the past I would sit down and they would come on their own. 

Should I be concerned with the pain? I did not have any from Friday through yesterday, and today at work I have begun to feel it again.

So I was originally diagnosed with proctitis 3 years ago but my recent colonoscopy revealed I have a small patch outside of the proctitis range that now classifies me as UC. So okay, I have an undeniable autoimmune problem. In conversation I often jokingly say ""yeah my immune system sucks"" or ""if you have a shitty immune system like me..."". It's my way of joking about a strange topic with friends to demystify it for them.

But then my question is this, I virtually never get sick. I don't get colds, I have no working memory of the last time I had the flu, haven't had strep throat since I was a child, I'm not a germaphobe at all, I don't get coughs in the winter. I'm not trying to brag, but I truly do not deal with sicknesses throughout the year in any significant way. Sooooo, on second thought, one would believe my immune system is actually pretty good.

So how does this work exactly? My immune system seems to prevent me from getting sick most of the time, but my autoimmune problem is a clear example of a faulty immune system. Do they not have the 1:1 relationship I'm imagining they do? Thanks for any info in advance!",2020-07-21 18:51:05

So I was on the 1000 mg mesalamine suppository for a few weeks and dicyclomine. For 2-3 weeks this really tempered the 10-12 trips to the bathroom a day and brought it down to 2-3 times a day. I then met with my doc and he added in the delayed release tablets of mesalamine (1.2, 4 times a day). I couldn't handle four because they gave me crazy headaches so I got down at least 2 a day.

About 6 weeks until last week I was making 5-6 bathroom trips a day, diarrhea, blood, but overall still ""mild"". I went away last Thursday and forgot my meds and I panicked a bit but was going to be near bathrooms, etc. Lo and behold, each day I felt subsequently better. Yesterday and today I've been 95% normal.. like December pre-symptom normal. Has anyone else experienced remission without medicine? I have a doctor appt. next week for a check in but I am curious about anyone else's experience.

TLDR: I accidentally stopped meds for 3-4 days, immediately felt like I am entering remission. Hopeful it continues now that I am home and not resuming meds at the moment, seeing doctor within a week for a check in.

I’m an older teen, but last time my doctor had me do one that was about 36 hours total, but it was a pediatric prep, which doesn’t make much sense to me as I’m not a child. I also wasn’t supposed to drink water for 10 hours before, which left me so dehydrated that there was a lot of trouble starting the IV. I’ve heard that most people drink up until a few hours before, but I was supposed to stop drinking at midnight for a 10am procedure. 

I’m asking because I’m going to need another colonoscopy in the near future, but I’m concerned about doing the prep that way again and want to speak to my doctor about it from a place of knowledge. Thanks!",2020-07-22 08:05:47

6822,(20M) Question regarding abnormally high calprotectin,throwaway_42341,3,hvim0x,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/hvim0x/20m_question_regarding_abnormally_high/,2,"Hi everyone! First, a little bit about my situation:

I began experiencing the noticeable symptoms of my first ever flare at the beginning of April. Started with a sudden increase in bathroom frequency, and by mid-May I had a 103 fever and couldn't eat more than two bites of food. Fun!

For extra context, I went to my university's health center back in October 2019 because of blood in my stool. A blood test showed an elevated white blood cell count, but the actual bleeding was related to hemorrhoids. The NP and I dismissed it as my body fighting something off, but now I realize this first flare might have started a long time ago. Like a year ago.

Got my colonoscopy done in May and was diagnosed with moderate-severe UC, which I kinda expected based on all my symptoms and google searches. I'm glad to say that with mesalamine, budesonide, and MMJ my symptoms have become much better! Pain and blood are almost non-existent, stool frequency is down from 15 times a day to 1-3 times, and I can sleep throughout the night! 

Today I was bored and looked at my calprotectin test results from before the colonoscopy (I was REALLY bored). It showed a value of >8000 mcg/g, which I thought was abnormally high compared to what was considered normal. I browsed this sub to see how my results compared to others with UC, and sure enough it seems like most people fall between 100-2000 when flaring. Even the largest value I saw on this sub was less than half of what I got in my results.

Considering I'm not fully in remission, should I be concerned with how insane my results seem compared to others? Am I going through the worst flare of all time? These past few months have been an awful experience, but my flare doesn't seem to be nearly as bad as some of the others I've read about on here.

All of this has been such a strange and confusing experience... I've definitely grown from it though! If anyone has experienced similar calprotectin results or has any advice for my situation, please let me know!",2020-07-22 01:37:17

I’ve recently been thinking about my back pain since my doctor said many with UC also have back pain. Mine is around my buttocks/lower back region, and has been around ever since high school, years before my UC diagnosis and first flare. It can get the point sometimes where it’s debilitating, sometimes in high school I couldn’t even get out of bed and walk down the hallway without immense pain. 
Now it’s better, and this one doctor who said it’s probably linked to muscles helped it the most, more than any other doctor. But then I read online that many UC back diseases are linked to the bones or arthritis, so I’m a bit confused. Anyways, it’s better, but it stops me sometimes, especially with kicking when I try and practice my martial arts. It’s usually at its worst when I flare or when I have my time of the month. Has anyone else had this kind of pain, or even better, had it diagnosed as anything? I’m curious if I should inquire my GI more about the pain.

But every time I try to get something in more than a banana or a Turkey and cheese roll up I just feel full. Like, if I eat anymore I'm gonna be sick.

I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis last Wednesday after my Colonoscopy.

 I have been ""ill"" since about December. But the holidays kept me busy. Then the horrific gas kicked in in January. I made a doctor's appointment in Feb and we discussed my non solid BMs and the really bad gas and that I'm in the restroom for an extended period of time. She told me to try probiotics and sent me on my way. I did those and once the bottle ran out  I didn't buy more since I had not gotten better. 

Then I got this bright idea in May to try Activia yogurt for the probiotics. The first few containers would give me horrible diarrhea a couple times a day. My dumb ass still had one more and that one triggered a really bad reaction. Cramping, nausea, headaches, really bad and multiple times a day diarrhea. I was sick for days. Then got ""better"" but my bowels were worse off. I've had nausea during bowel movements before but now they were frequent. I sent a message to my doctor after a month of the bowel symptoms not getting better and she wanted a tele visit as my symptoms warranted one. At the appointment she referred me to a Gastro  for possible IBS and they booked my visit quickly. Talked to the Gastro and he said he needs to do a colonoscopy. 

Had the procedure last Wednesday and  I was diagnosed. I also have inflammation in my stomach ( is that connected?) And biopsies were taken. Just waiting on the results now. Also turned in my stool samples for testing today.

On one had I'm super happy that we have an answer for my broken stomach, though now I'm devastated. It's a lifelong illness now. I haven't fully processed but am hoping my therapist will help me. 

 I have another life long mental illness and that too took some time to process. It's just now I have two things to worry about and also to be worried about my immune system on top of it.

Current medication is Canasa suppositories 1000MG.

Eating has become a nightmare. I try this and get an immediate reaction, so I try that and get bloating and gas. I can't eat anything. I'm not wanting to just have a plate of meat and no veggies. I'm going to ask for a dietitian referral but in the meantime I've ordered protein shakes. Hey, at least I'll finally lose some weight...silver linings, right?

6839,4 Months Off Humira Medication!,davetherave2108,0,hx639n,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/hx639n/4_months_off_humira_medication/,10,"Edit: This post wasn’t to recommend you coming off your meds especially the way I did. You should definitely follow what your doctor says and take their advice. I only posted this because I thought my whole experience was interesting enough to share and maybe this could work even whilst still on medication, or at least won’t do any harm



Whilst I was at uni on Humira I basically had diarrhoea the whole time with blood here and there, the Humira did stop me from getting a lot worse though but overall I wasn't healthy. But at the start of quarantine here in the UK I was worried about being on immunosuppressants whilst the whole Covid thing was happening, so I thought I'd just risk it and stop taking the injections. At the same time I started the habit of keeping a 2 litre jug by me whilst doing my work and drink it throughout the morning as the govt said to drink more water for Covid and I thought I should probably do it anyway just to be healthier. Within a week I was fully better. To the point my poos were fully hard, no more diarrhoea or blood, I was putting weight back on etc.

This was during exam season for me too which was also really surprising. I had all my exams turn into coursework and I was non stop studying for probably the first 3 months of quarantine, where last time I had exams (for A-Levels) I was pooing pure blood.

What was interesting too was that UC runs in my family, and some people in my family already had some tips and tricks in managing it a bit better. My mum would say that I was to eat only carrot soup whilst I was bad which helped a little and slowed the worsening of it when I did get bad, and my uncle would say to drink 4 cups of black tea which again did work a little but not much. And my grandma said she got my great grandma better with spring water which at the time she told me I just rolled my eyes.

But I think it really was drinking more water which is what was helping. But drinking loads of water to get truly better, not just the little I got from the carrot soup or black tea. When I drink water to the point that I need to wee every 5 minutes (which is probably not even healthy) it gets me better in minimum a week. My farts don't even smell anymore and neither does my stool!

In the middle of this time I thought I'd test it out properly where I'd eat really spicy food for a week, where by the end of it I was bleeding and going multiple times a day as expected, and usually it would just get worse and worse after. But after drinking 2.5+ litres of water per day I was fully better after 3 days.

I've only been drinking an obscene amount of water until I'm better, and then after I just have to drink a normal amount.

But yeah I've been off medication now for 4 and a half months, starting to eat even spicy food here and there, drinking red wine and eating cheese fine, just making sure when I do risky stuff like that to drink the next day.

Tbh when I started of course drinking water at the start made me go more because it just pushes it all down but if you carry on anyway then you might see some results. Thought I might tell you guys now that its been 4 months and I've more or less tested it.",2020-07-24 19:32:13

I went to Mexico for the best gastros in the nation for an affordable cost. A local Mexican doctor was able to tell what I had from just the images of the colonoscopy. I was diagnosed with UC and gastritis. 

I've never really taken my health seriously, as I just used to keep at least one bottle of Pepto in my backpack, room, car, gym bag, etc which would manage it with the help of the toilet. I've had two very bad flare ups which left me bed/toilet ridden for days, both involving a small amount of tequila and nothing else. 

A few years ago I graduated college, and I got a job in construction as a field engineer. It's been tough when I'm at a job site, where I have to pick eat then possibly face the music on a porta potty or be hungry. I'm very fortunate to currently be at a long term job site that literally has toilets within 2-3 minutes walking distance of me in any direction. 

Recently my accidents have been getting more and more frequent, and my list of banned foods/food combos/restaurants has been gradually changing. Food that I once loved to eat, I no longer can without having close calls for the next 4 hours. I just had an accident within 15 minutes of me eating Whataburger as a pick me up due to covid.   

Due to the recent accident, I've come to this subreddit to ask for advice on what you all are doing to control the accidents. How do you tell your loved ones/family that you no longer can eat some of their cooking without hurting their feelings? Also how do you tell co-workers that you can't go out and eat with them during lunch without seeming antisocial?

i was diagnosed with UC in august 2019 after a 9-month severe flare that lasted all throughout my final year of secondary (high) school. 

im not sure if any of you have ever been in a flare while taking 20+ exams over the course of a month, but it is NOT fun, and involved many an embarrassing accident, if im completely honest. during this time, i was at my lowest. i had suffered with depression before, and still do, but during this time it was the worst it has ever been.

after i had finished my exams, and had finished school, i didnt leave my house. i didnt want to meet up with my friends and couldnt give them a real reason why. i could tell my friends were getting sick of this, which made me distance myself from them even more. i barely ate, and lost over 1/7th of my weight. this was all before even enquiring about a diagnosis ! im not sure why i left it so long, when it was as bad as it was. i think part of me thought that if i left it, it might clear up on its own? (i know now this is stupid, dont worry)

fast forward to now, im currently 5 weeks deep into another flare and enemas have failed me. i start budesonide tomorrow (nurse told me that pred is too dangerous right now due to 'rona). i just dont want it to get as bad as it was last time.

im just so sick of being sick. im well aware that my UC isnt as bad as it could be, but im so tired of having to deal with it all the time ! i am a 17 year old girl. i want to be able to hang out with my friends without worrying about the nearest toilet, or bringing a change of underwear ""just in case"". i want to wake up and not be exhausted straight away. i just want to not have this stupid fucking disease.

anyways, im sorry for rambling on, and if youve actually read this, thank you ! and feel free to vent in the comments about whatever!



TL;DR - feeling really sorry for myself, just need to let it all out.",2020-07-24 02:10:59

At this point, I'm on budesonide oral for 3 more weeks (already failed the foam so doc doesn't think oral will work) and then my doc wants to switch to a biologic or the likes. That will be mid-August.

Unfortunately, my current insurance is up at the end of August and I'll need to switch to a new insurance plan 2 weeks after starting the new medicine (probably Humira). It's likely the new insurance will be Medicaid. I'll need to get a PCP (my current plan is PPO so I don't have one), get a referral to the specialist I've already been seeing, and get a prior auth through without disrupting the injection/infusion routine. Does anyone have experience switching insurance (particularly switching to Medicaid) while on Humira or a biosimilar? Any advice for how to navigate this smoothly?",2020-07-24 01:58:51

After a while, the Dr. said it was probably time to get off the Uceris-just in time for Covid! Fine by me to not be on an immune system-nuking steroid during a pandemic...

During the months of treatment and surgical recovery, I slept a lot. I figured this was normal as I was physiologically stressed.

But now that I’m just maintaining Mesalamine and symptom free for some months now, I’m still SO tired. I average 9-10 hours of sleep a day, rolling over my alarms and basically feeling miserable with anything  less.

Symptoms began \~10 years ago when I was a freshman in HS, but literally everyone ignored me. I have extensive(Left side + transverse colon) colitis, moderately active. Histology confirmed UC over Crohn's disease.

I started with 1.6g/mesalamine(Delzicol generic) daily, with 2x 400mg capsules in the morning and at night.Things improved markedly for a about a month, and then I did something very stupid - I drank a fair amount of alcohol. Instant regret, and back in a flareup that lasted for several weeks. Not anemic, but still not fun. I'm sure you all know what it is like. Maaaaaany trips to the bathroom, and blood all the time. Fortunately pain hasn't been too bad.

I called my doc, and we upped my Mesalamine to 2.4g/day. Within a week or two of upping my dose, things started to improve, and by the end of the third week, I was having basically normal BMs. I've been gradually exploring and finding safe foods. Chicken + Rice seems to be safe, and same with applesauce.

However three days ago after eating some Zucchini I noticed a regular( Bristol 3) BM with some blood on it, and in the last two days, I've gone from 3/4 on Bristol to 5-6, one of which had some blood on wipe. I'm only at 1-2 BMs per day. What discomfort I have is mostly located on the bottom left side.

Does this mean I'm failing mesalamine? I plan on calling my doctor Monday one way or the other, but I was wondering if you all had any first hand experience with this stuff. Are enemas worth adding/trying?",2020-07-27 06:10:27

6908,"Been vegan for 8 months (UC for 2 years). Been on an elimination diet for 3 weeks and tried some red meat, my stomach reacted very positively. I feel bad not sticking to veganism, but wondering if it's worth it if a little bit of meat can alleviate symptoms. Anyone else in a similar boat?",Shoemethemonkey,21,hzmd6m,UlcerativeColitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/hzmd6m/been_vegan_for_8_months_uc_for_2_years_been_on_an/,38,"Ok, so a bit of background. I was diagnosed with UC mid 2018. The major flare up that led to the diagnosis was solved by prednizone and some enemas, then mesalamine to manage after the initial treatment. I was eating meat and drinking alcohol and caffeine during this time.

I've had one major flare up mid 2019 that required a hospital visit and further enemas and prednizone. I believe this was caused by excessive caffeine consumption, which made me run to the bathroom very frequently, which eventually became painful, and eventually got out of control. Recovered now not drinking caffeine or alcohol. Was able to remain fairly stable for a while. Aside from that, no changes in diet until late Dec 2019, when I decided to go vegan with my gf.

Fast forward to about 3 months ago. My stomach had been getting worse. I was waking up in the middle of the night, sometimes 3 or 4 times, for emergency bathroom trips, all bloody with little solid substance other than mucus. It progressed and became generally painful for about 2 months before I decided I did not want to go into a debilitating flare up and started an elimination diet.

As I was/am vegan, I cut everything out except for tempeh, leafy greens, peas, and yam. Initially, it was not really working. I started mixing it up; tried subbing or adding potatoes, tofu, beans, corn, carrots, cauliflour, broccoli. I had some minor improvement. About a week ago I was in pain and did not want to cook. I told my gf I was craving a burger, which we hadn't had for a long time. It was the only thing I ate that day.

I was a bit worried as it had bread and meat, but to my surprise my stomach reacted very well. I only woke up once that night. I bought 1lb of cheap steak at the store a couple days later and cooked it a portion of it for lunch. That night I didn't wake up at all.  Anyways, so over the next few days I ate portions of the steak 2 more times this week and at this point I am feeling well enough to work out for the first time in a month. I'm not running to the bathroom. I'm drinking water without cramps. Long story short, I think eating some meat has greatly reduced my symptoms and is actually increasing my quality of life.

I almost can't believe it. Another redditor pointed it out, but vegan food naturally has a lot of fiber as you eat lots of beans and greens, so maybe that has something to do with it. I don't really know though. All I know so far is that in the week or so that I have been eating meat, my UC symptoms have been steadily decreasing. I'm not eating a ton of meat; I still have a 1/2 lb of meat left after 3 days of eating it. I think veganism is excellent for the environment and animal welfare and I'll still try to keep eating most of my meals vegan, but man, a little meat has gone a long way.

**TL/DR:** Had a flare up ramp up in intensity over several months. Ate meat for the first time in 8 months, symptoms reducing almost immediately.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm almost relieved to have discovered this as I am recovering without a doctors intervention.  


EDIT: Woke up to 11 messages this morning. Thanks so much for the engagement everybody. I think going forward, I am going to eat some meat, but keep consumption low; I will also try to find some locally sourced product. Maybe in the future I will go full vegan again, but right now I just want to get my stomach as issue and pain free as possible.",2020-07-28 22:29:48

I’m from the U.K and due to being immunocompromised (Cheers, azathioprine!) I’ve been shielding at my parents house since March! 

I thankfully live in a large area that has very low infection rates / active cases / death rates as of the past month or so meaning I’m infrequently able to get out of the house and meet friends etc.

I’m an anxious person like a lot of people out there so making the step back to the outside world given that a pandemic is still in full force globally is still pretty scary! What I wanted to share with anyone else in a position similar to mine is that despite keeping sufficient distance , washing my hands often, trying to meet outdoors & the overall safe situation in my area as described before etc I’ve on a handful of occasions, after maybe having shortness of breath or a slight cough told myself, “Ah this is it, I shouldn’t have left the house- I’ve caught the virus” and more or less freaked out! 

This is a legitimately scary experience for anyone in my position to go through and the anxiety can essentially have your brain playing tricks on itself ~ making you think you’re unable to breath and thus have the virus when in fact you’re just having a small anxiety attack! 

I’ve been keeping these worries all to myself, dealing with them as they come and go but after finally telling someone I’ve been able to realise that I need to take a step back, group these instances together as anxiety driven freak outs lol and thus better recognise them if they are to happen again! Of course, should any of the recognised symptoms of COVID present themselves they should be taken seriously and followed up on immediately ~ I’m simply trying to help those in my specific situation better adapt to returning to a somewhat normal life!

3 weeks ago I(29M) was diagnosed with PSC and UC (maybe AIH waiting on liver biopsy). It all started about 3.5 months ago in April when I began getting diarrhea and abdominal cramping.  The diarrhea wasn't too bad but sometimes the cramps would get to me.  After many negative tests and visits to the doctors I began to get some PSC symptoms (intense ""stomach"" pain).  These developed to be pretty intense and eventually I checked myself into the hospital.  At the hospital is where I received my diagnosis.  Throughout the 3.5 month period diarrhea and abdominal cramps would come and go but nothing too overwhelming.  My last day in the hospital (the day after my colonoscopy, 07/09) they started me on prednisone.  After leaving the hospital i was on 40mg of prednisone and 4.8g of Lialda and feeling great.

After my follow up appointment a week later I was told to start my taper to 30mg already.  I started my taper on thursday or friday (7/16 or 7/17).  2-3 days later, Sunday 07/19 I got woken up to some gas and COMPLETELY emptied my bowels.  Since then I have been up every night several times throughout the night ""using"" the bathroom.  The first few days were 15+ BMs and it has slowed down a little bit lately but this has been by far the worst diarrhea of my life (thank goodness for a bidet).

After speaking to my GI doctor he feared that I needed to be started on biologics (my insurance did  clear humira).  Since speaking to him throughout the week I have upped my prednisone back to 40mg and have seen a minor improvement (it's been about 4 days).  My GI doc wants me to start the humira immediately, but I am a little hesitant. When I was diagnosed they told me I had mild inflammation and I don't have any blood in my stool.  I have since been limiting my diet to pretty much just oatmeal, rice and eggs.

My main questions are:

1. Could the 10mg drop in prednisone have caused this intense flare?
2. Should I be hesitant about starting humira?
3. Would it be worth exploring a few weeks on 40mg of prednisone to see how I react?

Just curious what other peoples experience's were.  Thanks in advance

I was initially diagnosed with ulcerative colitis back on Dec of 2012. I had a follow up flexible sigmoidoscopy in 2014. Since then my PCP was managing my symptoms. Recently I had a Cat Scan due to kidney stones and incidentally the radiologist found swollen nodes in my perirectal area, and advised that a rectal lesion could not be excluded. Recommended in the report for me to get further evaluation. Immediately my PCP put a referral to see the gastro STAT. I saw him a few days later, all along I was terrified. Crying, not eating cause I was presuming the worst. When I finally saw the gastro last Thursday he basically took my history, reviewed my old results and proceeded to review the Cat Scan report and images. He then asked me to pull up a chair and he went through the entire cat scan inch by inch. He showed me two nodes not a few, he also showed me all the swelling I had, basically he told me that the Cat Scan findings were consistent with my disease. He told me he didn’t see any tumors or growths, but to be safe he would schedule a colonoscopy. I am up for one anyway so I have been put for August 7th.

Now I’ve noticed that I shit an entire colon’s worth every morning... literally I weighed myself before I pooped this morning and there was a 4.5 pound difference afterward. The problem is my body on its own seems to get like a 1/3 of that out on its own, but if I don’t want to have a huge bloated belly all day I need to take laxatives the night before and drink a ton of coffee. Both of which I know are not super healthy and not sustainable. I guess its sort of like constipation, but it’s just weird cause like I said 1/3 of it comes out no problem, but to get all the rest out I have to resort to all these other things.

Is ibuprofen THAT bad, or is the occasional one ok? (If youre willing to take the symptoms) 

Anyone know why we cant? Obviously its an NSAID, so something to do with that presumably.

So question is , whats the delay between you taking something that you know is a trigger for your UC and you seeing a flareup/symptom? Same day? Or a few days later?

Firstly I realise having mild symptoms of colitis is an absolute blessing and I am thankful for that. However, I'd be keen to hear your experiences of flare up and remission as I'm fairly new to this whole thing.

I was diagnosed two years ago.  Fortunately my UC went into remission after treatment and i had nothing for a year. 

Now unfortunately am having a flare up again which has been the last 5 months. The symptoms are not as severe, 3/ 4 bloody stools per day with high urgency ( wfh is a bit of a relief!)

I'm taking 4 mesalazine tablets (4.8g) orally then a suppository before bed (1g).

This isn't working. It's been weeks with no significant change. Does anyone have recommendations for options from here?

I'm tempted to request a change in the treatment plan as its been months by this point. But I also realise some of the treatment options aside from mesalazine are quite disruptive to day to day life also.

I'm new here and i'm just starting to try to understand my condition & had a few questions! I've just started seeing my 3rd GI doc in the past 3 years. Doc #1 said all my symptoms were because of my birth control and i was fine (it wasn't and i'm). Doc #2 gave me mesalamine (Lialda) but never told me I had a diagnosis and never told me to follow up so I haven't been back in 2 years. (I found out last month by looking at medical records that she diagnosed me with Ulcerative Proctitis). I've been on mesalamine 1.2g 2 tabs daily for 2 years with no results. My new GI said ""the dose you're on is kind of like pissing in the ocean"" so he already doubled it to 4 a day & gave me a prednisone script but said not to start it yet (waiting for test results). So my first question is if any of you have had experience with prednisone and could let me know how bad the side effects are (it looks like the script i have is for 10mg 3x daily). 

I've also for years like even before my GI symptoms started had occasional joint pains that show up in different joints every time and are really painful and the doc said it's probably inflammation related to the UC.
Have any of you been able to do anything about the joint pain? I know mesalamine is an NSAID so I can't take advil or aleve and tylenol is basically useless.
