This repository represents the work for my university thesis.
The goal of the project is to discover if there is any correlation between the sentiment in subreddits about Crohn's Disease and COVID-19.

My work follows a previous one made by my thesis relator and another researcher.

### Note

To use reddit apis is mandatory to register the script at [your reddit apps](https://reddit.com/prefs/apps). Registering you'll obtain the infos to access the api.
I suggest to collect the data in a file called **reddit_access** and import its variables whenever necessary.


```
# ./reddit_access.ipynb

client_id=""
client_secret=""
password=""
user_agent=""
username=""
```
