3,Has anyone experienced this? Symptoms changing without medication? Still unsure if I have Crohns or Colitis...,rachelcalabresi,10,k4vpft,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/k4vpft/has_anyone_experienced_this_symptoms_changing/,5,"I hope this message doesn’t upset anyone in this sub, I just am not sure what I have so I thought I would ask if anyone’s experienced something similar. Thanks in advance. 

I’ve slowly come to terms with the fact that I might have some type of irritable bowel disease. One month ago I had diarrhea multiple times a day, horrible cramps, Mucus and blood in my stool, etc. My blood test show a high white blood cell count but my CT scan had no signs of inflammation so my doctor is sending me to do a colonoscopy. 

My colonoscopy is in four weeks, but this past week my symptoms have changed. 
I’m guessing it is because of my change in diet (eating very bland Foods and only drinking water) and now I go to the washroom only twice each morning and they are quite solid. I don’t have cramps anymore just the urge to go when I need to go to the washroom. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night needing to go to the washroom and I don’t have cramps when I wake up in the morning like i used to. 

I’ve began incorporating more things into my diet and have been feeling fine. I ate cookies and fried chicken and fries and this fried dough dessert my grandma makes me and I was doing OK. 

Is it possible I don’t have Crohn’s or colitis or rather something else or am I just somehow going into remission already without any medication or do I have some type of Intestinal or colon cancer? Or is it a parasite that has somehow Went away? Sorry for the long message I’m just a very paranoid individual (clearly). Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks in advance.",2020-12-01 23:24:59

This does not, however, happen if I eat them fried in a pan at medium-high heat for something like 20-30 minutes.

I always thought that fried foods are unhealthy and it's really sad to see that ""healthier"" option is what makes me feel worse.

I usually have a bowel movement once a day in the morning and have been this way for quite a few months - before then I'd go less frequently but I think this is probably just due to a change in diet.

Over the past few weeks I've noticed that my bowel movements seem quite a bit looser than before (often like type 5 on [this chart,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale) but occasionally 2, 3 or 4) and have been slightly narrower than before on average, but not all the time. I've also woken up quite frequently in the morning feeling like I have a lot of gas trapped in my bowels but can't really get rid of it. I've also been getting mild abdominal cramping (usually on the lower left or lower middle) after having a bowel movement but occasionally intermittently throughout the day. It usually goes away after a while. I often feel like I've had an incomplete bowel movement afterwards as well (after I go it feels like I have this pressure in my abdomen and lower back as well), and over the past week I have occasionally had to go to the toilet in the evening as well which isn't really usual for me. I also noticed today that there were a few tiny red flecks in my stool (but nothing red on the toilet paper) and couldn't really tell whether it was blood or pieces of food but it was definitely a little alarming.

One thing I was thinking is that a few weeks ago I ate some food that might have gone off and after I ate it, I woke up the next day with a stomach ache and my bowel movements were a little ""off"" for the next few days. And then I think the symptoms in the above paragraph only really started after that happened, so I don't know if this is a coincidence but I have heard things about stomach infections triggering longer-term conditions.

I would book an appointment with my GP but due to COVID-19 appointments are online and I don't know whether I'd even be able to get an actual appointment, and I have had some digestive issues in the past and don't really fancy the idea of being poked and prodded any more than I already have been. I do realise that asking strangers on the internet isn't a substitute...

I saw that some of these symptoms match up with IBD - does this sound like a possibility?",2020-12-04 11:13:39

It started with getting the flu, like alot. The classic diarrhea, vomited, night sweats ect...Basically once a month I was sick for about a week at the time and had lost about 25lbs in about 4 months. Doctors have always told me I have a weak stomach and thats why I get nauseous so easily and frequently. I had one incident in the middle of the night where I sat down on the toilet and heard what I thought was the sound of me peeing but when I looked down I saw the toilet filled with only blood and it was not my period. I panicked but was too embarrassed to tell my parents so I just went back to sleep. Fast forward to when I was 16. At this point I was quite thin, but nothing too concerning. I was only able to eat when I absolutely had to from the nausea of being hungry but then would be very nauseous after eating as well. Lucky for me I like high calorie foods. It stayed like this until I was 18. At 20 i had another occasion of lots of blood with no bowel movement. I went the the walk in clinic right away and had a rectal exam, nothing was found. I had been getting increasingly worse stomach cramps at this point and more and more frequent diarrhea and blood in my stool almost every time, mostly due to an anal fissure i have had on and off for about 4 years or so. Now, at 21 I am able to eat higher quantities in a sitting but am still left with nausea and very extreme bloating. I take tums after almost everything I eat and sometimes an ibprophen about 30 minutes later to help with cramps. As of today I have been having more and more blood showing up and its clearly not from the fissure anymore as it is simply too much to be from that. Some days im rushing to the bathroom at least once every hour to only pass mucus and some blood. I'm at a breaking point. My whole body hurts, im constantly exhausted and depressed. On the 21st I will be getting my first colonocopy and endoscopy and will have my answer but im not sure im looking forward to it. It'll be good to know whats wrong but I can't help but feel like my whole life is about to change. I'm sure for the better, I just can't shake this feeling of being scared to actually hear the words come put of the doctors mouth.

I started Adalimumab (Hyrimoz, an alternative to Humira) 6 months ago and have now since 2,5 months back had swollen lymph nodes in my neck. I've had them examined at my gastro who also discussed it with a haematologicst as I was very worried about lymphoma. The bloods were fine and they did a CT that showed no enlarged nodes so there will be no further investigation. 
I haven't had an infection that I'm aware of. I did have antibodies for EBV (mono) when tested in june, so now I've been wondering if the immune suppression could have caused a reactivation of the virus and that it would only have caused lymph node swelling instead of other symptoms... or it could be random sequele symptoms from my covid-infection that I had in May (before starting biologics). Seems like a weird time for them to appear though.
Could this just be some kind of a side effect that has not made its way to the package? Do you guys often have nearly unnoticed infections on biologics?",2020-12-08 23:33:55

I have extreme anxiety, so I assume the worst. Finally, after a while, I am told today that the doctor saw “Mild colitis” and “the biopsy showed slight patchiness”. Upon me asking for elaboration, they told me they are just going to refer me to a gastro, AND TO ASK MY MOM ABOUT THE TERMS.

My mom is perplexed as well, because without a diagnosis, she says that what they told me could almost literally mean anything. So now, I am still terrified, and have to wait even more for the gastro to answer the referral.

They officially push conventional methods, while some of the beautiful souls unofficially recommended some unconventionally used methods of treatment, things that I’ve never had mentioned as even an option!

Just thought I’d leave this here if even one person can get any help from them it’s worth it.

I have small bowel Crohn's disease with an unusual presentation and symptoms.  For those of you interested, I'll write a detailed post about my experience in a near future.

Based on my latest imaging exams and capsule endoscopy results, the inflammation is located halfway through my digestive tract down to the terminal ileum. Basically, the disease affects pretty much the whole ileum.

I have a hard time digesting and absorbing food properly, causing me to have all kinds of abnormal stools and intense periombilical, RUQ and back pain. I've been having lots of yellow, orange and greenish mushy stools, with undigested foods and fat. I also have recurrent episodes of massive diarrhea.

I've had my liver, pancreas, gallbladder functions and anatomy verified multiple times through blood tests and imaging ( 2 US, 1 EUS and 3 abdominal CT ) and everything always appeared to be normal. My endoscopic ultrasound was performed by an advanced endoscopist who specializes in hepato-pancreato-biliary diseases and interventions, which reassures me to some degree..

After adjusting my diet and seeing little to no amelioration (low fat, low fibre, 16-8 IF, etc), I decided to add digestive enzymes as a supplement right before having a meal. I've tried Super Enzymes from Now Supplements as well as Enzymedica Digest Gold. To be honest, it hasn't helped much so far.

I was wondering if any of you guys had postive results with them ? Also, could they be harmful for people with IBD ? I've tried to reach my GI by email without success.

If not enzymes, how do you guys manage the malabsorption issues ?

Happy holidays to all !

Both of which have been making me feel terrible pretty much since I took the job . I mainly took the job bc my old place of work kept getting shut down due to the pandemic but also bc I am about to lose my health insurance after my birthday this year since I’ll be off my parents after that . I’m incredibly stressed out and feeling like I have to keep working there for the simple reason that I need health insurance. I do not feel like it’s the best thing for my body as it leaves me exhausted to the point where I sleep 13-14 hours on my off days.  I am in a constant state of fatigue and my job is not helping it at all . I feel like I’m stuck staying at a place that isn’t good for my health just for health insurance and it’s already taking a toll on my health. America really sucks at times . Feeling pretty hopeless right now and just wanted to vent .,2020-12-09 18:25:01

Basically, is it normal for flares to end on their own or am I likely in this until there’s a med change? I take Entocort (9mg/day) and for nearly a year now I’ve had limited to no GI bleeding. In fact, I even got to a good place with stool softeners and had a poop routine. 

Then 10 weeks ago, all hell broke loose. And by loose, I mean my stools. I stopped my stool softeners. Nothing changed. The nausea became intense and after six weeks I caved and got into my Zofran at which point I was constipated for two days. The weird stools have returned now and I’m not sure what my options are doing to be. I have had some bleeding, which I’m monitoring (I take blood thinners as of about four months ago so I have to be extra careful.) 

Do I have any chance of this ending on its own if it is a colitis flare up? I’m trying to adjust my diet but due to gastroparesis and an autoimmune issue, I already have a majorly limited diet. Today there was bleeding and I threw up, so I’m on liquids and maybe rice in a day or so.

53,Two self-care hacks for IBD,KamikazeHamster,23,kaat4i,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/kaat4i/two_selfcare_hacks_for_ibd/,4,"# 1. Wash the toilet every time

This has been a game-changer for me. There is nothing worse than putting on gloves and having to spend a couple of minutes scrubbing the bowl and seat. I hate it!

So instead, every single time I flush, I wait till it's settled and lift the lid to see the damage. It's usually a couple of splatters that line the edges and maybe some collateral damage under the actual seat. But since it's still liquid, using the toilet brush takes less than 20 seconds and it's so freaking easy. I much prefer the wipe-as-you-go method than having to do a big clean-up once a week/month/year/never because you're too tired.

# 2. Saunas are intermediate-level exercise

I listened to Dr Rhonda Patrick on a podcast and she has analysed the studies. [Here is her giant summary page](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/sauna) if you need to see it for yourself. Getting into the sauna lowers your blood pressure but raises your heartbeat to 150pm. Studies show that using a sauna at 80C/176F for 20 minutes, 4-7 times a week decreases all-cause mortality by 40%, after adjusting for all the usual confounders (smoking, alcohol, cancer etc.).

And the best thing is that it really helps release tension and feels more like a spa treatment than a workout.

The only issue I have is that the people in my gym are not great at wearing masks in the sauna. They complain that it's hard to breathe and they are right - sorta. The main issue is that the masks get wet with sweat. I take a dry cloth with me and wipe my face obsessively. I also take a spare mask for the halfway mark. ~~I don't bother wearing one if the room is empty though.~~ You should still wear one if it's empty, like /u/Cromulantman said.",2020-12-10 08:10:28

I have had a relatively sensitive stomach for most of my life but things down there have really gone south since I faced a massive bout of food poisoning while abroad last summer. Since then, my stomach seems to be triggered super easily by pretty much everything, and going to the bathroom is downright miserable. I rarely see blood in the toilet seat or paper, but it feels like knife life cuts that will hurt for the rest of the day, making it really painful to walk. My skin is also super inflamed and angry at me (I’m prone to eczema), and my stomach issues certainly aren’t helping. I saw a GP who said I had a tiny internal hemmeroid (sorry sp) but noted it probably didn’t explain my issues. She suggested eating more fiber and sent me on my way.

I wrote here a while ago about being freshly diagnosed with some form of IBD, still not quite sure which, but my assumption is more leaning towards Crohns these days. Figuring this out was put on the backburner for a while, though, because in the summer I developed acute pancreatitis which led to another bumpy road towards figuring out the cause of that. The surgeons wanted to remove my gallbladder, my gastro finally looked at the MRI pictures and said it looked like an autoimmune pancreatitis treatable with cortisone. So on a fun ride with cortisone I went (turns out, it completely turned off my brain and shoved me into a deep depression hole with the initial high dose, yay).

Anyway, right before going on prednisolone for the pancreatitis (but after two-three months of mesalazine and strict boring diet to baby my pancreas and changing symptoms roughly every two weeks) I had the following symptoms: cramping in the lower abdomen, urgency to fart and simultanuously nausea. All three would subside after a) finding a toilet and producing the most horribly stinking farts or b) waiting it out for a bit. After starting cortisone, this was completely gone from one day to the other and I could also suddenly eat anything and everything without having to suffer afterwards (I could also not forma coherent sentence anymore or understand written text properly, so you win some, you lose some). 

Now, after slowly reducing the prednisolone over the last month or two, these same symptoms have started to reappear. My blood test looks great, but my stool test shows both inflammation and that my pancreas is (still? again?) not working properly. While waiting for my appointment, the doc told me to restart the mesalazine he had me pause while taking cortisone and stay on that latest low dose of prednsiolone until the appointment. 

My question is: Does this weird farting/nausea combo + some diarrhea (interestingly enough mainly in the mornings) sound like an IBD flare up to you or could it also be chalked up to my pancreas being stupid? I'm just so confused by now, haha.",2020-12-12 21:10:12

I'm working with my doctor to (very slowly) figure out the root cause of my digestive issues, and I thought I might post in here in case anyone has any similar experience and could offer some insight. 

Background: I had Graves Disease (hyperthyroid) for several years, but am now in remission. During this time I started reacting strongly to high histamine foods, possibly because of my medication. I'd constantly get hives and vertigo. Most of this resolved once I went into remission and was able to get off my meds. 

In the past few years I've had issues with several food (usually high fiber) that when I eat it I get sharp pains in my stomach that last several days after eating them. This includes oats, eggs, quinoa, and beans. I also can't eat or drink anything with caffeine -- it gives me diarrhea within an hour and makes me feel generally awful. I'm also lactose intolerant. 

My main problem is over the past year I've been having episodes (they started out once a month but now I have them once or twice a week) where, usually after eating breakfast (occasionally after lunch), I get sudden stomach cramps and then am stuck in the bathroom for about an hour with diarrhea and severe lower abdominal pain. Almost immediately I begin to pass out on the toilet (the usual -- ringing ears, profuse sweating, tunnel vision) so I usually have to alternate between sitting on the toilet and between bouts quickly cleaning up and laying on the floor with my feet elevated. Towards the end I get a spasming sensation in my bowels which is super uncomfortable. The next day or two I feel really weak and usually suffer from general abdominal pain and gas. I've passed blood, but only twice in the past year. 

Other important things to note -- I had a blood test that ruled out celiac disease and told me that my ferritin levels were absolutely rock bottom, which is weird because I eat a very iron rich diet (I'm not a vegetarian) and am on birth control that stops my period. I also recently took a CRP test but it came back within normal range -- at 1.5 mg/L. 

If anyone has any insight from their own experiences that might help me in the right direction I'd really appreciate it. It took me years to get a proper diagnosis for Graves Disease, so I'm really being the squeaky wheel this time and bugging my doctor to get me different tests to figure out what's wrong.

Slightly more than a month ago I went to bed feeling fine (after a normal day which included doing a vigorous cycle ride) and then very quickly I had an upset stomach and diarrhea throughout the night. It took me about a week for my stomach to start to settle down, and then another week for all symptoms to go. After i had recovered i went back eating normally and some exercising. Then, this is three weeks after i became ill, i went for a cycle ride (indoor bike) and the next day was ill again and this lasted about 10 days. I also had stool/urine and blood samples done and they all came back normal.

*** Symptoms ***

* Worse in morning and and night. Often wake up in early hours of morning with a little bit of discomfort in stomach (gassy and gurgling) and need to go to toilet. Stomach gurgles a lot and can make me feel a bit nauseous when its really bad. Most of the time goes by evening.

* Walking helps with symptoms.

* The only triggers i have for flare ups are exercise like cycling and jogging and strong coffee, although recently i have been very careful with what i eat.

* Sometimes during worse periods i get cold and shake a lot, especially when pooing.

* Only poo once or twice a day, not that much urgency, but when i do they tend to somewhat relief symptoms. Stools are loose and gassy but no blood and normal color.

The day started with me having to take a poo, which was normal in the beginning then all of a sudden, I had to go back to the bathroom with diarrhea. After that happened, no more poops for the rest of the day, but I experienced tenesmus & trapped gas. Every since that day, I’ve not been myself. Here are my symptoms:

- on a bad day, I have bm 3 maybe 4 times a day. It’s not watery diarrhea, but I would say it’s like a 6 on the Bristol chart.

- some days I fart or pass straight clear mucus. 

- on bad days, I can’t fart without passing stool or mucus

- very gassy

- my symptoms are worse in the morning & I experience anxiety on bad days. 

- usually my symptoms clear up between 12p-3p but I spend the rest of the day with severe tenesmus at times. 

- don’t really have stomach pain. I experience most of the discomfort in my lower intestine/anus region. 

- nausea in the morning when having a flair. Very bad GERD, can smell it on my breath & sometimes my mouth taste bitter.

Does this sound like IBD? 

I am currently taking Culturelle with pre-biotics & hyoscyamine. They have definitely worked some.

Thank you for your comments! 

Also, what should I expect with my first Gastro appointment!",2020-12-14 17:22:25

90,UC - Entyvio/Insurance questions,bluemanrocks,3,kds9av,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/kds9av/uc_entyvioinsurance_questions/,2,"Hi there. I am hoping some among you may have some insight about my incoming insurance situation.

I have just started Entyvio and due to COVID must change insurances for next year. I live in NYC and also due to COVID my projected income is low enough next year to qualify for subsidy for my insurance. I could *maybe* even qualify for medicaid if I project my income a certain way (I qualify as self-employed and the way they ask you to project income allows for different interpretations), but my doc thinks it will be harder for me to escalate therapy if needed and unfortunately that is a very real possibility as my UC has not been great for the past year.

I am under 30 and qualify for a catastrophic plan, where my subsidy wouldn't apply towards my premium (would be around $250/month) but after deductible/OOPM everything is free.

I also qualify for a few more standard plans, one with an extremely low premium after subsidy (something like $25/month) but with a %-based co-insurance which I'm a little confused about and another with a higher premium after subsidy (closer to $250, like the catastrophic) but flat fee co-insurances/co-pays.

A problem I keep running into is that I need to judge what the cumulative admin fees will be for each of these plans assuming it takes me 1-3 infusions of Entyvio to reach my OOPM and make subsequent care free, but neither Entyvio nor the insurance companies seem to have the answer. I can't believe that I would really have to ""guess"" which one is lowest when the consequence to guessing wrong is thousands of dollars... I will find a way to make it work no matter what, but I'm sure there's a better way that I just haven't heard of.

Thank you to anyone who has any insight on this - it is hugely needed and appreciated!!",2020-12-15 20:15:21

94,Is it Crohn's? I seem to be somewhat of a mystery...,rosesandfoxes,1,kdftqi,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/kdftqi/is_it_crohns_i_seem_to_be_somewhat_of_a_mystery/,9,"Long story incoming, so grab some stomach-friendly snacks and strap in.

I'm a 19 year old college student. Before this started I was relatively healthy--notorious yo-yo dieter, but was eating pretty well at school and not going \*\*too\*\* crazy on weekends. Coming home for Winter Break, I ended up coming down with a pretty severe sinus infection right before I was about to go back to school in late January. Doc wanted to knock it out quick, so I was prescribed a Z-Pac and a short course of Prednisone to clear up the infection.

Once I got off the meds, I started having insanely bad GERD symptoms (heartburn/acid reflux) which I had rarely dealt with previously. GI recommended Pepcid twice a day and Tums/Mylanta as needed. Did nothing. Ramped up treatment to taking a 2 week course of Prilosec, which also, surprise surprise...did nothing. Moved onto Nexium after that, and that’s when the real problems started.

Every time I ate I would get severe stomach pain and bloating. Like, 6 months pregnant and writhing in pain. Meanwhile I’m at college trying to eat dining hall food. At this point I relegate my diet to boiled unseasoned chicken, bananas, and raw unseasoned tofu, but don't really mind because I hardly have any appetite anyways.

Things were bad, so I ended up leaving school for a week in February to get testing done. Colonoscopy/endoscopy showed *mild active ileitis, chronic peptic duodenitis, and chronic active gastritis.* Doc didn’t think it was Crohn’s, though, as blood inflammation markers were not even close to elevated and biopsy findings were, once again, mild. I was also tested for ova/parasites, H.Pylori, C. Diff, and Celiac (which I should mention my sister has). All were negative.

Because my symptoms were mainly bloating and abdominal pain, though, GI suspects Hydrogen-dominant SIBO and puts me on Xifaxan. I go back to school and start the medication. Surprise surprise...it does nothing, and my symptoms continue for the rest of the semester.

Home due to the pandemic, I am now able to see doctors more easily, and decide to consult a naturopath/holistic practitioner as the western medicine route seemed to be failing me. She orders a comprehensive stool analysis, this which showed my microbiome to be incredibly diseased and out of wack (all of my levels were either too high or too low, I had virtually zero beneficial gut flora, and had pathogenic bacteria overgrowing (Citrobacter)). So, she decides to put me on a natural antibiotic (Candibactin) for 2 months. I felt absolutely horrible on it (nauseous everyday, weak stomach, no appetite, etc), but did notice a slight reduction in symptoms after completing the course.

Since then I’ve still be experiencing all of my symptoms in/at varying degrees every single day of my life. My reflux is unrelenting, my stomach feels constantly irritated, and I more often than not end the night with a severely inflamed and bloated stomach. My diet is still incredibly limited (soaked/overnight oats, peanut butter, rice cakes, bananas, tofu--NO MEAT, DAIRY, GLUTEN, PROCESSED SUGAR OR FOODS, SPICES, COOKING OILS, ETC), though I am eating more and have more of an appetite thankfully. I have also started exercising more and feel stronger in my body, though there are definitely days that my symptoms are debilitating and confine me to my bed.

Almost as a last ditch effort, my GI ordered the Crohn's Monitr test for me last week. Though the test is not meant to diagnose Crohn's, it surprisingly showed up with an elevated number (40 out of 100), this which indicated ""Increasing likelihood of endoscopically active disease, whatever that means. (For any sciency people, the only biomarker that was abnormal was my EMMPRIN, this which resulted in the elevated score). So now I don’t know what to think. Could this just be really bad IBS that's been flaring for almost a year, or is it Crohn's despite the fact that I have presented with very few of the typical symptoms, and have no inflammatory markers?",2020-12-15 06:41:15

However recently I have learnt through genetic testing that my dad is not my biological parent and I was conceived via sperm donor. My half sister I found has the same food sensitivities as me as well as an esophageal condition. Neither of us have allergies or digestive issues on our moms' sides of the family. We're both convinced our health issues are on our bio dad's side of the family (funny enough both our brothers have no health problems). 

All this genetic stuff got me curious and now I want to know if you have IBD in your family or if you're the first! If you do, please mention if you have Crohn's and/ or UC and what your family member has.

For context I am in my early 20s, have had generally good health. Towards the end of last year (2019) I started getting IBD symptoms for the first time (bloody bowel movements with urgency multiple times a day). After a few unhelpful visits with urgent cares I had a colonoscopy and was admitted to the hospital with moderate/sever colitis after ~3 weeks of symptoms. The scoping showed inflammation throughout my large intestine, with it being a little worse in the beginning of my colon near the small intestine and more mild in the rectum. There was a tiny bit (basically one ulceration) in the end of the small intestine. I was diagnosed with Crohn’s, although there was some ‘pretty sure’-ness about it. I received two large doses of Remicade but was unresponsive, and after ~3 weeks in the hospital had a total colectomy (just the rectum left), and have an end-ileostomy. 

I had planned to have an IRA (just connect the end of the small intestine to the rectum) as a reconnection surgery, but the pandemic got in the way. In the meantime I visited a handful of other doctors, all of whom categorized my IBD as Ulcerative Colitis or Indeterminate, and nearly all recommended a J-Pouch instead of the IRA (due to presentation, pathology, current symptoms etc). 

At this point I am pretty sold on the UC/J-Pouch diagnosis/plan (I really trust my current GI doc), but I just felt like it might be a good idea to make this post as some form of due diligence. In particular I am curious if anyone had a similarly aggressive first flare or has been re-diagnosed (especially Crohn’s -> UC)?

TLDR: Last year went from first symptoms to total colectomy in ~6 weeks. Want to see if anyone had a similar experience or has any experience with a Crohn’s -> UC re-diagnosis. And also reconnection surgery thoughts/advice?",2020-12-17 18:53:31

I am currently looking for guidance/advice. 

Back in early August I began to have symptoms of what was believed to be food poisoning; diarrhea and mild abdominal pain. 

About a week later, I woke in the middle of night to an extremely intense stabbing (?) pain isolated to my left side. Alongside this, I experienced painful gas, nausea, and dry-heaving. I went to the ER and had a CT done; there was inflammation on the side of my colon. The ER doctor told me it was likely an infection and gave me Flagyl, Bentyl, an anti-acid, and Zofran. After seven days of medication, I still wasn't feeling any better. 

I visited my primary-care doctor and she referred me to a GI. 

While waiting for my visit, I had gone to the ER on two separate occasions. During those visits, I received another CT scan and an x-ray; both showed constipation, no inflammation. 

During my first GI appointment, the PA requested that I have a upper endoscopy done... Nothing of significance was found. I had a stool test and some blood work done. The only thing found was that I had an e.coli infection.

Went for my second office appointment and the PA ordered a colonoscopy. Just had that today. Was told that my colon looked normal. A biopsy was taken but I won't see the results until next week. In addition to that, I don't have another office appointment until 1/18/21.

While waiting for my colonoscopy (3 months) I had two pelvic exams. Nothing of significance was found there either. 

My current symptoms are: pelvic pain (left), abdominal pain (left, sometimes right), rectal pain (pressure and not relieved by bowel movements), constipation, bloating, nausea, and back pain. I also experienced joint pain the last time the abdominal pain got really bad, but I don't think that's related. No food restrictions apart from those high in fiber (dried fruits, wheat, etc.) 

**If my symptoms aren't being caused by UC, Crohns, or gynecological issues (all suggested as potential culprits), then what could it be? Should I get a second opinion?**

The PA suggested that it could be IBS. However, my PCD doesn't believe that to be the case because I am taking amitriptyline, a medication commonly used treat IBS (at a higher dosage).

I would really appreciate any advice or input you all may have. Feel free to ask me questions. Thanks in advance! :)",2020-12-17 18:45:24

After 10+ years of trying to figure out my GI problems I think I am really starting to believe some of the doctors. That I am just crazy, I have IBS and I just don’t know how to handle it. Last time they took biopsies was 2013 and it did show chronic inflammation but at that time I also had ulcers but ended up being positive for salmonella, so that just complicated everything. I really don’t know what to do anymore. 

I just don’t see how IBS could cause some of my symptoms... especially with the debilitating increase I have seen over the last 10 months. 

-frequent low grade fevers

-joint pain in large joints, especially my sacroilliac and hips

-eye inflammation, 

-unintentional average of 6lbs a month weight loss (which my GP praised since I am overweight and “it isn’t more than what a person who was deliberately losing weight would lose”... really?)

- dehydration and electrolyte loss with ekg changes, requiring IV fluids sometimes on a weekly basis
- unexplained iron deficiency and inability to tolerate oral supplements (haven’t been offered any other supplement so I have been deficient for months)
- chronic fatigue, some days I have to “take steps” to put my hair in a ponytail because it is my too exhausting. Taking a shower and getting myself to a bathroom is torture.
- chronically elevated CRP, Sed rate, WBCs and PLTs
- chronic sores/ulcers in nose and mouth frequently accompanied with thrush (yeast infections)

Then I have the obvious abdominal pain (left upper and lower), sometimes worse with eating sometimes worse if I don’t eat so I can’t win there. Nausea/vomiting made worse by pain. Bowel urgency/Tenesmus. Chronic yellow acidic diarrhea but occasionally suffer with “constipation”, kind of. Difficulty swallowing. GERD with increased symptoms at night, I wake up with regurgitation. I do not have celiacs. Vegetables and food with fiber... forget it.

But... I haven’t seen actual blood in my stool in a few years (though no one has recently done an occlut test) and apparently my lactoferrin was negative? Rheumatology already looked at me this summer and said they couldn’t find anything in their department.

This got longer than I intended. I need your ideas and experiences. Could Microscopic colitis wreak this much havoc? Could the rest of my GI tract look fine but I still have an issue in my small intestine that they couldn’t see with the scopes?

EDIT: wanted to add that in 2013 (as mentioned), for about a year and half they treated me for ulcerative colitis with a course of prednisone, Apriso and mesalamine enemas. It was the best my GI symptoms have ever been, not “perfect” but the best. After the year and a half of treatment the GI I was seeing decided he wasn’t comfortable treating me because at the time I was diagnosed I also had the concurrent salmonella infection and he felt my symptoms were due to the infection and IBS rather than IBD. He stopped my treatment. I feel like I have declined every year since treatment ceased.",2020-12-17 18:31:36

I'm still an on Lialda but it has never put me in remission and I stopped seeing my previous GI doc.

I've learned a ton about health and nutrition through my journey and know that even if I'm on harder pharmaceuticals I will continue to eat clean and take care of myself.

But the thing is I'm so scared of them l, especially biologics. I tried so hard to avoid heavy meds but I'm afraid I'm going to cause more damage with the way things are currently going on holistic route.

In my current health state, IBD is affecting my life more and more to the point where I can't hold onto jobs or be reliable like I once was. It kills me.

I've never been in true remission sauce my diagnosis in 2017.. sometimes I'll get formed bms for a a few weeks but then I fall back to sleep (urgent and frequent watery BMs with mucos, brain fog/fatigue, gut discomfort/pain sometimes, massive indigestion especially with veggies, lose weight easily, inflammation in the colon, etc )

Can you help ease my worries about meds, if possible?... Any good outcomes from heavier meds and then helping you get your life back?..

So I know you guys aren't doctors but I thought maybe this would help me settle some anxiety (or worsen it lol). So for the past two years, I have had intermittent mucus in my stool, which I think is usually triggered by my period just because it happens usually once a month. In the fall of last year, I started getting these black specks in my poop that showed up no matter what I ate. It subsided eventually so the gi specialist I was referred to this summer gave me the choice of doing a colonoscopy/endoscopy, and I decided against it just because the problem was no longer active. Fast forward to this fall, I am having chronic diarrhea, mucus in my stool more often, and an overall loss of appetite. I have lost 18 lbs due to this loss of appetite over the course of three months. Also, when I eat, I feel nauseous about 30 minutes after, like I could throw up, but never do (doesn't matter what I eat). I also have had some fresh blood in my stool (in the stool and when I wipe) which I originally attributed to hemorrhoids but now I am not so sure. A few days ago, when I went to the bathroom I had black, tarry stool, and decided to go to the er to make sure it wasn't an upper intestinal bleed. My blood numbers checked out, so they released me (they checked for blood in my stool but I still don't have those results cause the ""machine was down for maintenance"" (?)). I also, for the past few weeks, have been experiencing minor cramping after eating mainly on the right side of my belly button and under my left rib. The cramping under my left rib isn't necessarily painful, but it feels like someone is blowing up a balloon underneath my rib which sounds weird lol. 

Anyways, the er doc told me to go see the gi specialist again and get scoped, as she suspects chron's or uc. My sister who is a nurse also said what I am experiencing could very well be ibd. 

I just wanted to get your guys' take just because everything online emphasizes a lot of pain. The cramping I feel isn't exactly the worst pain of my life, but it definitely is very very annoying. What do you guys think? I know you aren't doctors and I am going to see one soon but I thought posting on here may give me a better idea of what to expect.

So I was diagnosed with moderate ulcerative colitis in 2017. My doctor at that time put me on Prednisone (which I had bad side effects) + Imuran, then Lialda and Uceris later.

Those seemed to do okish but definitely never put me into remission at all.. I decided to just stick to the one med that was giving me the best results (Lialda at that time) and ditch the others. I then decided to go holistic (while still on Lialda) to see if I can get into long term remission that way.

After 2 years trying the holistic approach I'm throwing in the towel... Even though I'm still on Lialda, I have failed to get into remission since my diagnosis 3 years ago. 

With the holistic approach, I gave myself a cut off of two years because I believe I should have seen a decent direction of where my health is going by now.. unfortunately it has been a roller coaster of symptoms still and IBD is still haunting me. Once in a blue moon I'll get a good week but that's about it. And I'm now extremely limited on what I can eat (it's too strict and not an enjoyable lifestyle). And the worst part is I am being very strict but I'm still experiences debilitating IBD symptoms. It's affected me from landing a career and it's affected my relationships around me. Even though I wasn't able to get into remission holistically, I still learned a lot about health and nutrition and I did managed to stop all the bleeding with holistic methods (haven't bled in 2 years) but all the other symptoms are still there and it flares up and down constantly.

So I'm sticking to my guns and respecting my cut-off timeline that I made for myself for the holistic stuff and I am now looking to go the pharmaceutical route with my doc (but of course will still try and live a healthy lifestyle through diet & nutrition).

My question is, since I've been on a Prednisone, Imuran, Lialda, and Uceris. What is the next stage of medications after those and has anyone gotten good results from medications like these (pills) or is the next step biologics?

Also, what has worked for you to get into long term remission?

TL;DR
I was diagnosed with IBD (UC) in 2017
I did a handful of meds the first year (Prednisone, Imuran, Lialda, Uceris) but they failed to put me into remission so I wanted to try a holistic approach.
I've been holistic (while on just Lialda) for two years now and I have still never seen remission.

My symptoms were bleeding, mucus, and an intense, horrible pain that came and went on my lower left abdomen that brought me to my knees. I only occasionally had pain on my right side.

I was prescribed mesalamine. It has helped with the left side pain and lower back pain and I don't bleed anymore. However, I now have an intense, unbearable pain on the right side of my waist that wraps around my back. It's worse than the old pain. Occasional pain on my left upper abdomen. It can't be my colon because only my rectum is inflamed and the colonoscopy didn't find anything else.

I'm very careful about what I eat so I only consume safe foods. Has anyone else experienced this? What is causing this pain?

The pain has gone away after lasting for what felt like an hour but I'm left with a sense of fullness at the site of pain, although it doesn't look swollen from the outside.",2020-12-28 02:34:25

The other thinks its IBS and despite me telling him my attacks last for days and wake me up at night and I find zero relief half the time, he is convinced.

Let me first say this is not a survey, or anything that will be used for research (I ran it by the mods prior to posting). I work with IBD physicians regularly, and we are trying to engage patients to get their opinion about problems they have that are not currently addressed. Essentially, we want to brainstorm, so perhaps in the future we can create resources that would help our patients. Would very much appreciate your opinions on anything and everything. A few questions perhaps to get started:

Is there anything (eg. resources) your physicians don't or can't provide you with?

Do you have regular longitudinal access to your doctors?

If you need to quickly run something by your IBD doctor, are they easy to get in touch with?

Do you ever with there was something similar to the r subreddit, ""askdocs"", for IBD?

Do you feel like you have access to and knowledge about current clinical trials?

 Would you like that?

Do you feel like you understand your disease fully? 

Would you like further educational resources?

Do you feel like you have access to, and understand, all the tests that are done for IBD?

My main symptom was bright red rectal bleeding. Enough to turn all the water in the toilet dark red. 5 months ago, I started 40mg of Prednisone. 

The inflammation did NOT respond to the Prednisone, so my doc wants to start me on Humira. However, going over my overall health, I mentioned to him I have a cavity/decayed tooth so we had to postpone treatment until I get note from the dentist reassuring my GI that there is no risk of infection (since the humira makes it harder to fight them off). My dentist appointment is on Jan 5th.

I’m still on the Prednisone 40mg even though the inflammation didn’t respond. The side effects i’ve noticed are increased appetite, some acne, a little trouble sleeping, and my blood pressure has been a little raised (I check it regularly at home). But out of nowhere, the passed 3 weeks my symptoms have gotten better. Only small amounts of blood on the toilet paper afterwards compared to 3-4 weeks ago when all the water was red. 

Now, my mother (whom I live with) was diagnosed with Coronavirus. I’m terrified I might catch it. Will being on Prednisone 40mg make it easier for me to get it? Will it make my symptoms more severe?

I am at day 12 of the first step-down of the dosage.

Last week, about 36 hours into the reduction of dosage, I experienced a highly stressful five days, thanks to some plumbing issues (two days without water, two more days without hot water), and concomitant financial stress due to the high plumbing bills.  I am also autistic and have sensory issues, and going without showering for that many days created a level of discomfort that also significantly contributed to my stress level (in fact, just thinking about it right now raises my heart rate).

Once the situation resolved I slept 10 hours per night for five nights in a row, yet I woke every morning feeling exhausted - like I needed a good night's sleep.  I was not depressed or anxious, but I was so wrung out that I could barely move, and I also experienced several orthostatic episodes (postural hypotension) just going through my day.

I'm going to assume that a lot of this is due to the transient deficiency in adrenal hormones as the taper proceeds, but I'm nervous about the episodes of dizziness and light-headedness.  I'm afraid to have one while I'm driving my car, working with tools or the like.

Does anyone here have experience with the side effects of steroid taper?  What did you do to mitigate them?

No parasites or bacteria found
Calprotectine was 200

Warning: English is not my native language (sorry)

A very concerned 40 year old man here.

First some background information:
For 15 years,  now and then, loose stools (sometimes water-thin but mostly mushy with mucous). Some weeks /months goed with no problems and sometimes out of the blue mushy or watery dhiarrea. It mostly resolved in 1-2 days. In 2007-2008 I had a lot of diarrhea for some days and after that it resulted in an anal fissures and external hemmeroids.

I always Had sometimes some  blood on the toilet paper every now and then. 2-3 times a year. Usually the area around my rectum was then I ritated / itchy. I wasn't worried about it.  Because I thought it was the hemmeroids or anal fissure. I also suffer with hypochondria and this has gotten much better in recent years but since COVID it is full blow back.  To summarize: I mostly blamed my bowel movements as a classic PDS story (was what the doctor said).

fast forward:
Problems started since July 2021. I had maybe a couple of weeks normal BM (on and off) but mostly mushy.  Occasionally hard turds, some of which are very hard (number 2 on stool chart). Also often with mucus (white). At the same time a lot of stress because I thought  I had colon cancer and thought my mum had brain cancer (luckily this was not the case). Lost my father when i was 10. My doctor, however, did not want to listen to me and found me a “nag” and said my problems came from the stress.  found a new doctor and wasn’t worried eather and wanted to reassure me and she tested my stool for: parasites and bacteria, occult blood and calprotectin. Everything was good except the 200 calprotectin. I was quite surprised about the “no occult found” because the day before I got my stool sample there was quite a lot of blood on the toilet paper (not on my stool, so maybe my sore rectum again).

At first I was relieved because I was particularly concerned about the occult blood (in the Netherlands it’s a wide known screening method for 55+). That This has not been found was a good sign that do not have cancer (iam aware of false negatives). A few hours after the occult blood result, I was called by the doctor who told me that my calprotectin is too high and she referred me for a colonoscopy. But told me that she was not worried for cancer, she even told me, that was the last thing I think about due your age and told me i probably have an inflammation. after this message I was somewhat reassured and thought ""well better inflammation than cancer"".

However, after some googling, I saw some very disturbing studies that really convinced me that I have colon cancer. And Since the news that i heared about the elevated calprotectin levels I feel a constant pain right above my belly button. Another symptom I had quite often the last year but forgot about it and I have 24/7 (only not when I just wake up) rectal pressure (Tenemus). 

Tomorrow, Thursday, October 7, I have a colonoscopy and in the meantime I am preparing myself for the message. “Dear sir, I have very bad news”. No other outcome is possible in my head.  An inflammation or ulcerative colitis seems too coincidental to me and certainly for my age. Especially with CU it seems to me that this should have been noticed earlier and i must have much more pain. What i have  now is more subtle. Don't have a lot of cramps and never a fever. And that concerns me, a lot. I also think that i am way to late to found out that it is cancer and will not be curable anymore. 15 years of problems. 

I don’t really have any questions, but am looking for support. Iam so afraid and feel mostly sad for my mom and girlfriend. My mum has only me. No siblings or family and no husband. She will die if I will become sick and pass away. 

My girlfriend and I where just wanted to take the next step. Next week she will move into my house and will stop anticonception. She told me that she knows 99 percent I would not have cancer (I know it for 99% i have it). She keeps talking about the future but all I can think of is how afraid I am to die, hear that it’s cancer and how my mum will react.

There are to studies I found disturbing. 

One is a link:

https://bjgp.org/content/66/648/e499

All colon cancer patients have high calprotectine. In the range 100-400. I I know that IBD’s are much higher 600+).


And here  is a extract of a research


In short, the research claims it
Next: research that the calprotectin test detects more colon cancer than the occult blood test. So it matches my situation

Also found out that all people with bowel cancer have elevated calprotectine levels.

Results—Median faecal calprotectin concentration in the 62 patients with colorectal carcinoma (101 mg/l, 95% confidence interval (CI) 57–133) diVered significantly from normal (2.3 mg/l, 95% CI 1.6–5.0 ) with 90% of patients having elevated levels (normal <10 mg/l) whereas only 36/62 (58%) had positive faecal occult bloods. There was no significant difference in faecal calprotectin levels when considering location or Dukes' staging of tumour. Percentage positivity of faecal occult bloods was significantly higher for Dukes' stage C and D cancers compared with Dukes' A and B. In the colonoscopy group, 29 patients with adenomatous polyps were detected in whom the median faecal calprotectin was 12 mg/l (95% CI 2.9–32).

But I’ve been in a lot of pain the past few months so I went to see a new gastro for a colonoscopy.

I get the pathology report and it appears there is inflammatory bowel disease (I would assume that is consistent with Crohns) but her notes do not say that. Her notes say that only mild inflammation was seen and to come back in two years for another scope. Huh? What do you make of this lab result - can someone with more experience help me here (and I think I need a new doc)? Copy/paste:

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A: Ileum, biopsy:
Small intestinal mucosa without significant abnormalities.
B: Right colon, biopsy:
Colonic mucosa with mild reactive epithelial changes and patchy, mild
chronic active inflammation in the lamina propria.
No granulomas, infectious organisms or dysplasia identified.
C: Transverse colon, biopsy:
Patchy mild chronic active inflammation with crypt injury in one of five
biopsies
No granulomas, infectious organisms or dysplasia identified.
D: Left colon, biopsy:
Colonic mucosa without significant chronic active inflammation or crypt
distortion.
No granulomas, infectious organisms or dysplasia identified.
E: Sigmoid colon, polyps:
Tubular adenoma (one biopsy).
Colonic mucosa (one biopsy) with reactive epithelial changes, mild
chronic inflammation and fibrosis in the lamina propria with mild crypt
distortion; possible post-inflammatory polyp.
Features of invasive carcinoma are not identified.
F: Rectum, biopsy:
Rectal mucosa without significant chronic active inflammation or crypt
distortion.
No granulomas, infectious organisms or dysplasia identified.
COMMENT:
The biopsies from the ileum (A) demonstrate preservation of the normal
villous architecture with normal cellularity in the lamina propria.
Reactive lymphoid aggregates are focally present.  The expected numbers
of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and scattered eosinophils are present in
the lamina propria.  There are no features of significant active
inflammation, fissuring ulceration, erosions or focal mucosal injury.
No granulomas or infectious organisms identified.  Multiple biopsies are
evaluated from the right colon (B), transverse colon (E), left: (D) and
rectum (F).  The biopsies show colorectal mucosa with patchy chronic
active inflammation variably present in some of the biopsy tissue in the
right colon (B) and transverse colon (C).  The remaining biopsies in the
left colon and rectum show minimal inflammatory changes.  The
cellularity in the lamina propria appears focally increased within the
involved biopsies in the right colon and transverse colon.  Throughout
the rest of the colon biopsies there is no significant increase in the
inflammatory cells in the lamina propria.  The focal areas of increased
inflammation in the right colon and transverse colon show mixture of
eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells and lymphocytes.  There is focal
cryptitis in these areas.  No significant acute inflammation with
cryptitis or crypt abscess formation is seen in the remaining biopsies
in the right colon and transverse colon.  No significant inflammation is
seen in the left colon or rectum.  No significant distortion or
branching in the crypt architecture is seen throughout.  No infectious
organisms or granulomas are seen.  No evidence of dysplasia is
identified.  These findings can occur in mostly quiescent or focally
active idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease.",2021-10-07 05:31:19

**we’re making an appt with the gastroenterologist, but that won’t be for a few months and he’s honestly not very helpful**
My husband (35) was diagnosed with colitis about a year ago, after a colonoscopy. He had been having bloody poops, and only pooping like twice a week.
He’s been taking medication (mesalamine 400mg) but he’s still experiencing bloody poops. The one thing that’s changed is that he’s gone from pooping 2 times a week to 2-3 times a day. It’s not diarrhea, but it wasn’t before either.

In all of my brilliance, I transitioned us to a vegan diet. Now I know that was kind of dumb… his bloody poops have maybe slightly increased, but he’s not having painful diarrhea…? 
He’s leaning heavily on chia seeds and almonds, which we’ll cut out. He also drinks coffee regularly, and eats some cheese and butter. 

Q: wtf? It doesn’t sound like he’s having a “flare” but he probably shouldn’t be pooping blood. Any insight into what’s going on?

I am on Remicade, I took Asacol, and am at the point I cant administer suppositories because it's so painful. The pain is localized in the anterior area right at the anal junction. I have had s surgery (before the doctors knew I had UC) and excised an ulcerated area. However, the pain persisted and somehow spread even more to the outside.This has been going on for 3.5 years. I did multiple MRIs (5 to be specific) and scopes but nothing shows up in that area but it is the most painful thing and it has made life so debilitating and has made me depressed.

I was diagnosed with UC at 32 in 2019. I went back to school and was working as a cadet on merchant marine vessels, going for my marine engineering license. I had a terrible flare and cdiff simultaneously.  I caught cdiff when I went to the ER initially because I was having bloody movements every half hour and they told me it was probably bacterial colitis ended up in the hospital for 19 days a week later. Fuck Fort Lauderdale hospitals.  Their ERs are pretty disgusting, but this was pre covid too. Sickest Ive ever been. Had some terrible months of actual hell, because it was also right before finals, I manged to pass everything, graduate and sit for my license and pass that, even though I had to make special accommodations during the testing because I was still having frequent urgent movements. 

I manage to graduate but still am full flare, also fucked up from cdiff.  33 and have to move back in with my mom for a bit. Too sick to work, because all my skillsets are hands on, mechanic/fabricating/engineering nonsense. Not condusive when you might poop your pants. 

Luckily or unluckily Im also a partially disabled army vet, so I get a little cash from the VA.  Doctors there tell me my UC is probably related to all the crap I was exposed though. For some reason they wont put that in writing though to get my disability raised. But I get enough to where I could move out of my moms after a couple months and cover my rent, I work odd side jobs I can do at my own pace. Barely get by. Ran up credit card debt at school being a broke student and figuring i graduate get the big job pay it off no problem. Girlfriend has mental health issues and struggles more with working and making ends meet than me at the moment, im covering both of us on a lot of ends. 

Its been like this for 3 years now.  Got mostly out of the flare after about 9 months on humira.  Kept a food diary until i figured out what my body didnt like. Gone mostly all plant based. No spices. No plants from the nightshade family. Elaborate daily smoothies. Being active. Im still playing weekly soccer... the weeks im good. Ill be doing great for a couple weeks and get close to thinking i can try passing a coast guard physical, then ill just have days where my bowels/body are a mess. Like today, have had solid poops for months, talking to my union about working, then today after work, suddenly crazy urgency cant make it to the toilet and its all over the bathroom floor. No warning. No deviations in diet.  Nothing I can pin point to work on. Had a colonscopy in june everything looked perfecto up there.

How do I work? To be a marine engineer I have to be working 7 days a week for 90 days straight, then get 90 days vacation. But everything ive done has been labor intensive, thats the work ive enjoyed and now is what I am educated in and know.  I get calls people offering me 90k jobs, I cant do it, and I can barely afford groceries. My dog aka my best friend had a vet bill that cost as much as a serviceable car and wiped out my meager savings. Ive liquidated all assets except the most sentimental.

My only saving grace is I was able to snag my old job from before I went back to school, its a mom and pop operation, they understand my limitations, that some weeks i might need a unexpected day off or to just work the afternoons, they work with me and let me have flexible hours. But its barely enough to get by, much less get ahead. 

Does anyone else struggle with random extended bouts of urgency/lethargy/sleep issues even when for weeks they are feeling 100%?  I get weird soreness and joint aches, can humira do that? Im really beginning to wonder if stress is almost a bigger factor than diet a lot of times. 

If you made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read my story.  I was told to maybe reach out to some IBD communities and try that resource.

So thank you so much, I hope for nothing but solid poos for all you.",2021-10-09 09:45:50

Just wondering if anyone else out there is unfortunately dealing both with ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis? And if so, what treatments are you on?

I was diagnosed with UC in 2014 and had been managing with Lialda (mesalamine) and sometimes taking Uceris (budesonide) for the bad flareups.

Last month I was experiencing excruciating joint pain, way worse than anything I had ever had in previous flares. My GI doc suggested I get tested and go to see a rheumatologist. Initially, the rheumatologist figured it was just IBD-related joint pain, but I came back as seropositive RA. My RF was somewhat high but my anti-CCP numbers were through the roof.

The way forward looks like a biologic that is used to manage both conditions, like Humira or Remicade. I've never been on a biologic before, but from what I have heard they can work wonders.

Any feedback on UC, RA, biologics, etc. helpful and welcome.

My quality of life has severely tanked and I can't stop losing weight. I guess what I'm asking for is advice.. I am going to go see a dietitian eventually and have a follow up with my doctor to discuss adding more meds but I can't keep waiting, I get sicker by the day. Does anyone on here have this and what has helped you the most?",2021-10-12 00:05:59

I am a 25m currently dealing with a mild case of UC proctitis. I have found great relief through dietary intervention amongst many things. I managed many of my symptoms initially with a high fat high protein diet (keto) but for the last couple of months I have began reintroducing carbohydrates. During these couples months I made a point to consume the carbohydrates in isolation or accompanied with a fat source to determine how my body will react. All has been smooth sailing with noticeable improvements in my UC symptoms and over all wellbeing. However, last night for dinner I ate 200g of cooked rice with 340g of beef cooked in roughly 40g of Coconut oil. All of these volumes have been very well tolerated when separated into Carb+Fat and Protein+Fat, but for whatever reason about 4 hours after consuming the aforementioned dinner I had excruciating intestinal cramps followed by an hour of bowel clearing on the toilet. Would anyone be able to help give me some insight as to what caused this distress? My only assumption is the combination was too taxing on my digestive system?

Thanks in advance to any comments.",2021-10-11 20:13:30

256,Normal IBD symptoms?,yogafruit,9,q6xppb,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/q6xppb/normal_ibd_symptoms/,2,"Sorry in advance for the long post. I started having pain in June that onset during runs and would go away after a day or two of rest, then start up again next time I tried to run. I thought I had osteitis pubis at first because of the location on my pubic bone, but over a few weeks the pain spread to my lower abdomen and then up my abdominal wall and kept me from running or doing any core work. This evolved into bloating and distention and a sense of constipation (despite having regular, albeit smaller than usual and sometimes a little tough to pass movements). In mid-July I went to my GP with severe abdominal pain and was sent to ER. CT scan showed moderate inflammation in lower descending colon and sigmoid colon (rectal inflammation was not noted on CT scan results). ER doc prescribed antibiotics but after 7 days I was not much improved so GP prescribed 7 more days plus 5 days prednisone. At the end of the prednisone course (so \~12 days after first ER visit) another CT showed improved inflammation (now mild instead of moderate). Stool tests came back negative for bacterial, viral, parasite infections & negative for occult blood. A separate stool test showed imbalances in microbiota and, interestingly, a very low calprotectin value of 6. In August I started seeing an ND who specializes in gut issues and after a month on something called GastroMend and some targeted probiotics, I'm feeling much better but still dealing with some mild pain that flares up when I try to go for runs (easy walking seems fine). I'll note that in these past 4+ months I have had a couple of soft stools and only had diarrhea once, I noticed what maybe was a little mucous once or twice and had some undigested food when things were at the worst, and I have not had noticeable blood in my stool (by which I mean, if I took a flashlight out and really looked carefully there might be what could either be little red blood specks or little pieces of undigested fruit or vegetable skins). But mostly my stools have been normal ... I've seen a GI doc who suggested I be screened for UC and I have a colonoscopy scheduled for the end of this month. I've been reading about UC and IBD and trying to understand where my experience fits in. Most of what I read talks about blood (like, noticeable and a lot) and diarrhea (like, multiple times a day), so I am just wondering if anyone out there has symptoms or a journey similar to mine. My running season is over but still hoping to walk a 30k race I've signed up for in November so really looking forward to getting the colonoscopy done and getting whatever this thing is taken care of! Thanks for reading. 😌

261,Bit scared,ConsciousnessInc,10,q6re2q,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/q6re2q/bit_scared/,7,"Hi all,

I dropped off a stool sample a bit over a month ago as I'd had a little bit of bright red blood turn up on the toilet paper (more than the usual few specks that I had assumed was piles). I made the sample about 4 days into what seemed to be a rough stomach bug brought on by a dodgy takeaway meal and thought nothing of it.

A month later the doctor calls and says my calprotectin level was around 600, I mentioned the timing the stool sample and he suggested doing another one to be sure. I dropped off that sample yesterday and have been very anxious about this ever since he called back (last week) and told me my calprotectin level was so high.

My only symptoms (beginning with that ""stomach bug"" episode) have been stomach/abdominal discomfort and mild pain that eased off and disappeared altogether for a couple of weeks. Some of the mild discomfort has come back following a brief episode of diarrhoea  that went through the household (infecting other family members too!) and has resulted in softer, more yellow stools for the last 10 days.

Waiting on the results of the second sample, but from what I've read it seems pretty likely that I've got a colonoscopy and diagnosis of IBD in my near future.

Any advice for the meantime for dealing with the anxiety and stress?

TLDR- After years of symptoms, multiple tests, no DX. 

I wanted to post as I am still hoping for a diagnosis and wanted to vent. I finally found a PCP and GI doc that seem to be taking me seriously but it still seems like such a long road ahead. 

I am a 26 year old female.. I started having issues around 5 years ago. It started with diarrhea on a daily basis, sometimes I would be stuck in the bathroom for hours, oftentimes this would interfere with my work. This would happen several times a day. My PCP at the time mostly ignored me, but did refer me for a colonoscopy and GI consult due to my mother passing from Colon cancer. My first colonoscopy results were normal, besides several benign polyps that were removed. My GI doctor basically laughed at me for being so young and after we got my results told me I didn't need to come back and to keep taking Immodium 2-3x daily to manage my symptoms. 

I stopped trying to find answers for awhile as I was frustrated and just lived with it for a few years. Then I got my first perianial abcess. Then my second. Then one turned into a fistula. We attempted a fistula repair but unfortunately it didn't fix it completely. I also started to have other symptoms, including muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue.

My surgeon recommended that I go to a new PCP and GI doctor. My GI doctor finally did bloodwork and my CRP was slightly elevated and my platelets were slightly elevated. It's worth noting that my platelets have been elevated each time I have done my annual bloodwork. Negative for celiac.  I had a pelvic MRI for the fistula and the findings said that there was pronounced mucosal thickening at the rectum. It says this suggest proctitis that could be caused by infection or IBD. My xrays show a mild stool burden in the ace ascending and transverse colon.  My colonoscopy was clear according to my surgeon. My GI doc still thinks the elevated CRP and other inflammation is from infection, not IBD. 

I am waiting on a MRI enterography next month and I won't see my GI doctor again until December. If anyone has any suggestions for next steps or even just words of encouragement that would be appreciated.",2021-10-13 03:49:19
283,IBD support while waiting for official diagnosis,jmorgannz,16,q6z0hg,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/q6z0hg/ibd_support_while_waiting_for_official_diagnosis/,19,"Hi all,  

Long story short; I've been suffering from an unknown health condition for 3 years. It has been treated so far just as depression, chronic fatigue, and dysbiosis.  

However it is progressing and I have had a major flare up in the last two months, with dark spots in my stool, gnawing in my stomach like an ulcer, and pain in my colon 3+ hours after eating (not gas pain), as well as major food reactions either straight after food or medications are hitting my stomach, or 3 hours later around the same time I feel the colon pain.  

I also have markers trending toward anemia (RBC/HCT dropping consistently since 2018 but haven't hit the line that triggers a GP to take action yet)  

I had been taking collagen and some other vitamins but stopped when I started getting reactions to those quite strongly too.  
Now I am crippled with inflammation all the time. My colon and stomach are are inflamed and in pain. My entire abdomen has referred pain that has gone into all the muscles so that I have further abdomen and also back pain.  
I *feel* like I have an injury that is fully infammed - it's making me tearful all the time.  

I found out if I take some pectin before meals it seems to coat my stomach lining and I don't get the food reactions. This also seems to help at the colon stage; it appears the pectin coats things and prevents food from aggravating an injury.  

Still I have pain and malaise 24/7 - but at least I am clear headed instead of out of my head with food reactions all the time.  

The food reactions have been going on for 3 years. It has taken me that long to work out they are coming from the colon, as initially I had no pain.  
I only figured it out by accident by setting timers each time I eat a meal, and sure enough, 3 to 3h30m after eating I get reactions. Before I was blaming environmental triggers.  

I think what has triggered this latest downward spiral is that I stopped the supplements I was taking that, without knowing, were helping to keep my mucosa/gut lining going.  

It feels like my entire GI tract, but mostly stomach and colon, are really struggling to keep any kind of lining, and I'm certain there are ulcers not only in my stomach but in the colon.  

If I try to bend over, my entire gut just feels highly tender. My stomach area feels like I am fat, like it doesn't have room when I am bent over and is being crushed in. I thought maybe I was getting fat; but this doesn't happen when I wake up in the morning, it starts after I start eating. This tells me it's inflammation.  

My problem is that I am in the system for a colonoscopy, and have an 8 week wait time before I can get an official diagnosis.  

I had to fight to get this; my regular GP is useless and just tells me I have depression and I have a bad diet, and prescribes me anti-anxiety drugs.  I had to show him photos of blood spots in stool to get the gastro referral.  

I am really scared that this 24/7 inflammation is doing damage - I don't want to have it going on for 8 weeks whilst I wait for an official diagnosis - but I wont' take any OTC anti-inflammatory because they destroy gut lining and that is absolutely not what I need.  

It seems to get any kind of safe support medication for what I think is latent crohn's, I have to have a prescription. Anything I can get OTC will hurt me.  

What can I do in the mean time to try and reduce the pain and more importantly the damage of ongoing inflammation. I don't want scarring to start and end up with permanent damage whilst I wait.  

Any help much appreciated.  

EDIT: Oh I should say; I can't take any kind of herbal help like ginger or whatever. All of them, all teas and everything give me instant immune reactions. My immune system is so on edge that most planty/herbal things give me problems.  
My diet has thinned right down.  One practitioner put me on low carb (idiot), and I have been almost unable to get back off it again, have to stick to low fiber carbs.  

EDIT2: I hope this post is OK. I am not looking to be diagnosed. I am in the system awaiting the procedure for diagnosis, so I have seen a doc and I hope it's OK to ask about support whilst I am waiting for it. Maybe I won't have IBD, but I still need to treat things like I do and not fill up on ibuprofen or something that could make it worse if I do.",2021-10-13 02:02:36

Is there anyone who has ibd with normal calprotecin levels? 
I have had stomach issues for around 5 years I would say I’m 29 now, but have always had episodes of bloating and periods of very loose stools for a week or two. 
However the past two years or so things have gotten much much worse in 2019 I returned from a trip to Mexico with horrific stomach pain and literally couldn’t get off the toilet for two weeks I chalked this up to foreign travel and carried on with my life. around 6 months later I had horrific stomach pain and when I went to the toilet I literally filled it with blood and some clots this happened 3-4 times also around this time I also had loose stools and vomiting and was actually bed bound for 3 weeks, I visited my GP but couldn’t get an app for 3 weeks he did bloods and stool test, stool test was negative and my crp was raised at 51 or 41 I was given antacids and after a rectal examination was told the bleeding was piles. Things did calm down a little aside from what I would call ibs type symptoms and the occasional spot of blood after wiping. I did notice that I was feeling more fatigued and often feel like I’m coming down with the flu but I never actually get the flu. I started to notice I had lost weight, I get back pain and bloating constipation or very loose stools. 
Now this past few months things have gotten bad again I noticed blood on the tissue when wiping quite a bit of it and a horrific right side pain that I thought was appendix related this sharp stabbing pain my colon area lasted weeks, vomiting, shivering complete loss of appetite and again unable to get out of bed. I went to the ER 4 times I had an ultrasound that came back normal and my bloods were perfect each time. I am still suffering with loose stools and stomach pain specifically in my lower right side, the area knots and I can feel it tighten and contract if I put my hand on that area I can physically feel it. 
My gp/pcp has said ibd is unlikely due to bloods and stool test being normal. I have seen a specialist who has arranged for a colonoscopy in 6 days time. I’m honestly terrified. I’m sick of the stomach issues and fatigue and flue like feeling.

Also, this is going to be long.",TurnipSubstantial,9,q925f7,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/q925f7/should_i_seek_out_testing_outside_of_my_gi_also/,9,"First, I'll start off by saying I've lurked around for a long time but have never posted as I am chock-full of anxiety and am pretty shy so be gentle with me please :)

This is going take awhile as I unload my 30 years of frustration but I'm not sure where to go from here and would love to hear others experiences. 

So I'm loaded with issues from psychological to physical. All of which, I'm sure impact each other. I obviously have a multitude of GI pains but the very first memory I have of one is when I was around 10-12. I remember writhing in pain on my bed. It felt like the worst muscle cramp of my life right in the middle of my abdomen that went up my shoulder and to my back. The contractions started slow and dull and as it picked up in speed it grew in intensity with brief periods of relief between each one. I recall my mom taking me to the emergency room after it wouldn't let up. They asked me what I ate that day and I told them pizza. They said I probably had a piece of pizza crust lodged in a sphincter. Ok. So I get older and go through plenty of reflux and gastritis. At 16 I got my gallbladder removed. I can't remember specifically what was wrong because my chart doesn't go back that far. The hospital in my shitty little town switched systems a few years back so records are only available electronically from like 2011 on. I'm sure I could get my hands on them if I really tried. Anyway, removing my gallbladder changed nothing if not exacerbated my symptoms. I had a few endoscopies with nothing but gastritis found. At one point they thought it maybe Spincter of Oddi Dysfuntion so they did an ERCP but all was normal. For the next few years it was (and still is) chronic diarrhea the moment food hits my lips and multiple times a day. And if it's not that I am immediately constipated. Over the years I've had that same ""middle of the stomach"" attack a handful of times. I realized codeine was one of the triggers for these attacks because shocker, I always had respiratory issues growing up as well and every time I'd take prescription cough meds with codeine I'd have a terrible attack. I've had it a few other times besides that. One night it was wine, one time it was a stomach bug my whole family had, I can't always put my finger on a trigger but I know once I feel that small dull ache it's game over and I feel like I'm dying. 

The other pain is much more common for me(along with the usual like nausea, hemorrhoid's -internal and external, you know the drill...) I have it every single day but it varies severity. This pain feels like a knife right in my right side and when it flares it feels like textbook appendicitis. Hurts to move, sit, cough, touch, ect... This is always hanging around but when I flare it gets SO intense. Straight razor blades in my intestines. Lasts a couple days and slowly goes down. Then it feels like my whole lower abdomen is searing hot. 

When my brother passed away at a young age in January of 2019 it all came to a head. Obviously stress is a big trigger for me. My whole body freaked out. Fatigue, light sensitivity, symmetrical polyarthritis, multiple joint pain, dizziness/lightheadedness, cold intolerance, all the stomach pains, and palpitations. Just over all felt like a bag of shit. So my doc runs every test she can think of on me and sent me to an infectious disease doc.

Celiac, b12, vitamin D, c diff, RF, ANA, hepatitis, campylobacter, shiga toxin panel, sed rate, blood tests, stool culture, ova and parasite. All normal. Lyme disease was negative but had 3 reactive IGG bands. Calprotectin was just within borderline at 85.4 mcg/g. Lactoferrin was positive. At one time my creatinine was slightly low.

-I know you're probably tired of reading this, I don't blame you. As am I.

In the meantime I was in the ER with another flare. CT with contrast shows:

""Liver again demonstrates mild intrahepatic ductal dilation. No dilation of the common bile duct as on prior""

""There are again inguinal nodes up to 10mm. There again are a few prominent mesenteric nodes.""

""There is an element of hypervascularity about the adnexa slightly greater on the left and I favor an element of pelvic congestion syndrome""

""There are areas of colonic wall thickening. This is particularly about the cecum and ascending colon.. Element of fecal retention but another consideration would be a colitis in this respect"".  

None of this is really acknowledged or talked about with my PCP and I get referred to a GI at a bit larger hospital about an hour and a half away from my town.

Right before I was scheduled for my colonoscopy I was back in the ER with another flare. This time there is no ductal dilation. There is ""fluid-filled small bowel loops diffusely without evidence of bowel edema or obstruction. The left colon shows mild edema without evidence of obstruction. Cannot exclude mild enteritis and early colitis.""

""Appendix has 9mm diameter and is fluid-filled. Small calcification on the tip of the appendix. Cannot exclude early acute appendicitis"" -This is where I get annoyed. I've ALWAYS said these flares feel exactly like appendicitis. So I felt validated, like this motherfucker is irritated and it at least shows something on there!- Wrong, it was a snowstorm and my WBC was only a little elevated so they said ehh, lets wait to check her WBC again tomorrow then we'll decide. And I knew exactly what was going to happen..... I was there at peak flare, it would start to calm down now and by morning, wouldn't you know it. My WBC was within normal range and nothing was done. Super awesome.

Now its time for my first colonoscopy (if you're still reading this, thank you and I love you). So we've got

 ""Rectum: there was mild diffuse erythema, biopsies were done. Small non-bleeding hemorrhoids, identified on retroflexion. Ileocecal valve: there was diffusema and small punctate ulcerations in the T1. Impression: Terminal ileitis"". Everything else was normal. Now the pathology. "" Small bowel: Focal ileitis. Rectum: minimal active proctitis with hyperplastic changes. Comments: Sections showed benign small bowel mucosa with focal active inflammation and minimal chronic cryptic architectural changes. No granuloma is identified. Sections from section C show minimal active inflammation in the background of hyperplastic changes"" 

So there's that. She gives the directions of watching me unless I have chronic diarrhea or rectal bleeding which Hiiiii, been here the whole time. Says if I have those then to come back and start meds for IBD. Now enters anxiety. I hate driving and I was uninformed and terrified of the drugs used to treat this so uhh I did nothing. Just modified my diet and cut back alcohol intake. I did ask her receptionist what the doctor made of my appendix issue on that last CT and she said no worries talk to your PCP. Gotcha. PCP refers me to surgeon. He says reoccurring appendicitis is suuuuuper rare and wants me to track my period because he's thinking possibly endo. I have wild periods. Quite often 2 a month. 

So life happens, had a huge insurance hiccup so I pump the breaks on figuring things out and I go on dealing with the usual until a few weeks ago (now insured again). Started getting really bad reflux which hasn't been too much of an issue that last few years. Couldn't eat anything. But I'm also stubborn and don't take any medications for things until I absolutely have to. So having reflux and my dizziness upon standing is getting bad. Like every time I stand up I feel like I'm going to black out. And my urgency to urinate issues (which have always been a bit of a problem-I'm sure my pelvic floor is trash) gets way worse but I also have a terrible time starting to urinate. I think damn, maybe somethings inflamed and pushing on that area. And I'm deeeead tired. More than the usual fatigue. I'm used to being nauseous, that's no big deal. But this time I puke. I don't eat until early afternoon usually because ya know, I poop immediately and I've got stuff to do. So when I puke its nothing but bile and coffee grounds. I think fuck, I really can't ignore this now (my brother had internal bleeding when he died so naturally I'm a little worried about this). I go to the doctor that day, she puts me on Omeprazole and schedules me a endoscopy and colonoscopy. Had the procedure yesterday (with the same GI I had all the endoscopies with when I was younger) and would you look at that. She's clean as a fucking whistle. No inflammation, no ulcers, nothing. Now I'm super relieved. Your mind races about what could be going on in there during these flares but I'm so glad it's not something bad. So they slap some ""IBS"" on me and I'm out the door. Still waiting on pathology and they're checking for h. pylori. I just want to know what in the fuck is wrong with my system. I've experimented with diet. I live a generally healthy lifestyle these days. I just need deeper answers. I wish there was a bio-private detective or something....

So my question is, do I seek out other options? Is GI mapping worth it? Do I find someone to do a SIBO test? Is there other tests I should be asking about? I tried Viome a few years back and it was okay but not super helpful. Anything else I can do to dig a little deeper? I don't know, I'm just kind of stuck right now and I'm exhausted. I know I am so lucky because so many people are dealing with a fuck lot worse and would kill to have my little problems and power to all of you. You are true fucking champs. I feel a bit like a baby whining about my issues but I am also paranoid as shit and am unsure of what else to do so any insight at all is so welcome.

Once again, THANK YOU if you made it through this. I offer you a piece of my anxiety filled little shit heart. Much love. 

tl;dr: Lifetime of symptoms. Fucked up scans, normal scans. I don't know what's wrong with me. Is it worth it to pay someone other than my GI or PCP to do any other testings? And if so, what tests should I be looking for? Thanks guyssss.

I’ve (25yr f) been diagnosed with microscopic lymphocytic colitis about almost a year ago, had lost almost 20 lbs(am pretty small regardless so this was very unhealthy) when I had my first flare up which lasted about 4 months. I was taking melatonin gummies a lot to help me sleep because I was going through a lot of depression and feeling worse about myself for being so sick. I noticed that when I didn’t take the melatonin, I wouldn’t wake up and be on the toilet for hours, so I stopped and for the most part I haven’t had any bad flare ups. I also had a few other big changes in my life as well(got out of a toxic relationship, moved away from hometown, am feeling generally happier, some dietary changes) so I never really was able to figure out what made my flare up go away, but I decided to stay away from the melatonin just in case. I just started taking magnesium gummies to help with anxiety and had a flare up this morning, it could possibly be from stress, but I’m curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar to me with gummies or maybe melatonin with their IBD issues? I’m stopping taking everything now bc I don’t want another flare up to last 4 months when I just finally started getting back to a regular routine.

I mean one of my earliest memories is going to the hospital with my mum about it and having movicol for the first time. Yuck.

Last year it got worse. I stopped our long weekend break in Cornwall (in a covid lockdown break) as I couldn't get up from a public toilet for 4 hours. In the middle of absolutely no where. 
Since then I have had mucus in my stools and pretty much no break from abdo pain.
I was admitted to hospital in November of last year where they suspected appendicitis and removed it to realise that my appendix was only ""aged"" and had no idea why I was in pain.
After that I have been in A&E twice and in which I have had morphine where that hadn't even gotten rid of my pain.

The doctors have now told me to stop with the cocodomol and have put me on fibrogel. 
I'm not sure how that is going to help Since I have been pooping between 2-8 times a day. 

I have tried prebiotics,  mint capsules,  omaprazole, movicol, fructulose and the other antispasmodic tablets and nothing. I've tried cutting out caffeine, milk, bread, veg. 

Today the doctors have decided to put me on mebevrine and have called off any further investigation as my last cal protein was normal (33)and the one before has not been logged in my history but says normal, before this it was very high at( 620).

It feels like they have given up and just thrown ibs and fodmap at me to keep me away.

I have broken down today after the phone call. After over 9 months of waiting for a referral and having to go through the whole process again after moving they have decided not to go ahead with any further investigation.

My parter says to get a second opinion with him present but I honestly don't know what to do and feel extremely let down.

My doctor had me take budesonide ER 9mg for 3 months. It made my diarrhea go away, and I went down from 4-7 trips to the restroom to 1-3 per day. After 3 months I started getting muscle pain and asked to start tapering off (doctor intended to keep me on for 4 months).

After dropping down to 6mg, the diarrhea came back, but I was only going 2-3 times a day still. The doctor was concerned about the diarrhea and told me to go back up to 9mg, so I did. After only a week severe muscle pains came back and the diarrhea didn't get better, so I went back down to 6mg again. Since going back to 6mg, my diarrhea has gone back to like 3-5 times per day, and I'm getting dehydrated/lightheaded easily again. 

I emailed my doctor and they told me to just stop taking the budesonide ER.

Do you guys have any suggestions/recommendations regarding tapering off vs just stopped like my doctor said? I read that you're supposed to taper. 

Also, do you have any tests/medicines you recommend asking my doctor about? I've tried enzymes, xifaxan, and the budesonide ER so far. I would prefer to not be on a long term medication with potential life changing side effects, like the steroids.",2021-10-21 00:27:55

I have not been diagnosed with IBD. I have been diagnosed with IBS. and in no way am I saying it's as bad for me as I know how much IBD sufferers struggle <3 

The reason I am actually here posting is because I am a bit confused regarding my diagnosis and would love to hear your experiences so I can adjust my expectations/understand if I'm missing the mark here. . I'll bullet to make it easier to read

My symptoms:
- mucus in stools
- 5 stone weight loss unintentional in 1 year
- constant fatigue
-lower left pain when digesting
-severe stomach cramps
- during a flare up I have diarrhea between 6-7 times in a day
- I only have about one normal bowel movement a month and it's still on the side of constipation or diarrhea.
-stomach feels super sore inside to touch
-always bloated and gassy
-i get ulcers in my mouth and along my tongue constantly
- I've tried low fodmap diets, vegan, gluten free, there is no pattern between food and flare up, or stress and flare up, it happens whenever it wants to seemingly! 
-joint pain every day
-occular migraines and eye soreness

I feel as if these shouldnt be ignored... For the below reasons

- I've read that normal blood tests and stool sample can happen with an IBD patient. My tests came back normal, but I was diagnoses with IBS straight away with no further tests. Is this the correct way or should I atleast be considered to see a GI for food allergies or even for managing the symptoms of IBS. My doctor has prescribed me with anti depressants as my treatment even though I have told him I am not depressed. I feel a bit shoe horned and would have liked to be sure it isn't IBD. 

- I've also heard others say that they were thoroughly tested before bein diagnosed with IBS because IBS means there is no other identifiable cause. But I don't feel my doctor has explored enough to check the causes

Can anyone shed some light for me on their experience and journey with being diagnosed and how they navigated the health system to help themselves the most effective way

Thanks so much in advance !",2021-10-20 20:15:35

I also had a mri done but the readiology didn’t send both my tests I took which was one of the pelvis and abdomen. So the doctor only went over the pelvis one. She said I was from there. After I asked for a copy in the front they really did only give me the pelvis one. I was freaking out because I wanted to see if my stomach and digestive tracts were ok. Well I had other things to do so I had to leave with a copy of my results. I notice they checked every organ of my body but never mention anything about my digestive tract or small intestine. So I am disappointed to know if the lab order wasn’t for my small intestine.mri are not easily approved by insurance this took so much to get. Also my medication isn’t cover for sibo and I am overall distraught. I don’t know what to do.,2021-10-20 18:59:40

I had a stomach bug way back in July and ever since it’s been a slow but gradual increase in symptoms. (What’s strange is that I have done multiple CBC panels throughout this time and my monocytes and lymphocytes would be normal.. and still are.. so it’s not bacterial or viral?? Doctors would tell me it’s not an infection at least?) So far it’s pretty much the typical symptoms, so I won’t go into detail- it’s just what scares me the most is the blood. It’s blood with every bowel movement for 2 months straight. I’m trying to figure out what is causing this colitis if it’s not bacterial? And not chronic disease? Or is it, have you all been through this? I’m so confused. 

So I finally got a GI doc, did endo and colonoscopy. 

Findings were this: 

Endoscopy: 
Biopsy: Duodenal mucosa with focally increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (preserved villi) 

Findings: 
Rule out celiac- did blood work is not celiac. 

Colonoscopy: 
Verbally told me it was inflamed on the left side. 

Biopsy showed: 

Active chronic colitis, colonic mucosa shows architectural crypt distortion and regenerative epithelial changes with goblet cell depletion. A lamina propria inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and eosinophils is noted. No dysplasia. 

I have history of high antibiotic use, and this stomach bug happened in the middle of me taking amoxicillin for strep. Wouldn’t he have seen c diff in the colonoscopy? That’s what confuses me. So I think there’s no way it can be c diff induced colitis so?? 

I’m asking for guidance as far as direction for testing, and if this has happened to anyone. I’m so confused because bloodwork is fine - no sign of infection or chronic disease (at least it seems that way) and I have no other known food allergies (I cut out dairy and gluten as it is since I’m sensitive) So why random colitis? How can I better navigate finding an answer? What should I bring up to doctor to help? 

I’m going to make an appointment when GI office is open. So in the meantime I just need to talk to others because it’s been stressing me out. (Also I just got these results back today, which is why I’m just now thinking of making appt)

(Reduction in pain, reduced inflammation (ex. CRP), increased healing ability, increased time spent in remission, etc.)

These benefits have been verified by **multiple** clinical trials specifically for Crohn's and U.C. (not necessarily general IBS / IBD without the endoscopic Crohn's / U.C. ""markers"").

I made a video explaining the results of this combination of research. It may be able to help many of you here. I also go over how to take melatonin properly. You don't take melatonin for Crohn's / U.C. the same way you take it for sleep.

I have no name for the “dis-ease”, but know that it is much more visible and confronting to observe than the hidden autoimmune that it is attempting to bring under control. Within days of starting the medication, my brain ebbs and flows between moments of what I call “buzz”; where doing something slightly energetic will give you more and more energy until your heart is racing, thoughts are darting wildly between things and (for me) tremors take over my head, neck and arms, and extreme fatigue, where exhaustion from the aforementioned side effects have taken it out of you, and the only way to recover is to do absolutely nothing. Not something I am very content with doing. 

Prednisolone is effective. There is no denying that the drug does what it is supposed to (in my times of needing it). Yet it can be so hard to focus and remind yourself why you are on it in the first place. Focus. I can both be so intensively focussed on a task that I will not stop until it is completed (…bathroom handles are looking sparkly clean), or I can have such a short attention span that I need to walk away mid-sentence. Does this paragraph itself not just highlight my point.  

I stare. I run my tongue across my teeth to check they are still there. I shake. I chew on carrot to make sure my teeth aren’t falling out. I sleep. I brush my teeth because they start to feel strange. I’m paranoid about breaking bones. How long does it take for them to become brittle? Is this why I am worried about my bloody teeth!? As I type this the sense of alone-ness creeps in. Surely no one else gets as paranoid about their teeth or has such fleeting random thoughts as I do. 

But they do. And I know this because every time I start on Prednisolone I google the questions. Every. Time. I know I already know the answers. I think I search to know that I’m not alone…

-	How to stop weight gain on prednisolone?
-	Tremors on prednisolone normal?
-	Side effects of prednisolone?
-	Will my teeth fall out on prednisolone?
-	How to explain prednisolone to loved ones?

And every time I find solace in knowing that I most certainly am not alone. The side effects, the disease it is treating, the dosage and duration may all be different, but there is a sense of camaraderie and together-ness when looking at the posts, queries, questions and blogs so many others have written about this small little pill. We grin and bear it or grit our teeth (gently, gently), trust that it is all for a good reason and that we will eventually draw our sense of self back out into the drivers seat. 

I write this on a new course of prednisolone. The beginning of my longest course yet, to settle disease symptoms that in retrospect did not seem so severe to have to put up with the pred effect. The way this piece is written, jumping from one thing to another, is the truest reflection of how I am feeling. Ebb and flow by the moon…face.",2021-10-26 07:05:51

I’m wondering if there is any income assistance programs in Canada that could help with covering costs of my medications. For reference, I have one prescription now (unrelated to IBD) that is $30 and my parents insurance will cover all but $5 of it. If my medications are in the hundreds, I’ll end up having to pay quite a bit out of pocket which is something i cannot afford, and my parents are not able to assist me financially.

From everything I have told you do you think that the suspected IBD diagnosis could be correct? Are my symptoms inline with this condition?

I was curious as to whether anyone has experienced hair-loss from IBS?

Back story: I started having bowel issues around 2 years ago after some NSAID use. I noticed that when I hadn’t eaten in a few hours, I would experience chronic stomach pain. Shortly after, I noticed that my hair was falling out in CLUMPS. It’s been close to 2 years and I’m still experiencing chronic hair shedding.

I recently had my blood examined which showed no abnormalities such as deficiencies, yet I’m still experiencing chronic hair fall.

I haven’t had my bowel issues diagnosed although it is not as chronic as it once was.

Is it worth examining my gut health despite showing no deficiencies?

I really need some feedback on this. My hair fall is causing me to experience chronic episodes of depression, even breaking down in tears at certain points throughout my day.

I had a follow-up this morning with my GI doc.  I am currently in the middle of the diagnostic process and just feel so drained by it. I was feeling great both physically and emotionally until today. I have some form of indeterminate IBD, but have very fortunately been asymptomatic and feeling well on medication for a few months. However, I am super anxious right now after my follow-up, and nervous about what is to come with my process and this condition. 

My history...

*Doctors still not sure if I have Ulcerative Colitis or Chron's. My primary symptom is blood on stool. During my worst flare, I was having frequent bloody BMs (solid, no diarrhea), actual splotches of blood when wiping, and mucus (sometimes passing only a pinky coloured bloody mucus). Symptoms improved a lot shortly before my first colonoscopy, but was still having mild bleeding; the other symptoms stopped at that point in time though. Was not on medication yet and had no actual diagnostic information as to what was causing my symptoms (IBD was suspected of course).


*1st colonoscopy in June 2021 showed mild inflammation in rectum and cecum - biopsy proven.  Biopsies not taken from terminal ileum. Blood tests and calprotectin tests were all normal (normal CRP, calprotectin was like 10 or something in that neighbourhood). Started Pentasa 500mg 4 times a day AFTER all of these tests were done and analyzed by my doctor. Could not determine between Chron's and Colitis due to insufficient biopsies taken. Blood stopped within days of starting Pentasa and did not return. 


*2nd colonoscopy to see how things were doing in Oct 2021 showed ""no chronic active inflammation"", including in the terminal ileum this time. Only finding was ""mild architectural distortion"" in the colon. Bleeding started up in small amounts following the scope and stopped again within a week or so. GI doc felt this was likely due to many biopsies having been taken. Felt so relieved to see the results this time, and assumed that things were on the right track and that this could be taken as good news. 


*Had my formal follow-up appointment today with GI doc to discuss colonoscopy findings. Doc feels my case is unusual and is referring me for a CT scan next. Stated that we cannot rule out Chron's disease and if the CT shows Chron's I will likely need to change medications.  I was sad to hear this because I really like the Pentasa and haven't had side effects at all from it. Says it is possible that I have achieved remission, but they are still not able to provide certainty with that or with my overall diagnosis. She was patient, kind, and answered all my questions, but I am feeling like I've taken a step backward and am nervous based on this conversation.

I had recently some tests done and my urine and bloodwork seem rather normal, except lower glucose in the morning.

I also had three tests for occult blood (all negative) and one for calprotectin (11,80 ug/g), which is apparently very normal.

I go 2-4 times a day, usually some form to it, completely solid maybe 70% of the time and haven’t bled since June. I go to work, drive 1 hour there and back no issue. I have energy, can gain weight and yet the second I had a loose movement I would become convinced I was getting bad again. That stress would make it worse in a viscous cycle. You can “feel” if it’s a good or bad poop and I feel happier not examining it. It’s easy to forget that healthy people don’t drop solid logs every time. I realised it’s important to look at the bigger picture. I’m just posting this in the Hope others can relate. Stay strong and may the poop gods smile on you.",2021-11-15 17:31:52

My question is, is ferrous sulfate safe to take with IBD. When I read online it says that it is not great for people with IBD. My family Dr prescribed it but said it 8s going to upset my Bowel/stomach quite a bit and that I only take it Mon, Wed, Fri but I take double the dose.

So it's painful but I'm not suppossed to be doubling over from pain.

He gave me antibiotics,  budenofalk, salofalk, braxidin (which surprised me, if I have ibs why he gave me ibd drugs?)

and refer me to a hypnotherapist psychologist for that pain that suppossed to be  not all that bad.

My husband are upset and force me to come to this famous Gastro doc in IG (i'm a bit wary of IG famous doctors) especially his content is all about GERD.

After seeing that doctor without insurance than he declared I have IBD afterall since 2016 and all of doctors that are more senior than him missed the mark and prescribed me Humira that he claims can get me into remission in 5 months!

New to the sub, so apologies if I made any mistakes! I also have seen a doctor before if that's relevant. Not asking for a diagnosis at all, have been diagnosed already with regular colitis just waiting on the colonoscopy and biopsy for ulcerative colitis.

I've been having bad digestive issues since June. I moved across the country for grad school in August, however, and because of that I had to switch doctors and I have my new IBD appointment finally the first week of December. My previous doctor before moving was bad and while he did some tests, he wouldn't even do a colonoscopy, for context.

Anyways, I've lost 50 pounds at least since June with no excersise. I also started ADHD medication in May, and with moving and the medication my lifestyle changed alot. I went from being completely sedentary and using junk food and snacks for dopamine to now not eating any snacks and walking a little bit (just 10 minutes each way to and from class, the grocery store, around campus, etc.).

I have alot of other symptoms of IBD (along with being diagnosed with GERD already). However, I'm unsure at what point does my weight loss become dangerous to the point I need to go like see a doctor asap. I'm also concerned that when I tell the IBD doctor that the weight loss will be like, inflated and look worse than it is because of the lifestyle changes too, or even worse they'll blame the ADHD meds for all my symptoms (very much not the case, I've had digestive issues my whole life, June is just when the rapid weight loss and severe symptoms started).

I'm a bit concerned though since I've gotten to losing like a pound every two days. It's been 4 pounds since last week, even though I haven't had any physical activity like at all (Zoom class for the last 2 weeks). And I've started dry heaving and like, cramping? But I'm hoping I can just wait to my appointment.

Basically, I'd appreciate any insight or advice! I've tried to look online but I'm unsure at what point my symptoms become like emergent if that makes sense?",2021-11-22 20:19:20

I had a bad 'flare' a few months after my kid was born last year in which I had constant diarrhea, urgency, pain, frequently, passing blood and mucus only
I then started taking immodium and not eating much food so I could leave the house and stuff and the diarrhea calmed down a lot, though the mucus and pain etc didn't go away
Then a couple months ago I had a suspected partial bowel obstruction, had all the symptoms but didn't go to a&e when advised, just waited it out for two weeks, didn't leave the house at all as I was in too much pain, and it passed by itself
I'm still in pain everyday, currently somewhat constipated, passing some orange mucus, but my crp and calprotectin are fine so my doctor doesn't care and I do have periods with minimal symptoms like right now so that's why I'm posting

Basically, can you have ibd and go periods of time without symptoms even without medication, and if so how do I advocate for myself at the doctors so they'll consider running more tests because I know I can have ibd without raised calprotectin, but my doctor just isn't interested

However two weeks ago I started seeing a little blood in the bowl with normal stools. Then, one morning just over a week ago I woke up with a bad stomach ache and urgency to go to the toilet. Since then I’ve had stomach cramps, been passing mostly mucous and blood, and have been going some days up to 10 times per day. Most of the times I go to the toilet it’s just what seems like intense gaseous farts and then all that comes out is mucous accompanied with blood (but not always). 

My actual stool formation through all this has varied but a lot of the time they’ve been formed and appeared quite normal - so the stools themselves for the most part haven’t been diarrhoea… it’s these wet mucous / blood farts I do. They are accompanied with intense urgency to go and some stomach pain. I’ve had a bit of fatigue around all this but still have managed to work, go to the gym and run somehow. 

This has been going on for 9 days now, though it doesn’t seem to be getting worse, it seems to be slowly becoming more infrequent. Like right now I’ve just eaten dinner a few hours ago and my stomach feels fine. Before that I had some cramping which lasted 30 minutes or so - some days I feel no cramping. 

I’ve called my doctor and we have a pending test for pathogens - I am honestly hoping it is a gut bug or similar, because I’m so worried now, but the fact that this has been going on for 9 days makes me extremely doubtful. The way it came on was so strange as I just woke up one day and experienced all these things I’ve never experienced before. 

I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy about 2.5 years ago and everything was good back then. Could this simply be pathogens or does it sound like I’ve got something more going on here? I don’t even know if pathogens can cause this.",2021-11-26 15:07:37

I am a 22 year old female. Over the past few years I would have occasional diarrhea and stomach cramps. However this summer it’s gotten extremely extremely worse. 

It started off this summer with the an extreme sudden urge to go to the bathroom. If I wasn’t able to get to the bathroom that second I would have extreme cramping. It was always diarrhea. If the pain was bad enough I would also throw up. So this happened on and off for a few months until it got worse. Most of these episodes occurred after dinner or in the early AM (like between 1-3 am)

About 10 days ago I had a really bad episode and haven’t been able to stomach food since. No matter what I eat I have constant diarrhea, feel extremely bloated and have really bad cramps. This has now been ongoing. I have basically put my life on hold. I can’t leave the house nor go in the car. I feel best in the morning after not eating all night. 

As of today I am going to try cutting out gluten to see if this makes a difference. 

Is the sudden urge to use the bathroom a sign of IBD? Do these symptoms sound similar to anyone else?

For over two months I had increasingly worse symptoms of stomach cramps, extreme urgency to use toilet, pooping 3-6 times a day, a lot of blood in poop. After several doctors visits (one didn’t even exam me and tried to tell me it was my period) I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy done as well as a stool sample. Endoscopy came back normal, colonoscopy found inflammation in the colon, particularly in the left flexor, the report said they had to switch to pediatric camera as any contact to the colon caused immediate bleeding, calprotectin levels in the stool sample were 1369 which seems very high. The doctor said it was infectious colitis and but there was no bacteria present. He prescribed probiotics and told me to eat no fat and low sugar. My symptoms were milder after the colonoscopy but have continued somewhat. There is less blood but still blood present, don’t feel like I’m going to crap my pants multiple times a day but still need the toilet at least three times a day. Stress makes it worse. They didn’t rule out celiac disease but I don’t think this is the cause. I’ve been on ten courses of antibiotics this year which may be the reason for all the stomach issues. My question is what is infectious colitis? It wasn’t explained to me in the hospital and when I google it I only get results for ulcerative colitis or acute colitis caused by food poisoning or a bacteria that clears quickly, not something that continues for months. And also how do they know it’s not an ibd when there was inflammation present? 
I got all the treatments done at a private hospital as my boss has a lot of connections and brought me there but I can’t get follow up care there as it is in a different country (I’m in Europe) and I can’t afford it. Also everything was done in German which I don’t speak. I had to translate the results to find out what was going on. I’m very grateful my boss helped me as my referral to a public hospital wasn’t until next year but I’m very confused by the results. 
If anyone has any information on infectious colitis that lasts for months I would be so, so grateful. I hope I’ve posted this to the right place. Thank you :)

First time I experienced this was several years ago while tapering cortisone. This happened when I was walking up stairs or squatting down to pick something up. Then it happened again when I was in remision and started lifting weights. My legs started to hurt while doing squats (with barbell), it feels like the kind of muscle soreness you usually get the day after training. The pain decreased both in intensity and affected area as I kept training but unfortunately the remision was short and I was forced to start taking cortisone again a couple of weeks later.

Now several years later I am once again functional and have recently started to lift weights again. I have once again encountered the same problem when squatting. The pain have decreased since I started but it is persistent and have not vanished yet. I wonder if anyone have experienced something similar and know what it is or have some sort of advice.

**About the Virtual Support Group:**

The Virtual Support Group is sponsored by the [Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, Upstate Northeastern New York Chapter](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/chapters/upstateny), and is open to all Crohn's & Colitis patients and their caregivers, regardless of your location, age, disease severity, etc. The only requirement is the willingness to foster a caring, supportive community of people who share similar challenges as result of IBD.

The group was started in November 2020 as a way to connect IBD patients with each other for the purpose of sharing our experiences, advice, and supporting each other in a welcoming, safe, and judgment free environment. Participants may join via video and audio or leave their video off if they wish. You can even just listen in or use the chat if you don't feel like talking.

Our discussions are free-flowing and anyone may participate as much or as little as they like. We will discuss whatever is on people's minds related to dealing with IBD including medications, doctors, physical, mental, and emotional struggles, issues with work, school, friends or family, etc.",2021-12-02 04:14:03

574,Quality of life conversation,DevilsChurn,7,r7p8ay,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/r7p8ay/quality_of_life_conversation/,6,"tl;dr - have you, in any of your conversations with your GI, addressed the advisability of particular treatments and/or diagnostic procedures in light of quality of life issues?  In other words, why go through something if it's not about finding out what will help?

\---------------------------

Back in April, after 17 years of symptoms, lack of access to medical care and - thanks to my Y-chromosome deficiency, I suspect - being consigned to the psychiatric ghetto and being told that it was all in my head, I finally got the diagnostic workup I needed; and I now know that I have microscopic colitis.

I've also had GERD for several decades, that dates from an episode when - in my 20s, when I was healthy and active - I actually *felt* a belch forcing my stomach into my diaphragm, and the pain involved with it stretching/tearing in the process (I sang opera professionally - I know where my diaphragm is).  Since that time I have experienced nightly reflux - and it has not been a respecter of BMI, diet, lifestyle interventions or anything else that has been recommended to me over the years.

When I finally got a GI referral in June of this year, I had already been on budesonide for the colitis for two months.  I ended up on it for seven months, including the taper.   Even before the taper began I was already experiencing a deterioration of function (that never really improved that much, aside from a decrease in pain scores, and partial relief from the multiple nighttime stools).  It's only been a few weeks since the DC, and already I've noted a marked increase of symptoms.

As for the GERD, I had a barium swallow yesterday to evaluate for a hiatal hernia, with the view to a repair if the test came out positive.  The report only indicated a slight oesophageal stricture, probably due to chronic inflammation.  I already had an EGD done five years ago that showed no Barrett's oesophagus.  I've never smoked, and have no familial cancer history, so I'm not concerned about this.

My GI seems barely interested in ""managing"" the lower GI symptoms, and wants me to come in for another EGD to essentially ""keep an eye on it"" - not in the service of any potential therapeutic intervention.  That is not what I want.

The GERD sufficiently compromised my vocal function that I had to give up singing as a profession.  I then retrained for another career, only to have the bowel issues scupper that one as well.  Thanks to years of lack of access to medical care - and then another several years lost thanks to not being listened to - my GI problems have progressed past the point where early intervention might have significantly helped (if not completely resolved) them.

These problems have ruined me professionally and economically to the point where I nearly ended up on the streets a few years ago.  I was forced to go on disability, which doesn't provide me the funds I would need to upgrade my skills to a point where I could get the kind of remote position I would need with my compromised bowel function:  one that might allow me to crawl out of the miserable economic situation I find myself in.

I'm constantly exhausted - and not only miss being financially solvent, but also the healthy, active lifestyle I used to maintain, especially when I sang professionally (my body was my ""instrument"", after all).  I have no family, I lost nearly all of the friends I had before I became poor, and have no real support system.  I'm used to looking after myself; but I no longer have the resources, nor the energy, to engage in anything that brings pleasure or meaning to my life.

I went into this therapeutic relationship hoping that I could find an improvement in my quality of life - and, especially, a solution to the reflux that would allow me to be able to do my music again, even if just for my own pleasure.  

Instead, I'm given no hope of improvement and - to be frank - a lackadaisical approach to any therapeutic process.  I'm being pressured to undergo another EGD - which, because of my circumstances, would cost me a significant amount of money for transport and lodging in a town hours away from where I live - for no other reason than to line the pockets of the docs, under the pretext of ""keeping an eye on"" a minor diagnostic finding.

As far as I'm concerned, I'm not interested in whether the inflammatory findings might eventually metamorphose into a malignant process.  At this point, if that were to happen, I wouldn't bother to undergo treatment anyway, as I don't consider my quality of life to be worth extending it.

I'm not saying this to be dramatic, and I'm in no way depressed or suicidal.  I've thought about this for a long time, and feel very clear-eyed about it.  If the doctors I'm seeing can't improve my quality of life, what's the point?

Have any of you had this kind of conversation with your practitioners - and, if so, what sort of feedback did you get?",2021-12-03 04:29:08

I am 33M, always healthy, perfect BMI, until my life suddenly change one day after 1 lunch which resulted with pain in abdomen, diarrhea, and blood.  


Since I am anxious in general, in 48h I ended up doing all blood test, stool test, colonoscopy and biopsy which diagnosed: Colitis Chronica Non-Specific + Enteritis Chronica on Ileum, without any pathomorpohological changes that could show IBD.  


48 after my first bloody stool, blood stopped, and stool returned to normal by itself, but had another 7 days of stomatch growl and abdominal pain (possible due to colonoscopy, irritation, and IBS since I was scared as hell).  


Since then I am 3 months on Mesalamine (2x 1gram per day). Stool is normal, no blood, but let's say on each 7-8 days, I have 1 day that I have a lot of stomatch sound, and light abdominal pain. (I am trying to belive that this is because of IBS due to my anxiety and fear of IBD)  


Is there anything else I could to to prevent my non-specific colitis going into IBD beside good diet, and Mesalamine? Are there any preventive meassures like biotherapy, whipworm therapy, oxygen therapy (found these by googling).  


In case I cannot prevent it, how progressive and aggresive is IBD, is it good sign because I have light symptoms from start?  


Second problem is my anxiety, I am sports person, travelere, but since I was reading about this, for 3 months every moment of my day I think and google about IBD. I am affraid that I will not be able to leave home or travel one day due to symtoms that might occur, surgeries, stoma, etc.. How do you deal with this?

Hi friends! I  need some hopeful words! All my tests I found out have been both toxin AND PCR. Cross Posting in Cdiff Sub.

**From late 2019-September this year I had painful, bloody diarrhea 15-20x/day. My GI doctor kept giving me immodium, viberzi, lomotil.** 

I went to a new GI doctor in September.

**09/30** my Cdiff Toxin test via Quest came back positive for Cdiff. I began vanc for 14 days.

I felt immediate relief from the vanc. I finished 10/13. I was tested the same day and tested negative for Cdiff Toxins. I was great for about a week. 

**10/22** symptoms began again. 10/26 I was retested and **10/27** the results came back positive. I worried that the brand of suppositories I was using caused the reinfection so I stopped using them.

**10/28** I started Difficid. 

**11/9/2021** I retested for Cdiff and I tested negative. I started taking align probiotics, florastor, and IB guard. I used the disinfecting detergent from Lysol. I bleached everything. I made my own 1:9 bleach solution and bleached my phone, surfaces, etc.

**11/20** I went to an event at the home of a family friend who tested positive for Cdiff **11/16**. She was on vanc at the time. I didn’t find out about her cdiff until after the event (I would definitely not have attended if I had known beforehand).

During **11/9-11/28** I felt great. No pepto required, no immodium. No diarrhea for the first time in YEARS.

**11/29** I had diarrhea 6x. I took immodium and pepto. 11/30 I had diarrhea 4x.

**12/1** I had diarrhea 3x. I got retested 12/2. 

**12/2** Test came back positive. I started Vanc PULSED DOSE. 

FMT FINALE: I reached out to 6 Infectious Disease doctors and found one who is going to do FMT via enema FRIDAY! She's having me stay on vanc until tomorrow night. I am excited but also VERY SCARED of this not working. Any FMT success stories? Did it take multiple FMT processes to work?

599,Biologic infusion to injection switch,LittleRayOfMoonshine,9,rawg6w,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/rawg6w/biologic_infusion_to_injection_switch/,0,"Hi friends. 
I’ve been taking infliximab (Remsima/Remicade) via intravenous infusion since early 2019 and my UC symptoms have been really well managed since then. No flare-ups of any note. 
Recently I’ve been offered the chance by the NHS to switch to the injection version of this. I’ve been told that they both use the same medicine but it would be myself administering the injection every 2 weeks opposed to an infusion at hospital every 8 weeks. 
I’m trying to weigh up the pros and cons before I make a decision. Has anyone made this switch before and able to offer any insight on what it’s like to change? Either from an IBD symptom or medicine side effect perspective. 

They called me to discuss and I asked them if the offer was for clinical reasons or for cost effectiveness. She said that the injection actually worked out slightly more expensive for them and it was more to protect the patients from exposure of travelling to and being in hospital. And I assume to protect their staff too. Which sounds fair to me. 

I take the day off from work on the day of the infusion and often have the next day off as well as I’m still fatigued and have brain fog that makes it hard to concentrate on work properly. Work are accommodating with this.  If I switched to injections every 2 weeks, did anyone notice a difference in the tiredness? Was it easier or worse to manage with the 2 weekly opposed to every 8 weeks? 

Clinically, as the infusions have been successful so far, I’m inclined to leave well alone. And from a selfish note my family live and work near the hospital so I can usually combine the appointment to meet up with them if their shifts permit. But I don’t want to cause any unnecessary risk to the hospital staff if it were safer for me to do it at home. 

Also, I get increased levels of anxiety before and after each infusion. My specialist says it’s a rare side effect of the medicine but didn’t rule it out being a cause. I’ve eliminated as much as I can from my lifestyle to reduce the anxiety. Notably alcohol and they offered me CBT which was really helpful. Has anyone else noticed this and did switching make a difference?

Thanks",2021-12-07 11:47:30
600,Only Mild Symptoms at Diagnosis?,korncobbcon,10,rao0jf,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/rao0jf/only_mild_symptoms_at_diagnosis/,3,"I am getting a colonoscopy this week and my GI is considering IBD and particularly Colitis. But I seem to be only having very mild symptoms compared to everything Ive read and heard about IBD. It sounds like the symptoms that usually lead to diagnosis are much more severe - like intense abdominal pains, diarrhea with lots of blood, etc.

My only symptoms over the last few months are: 
- Very mild abdominal sensations/discomfort (I wouldn’t even call it pain) mostly on my left side.
- Pretty much all of my stools are diarrhea, but never had any blood 
- Some uncomfortable bloating after eating, but its not every time and usually only with a larger meal

The only other things that could possibly be indicative of IBD is that my CRP levels on unrelated blood tests this year were elevated at 8mg/L in May and down to 4.6mg/L in September. And starting last night and all day today I have felt like I need to poop constantly, for which I went to the bathroom several times and little to nothing came out - I think this is “urgency” or “tenesmus” but I also have a lot of anxiety, especially the last few days, so hoping its just that. 

Has anyone been diagnosed before they have their first flare? And with such mild symptoms? Or is this looking like something other than IBD? Because every story Ive read and heard talks about severe pain and bloody stools.

During Oct 2019, Oct - Dec 2020, and Sept 2021 til now, I've been experiencing significant GERD and IBS, particularly burning stomach pain and constipation issues. My endoscopy and CT scans this year revealed I have constipation and GERD, and with following a low FODMAP and GERD friendly diets, and taking meds, I keep flaring up and my symptoms still persist. I've been on sucralfate, Omeprazole, hyoscamine, IB gard, and also miralax / fiber. During my flare ups, I've had extremely high levels of eosiniphils and reports of high fecal calprotectin, but they go down after October of each year. I've done allergy tests for basic things and nada.

What's odd is that while my colonoscopy came back looking ""healthy"", they didn't biopsy so we can't rule out colitis or gastritis. Does anyone here have IBD / colitis / gastritis / eosinophilic colitis and NOT have diarrhea or nausea? I'm baffled by despite all of these lifestyle / diet changes, I'm still having terrible pain. They're throwing meds at me and claiming I'm ""such a healthy 25 year old"" and that I ""can't have colitis because you experience constipation"".

Quick intro before I get into what I want to say: I’m 26 years old, have had Crohn’s disease since I was 16. Thankfully, my symptoms have always been fairly under control. I have 1-2 flares a year that budesonide usually takes care of within a few weeks. When I was first diagnosed 10 years ago, I was prescribed Mesalamine (Apriso). I took that medication for about 5 years. I came off of it at 21, I was feeling great, getting married and I thought heck, I don’t want to be on meds forever.
Well I did just fine up until about a year ago in 2020, when I started getting these horrible flares in my stomach and colon.
My GI was adamant that I go back on Mesalamine to control inflammation and prevent any complications. I tried apriso and immediately had to come off of it due to intolerance (terrible diarrhea that subsided as soon as I stopped the apriso)

Anyway fast forward to August 2021. I went in for my annual colonoscopy and they found quite a bit of microscopic inflammation. My GI said I need to get on some type of treatment to prevent cancer, etc.

She said to try lialda, that it is a bit different than apriso and might work better.

Anyway, I waited a long time to start the lialda because I was scared, but two weeks ago I mustered up the courage. Bad idea. 
My GI Told me to take two a day, but I decided to start with one.
I tolerated it well for all of three days, then by the fourth day I was on the toilet 6-7 times a day with severe abdominal cramping and I also had an acne flare (not sure if this was related).

By the fifth day, I felt like I was dying and decided to stop the medication.
Sure enough, within a few days, the diarrhea subsided. However, a number of things have stayed with me or gotten worse:
- still experiencing pretty bad abdominal cramping
- extremely constipated now (no diarrhea though)
- painful urination and pretty bad pelvic pain after passing a bowel movement 
- lethargy (no fever or anything)
- acne flare is still absolutely horrible

Anyway, what I’m worried about is that Mesalamine intolerance has led to something much worse, but Idk what. I can feel that something is not normal in my abdomen but I don’t know how to explain it... 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I have seen many threads about folks experiencing Mesalamine intolerance, but my question is, had that intolerance led to any severe complications? I’m worried I may have developed diverticulitis (never had before so idk how symptoms would
feel) but I could also just be overthinking...

I’ve had awful constipation with a constant need for a bowel movement and alternating days of diarrhea, not watery but very loose but also super narrow. I had on and off cramps in my lower right abdomen and pelvic area with those symptoms and I took some ibuprofen for a few days which didn’t help with the pain. Instead, I developed this constant (and I mean absolutely constant) burning pain from my lower right just above my hip down to my pelvic area and it’s worse if I walk a lot or cough. It’s burning cramps, and stabbing burning pain, it’s so unbearable I was up with the pain until 4am when I just passed out from exhaustion, woke up with the pain again at 8am. It doesn’t matter what I eat, when I eat, if I have a bowel movement or not, I drink tonnes of water and I eat very healthy. I don’t have blood in my stool, just yellow mucus, and I don’t have a fever. I feel nauseous but haven’t vomited. I previously had joint pain and mouth ulcers but those have gone while the pain in my abdomen got worse... having to wait another week for the scopes is making me so anxious because if it’s not intestinal issues I’m worried about ovarian problems. 

(Sometimes the pain is also felt at my waist on the right hand side and then it feels more like stabbing pain, which I know can be kidney related but I don’t have any UTI symptoms and my kidney functions came back clear last week.)

FYI I have been to a GI and we have a plan.

So long story short I started having diarrhea last August. Never found any evident of bacterial infection and I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy which was clear and I was labeled as having IBS and just anxious. 

2 GI's later after many blood,stool, and other tests I had a capsule endoscopy which shows inflammation and ulcers in the intestines (I am negative for h pylori, and c.dif). The GI gives me another colonoscopy and endoscopy using a pediatric scope to go as far as he could and confirmed ulcers in my intestines.

The GI doesn't think I have Chron's as I don't have many of the other symptoms. I haven't lost a lot of weight, I don't feel any pain in my stomach etc. He biopsied the ulcers and there was no sign of Chrons or Ulcerative Colitis. I also had a negative blood test for Chrons and Celiacs. He has proposed a I might have post infectious ibs and wants me on a lowfodmap diet. I guess the idea being to help have easy digestible food to help heal the ulcers. I am a little confused because in the meeting he also said ibs doesn't have any signs as it is a functional disease, which I already knew. Also low-Fodmaps from what I understand is to settle the digestion and slowly reintroduce food to see what you react to not to heal ulcers.

initially we all thought she lost her period and was having problems with her weight due to a thyroid issue, but her thyroid panels came back normal, and her thyroid ultrasound was all clear (she went to a couple of endocrinologists). after several gyno visits, she was finally prescribed some birth control. the first brand she was given managed to induce a period, but she had to switch to another since she was experiencing depression and mood swings. this brand doesn't seem to have induced a period, though.

we now believe it has to be something related to the gi issues she was having at the start of the year, since she still finds herself really sensitive to certain foods (+ barely any appetite). she's scheduled to see a gastroentorlogist in a couple of weeks. however, we're all honestly just stumped, since all of the doctors have been telling her she's ""fine"" when she clearly is not. i was thinking that perhaps someone on thissub can offer some advice.

I had covid in February of this year & it seems to jave made my acid reflux go nuts. My doctor put me on some medication to stop me producing acid. It seemed to help & stopped me being in so much pain from the acid. I also cut out spicy food etc. 
So for the last few months I've been getting this really bad pain in my right side at my ribs. My doctor said it was wind due to the acid reflux issues. It was getting worse over time & I also noticed the need to pee all the time. My doctor hasn't put me on antibiotics & the pain seems to reduce the longer I was on them. However when the antibiotics were out of my system the pain & sensation of needing to pee all the time came back. 
Last Monday I started getting really bad pains & rushed to the toilet. It felt like I had diarrhoea, it was very loose, & it just kept happening all day. It got to the point where it really started to hurt me & I was dreading going to the toilet. I was getting really bad pelvic cramps too & lower back pain & pain in both my sides around my rib areas. I actually don't even know if I would call it diarrhoea cause I would go to the toilet & feel the urgent urge to poop but nothing would come out for ages & even then on a small amount would come out. I had to eventually take pain killers & use a hot water bottle to try to lower the pain. It kept happening on Tuesday until late that night. I started to notice what I'm assuming was blood when I was wiping. I also noticed like mucus stuff, like slimy & not like usual poop. I put the blood down to the pain at my bum hole. On Wednesday I felt somewhat better & not as crampy, also no insane diarrhoea. 
Roll onto Friday afternoon & I got the urge to poop. That was the beginning of the next bout of pain etc. The cramps are unreal & so painful. They feel like really really bad period cramps. Again I noticed the blood & slime. I started taking pain killers again & limited my food intake. I felt somewhat better the next day, Christmas day but I woke up this morning pain again & the pooping feeling. I noticed more blood in the toilet again today but not a very large amount. Also the slime is there. 
Previously I've had the odd time of pain & needing to poop etc but not this bad. I can't get a doctors appointment until the new year as my doctor is closed for Christmas. I'm trying not to freak myself out but its getting harder especially when I notice the blood & along with the pain, it's very scary. Has anyone else with IBD experienced this? It has kind of ruined my Christmas a bit as I just can't seem to sit down & enjoy the time off from work. Thanks in advance!",2021-12-27 00:28:40

I'm in the middle of a nasty flare that started last month - a couple weeks after DC'ing budesonide.  The mesalamine I've been on for several weeks now has done nothing to help.

The upshot of this situation is that, with sometimes a dozen or more liquid stools a day, I'm going through a lot more toilet paper than usual, and noticed a few weeks ago that I was starting to run out much sooner than I expected.

So I went on Amazon to put in my usual order, which was scheduled to reach me on 23 December.  So far, so good.

I'm in the Pacific Northwest, and those of you in North America probably know by now that we've been hit by a rotten snowstorm, even bringing snow for the first time in five years to the coastal town where I live.  For the past five days, my Amazon package has been stuck in Idaho.

This morning, when I checked the tracking number, I saw that the package has finally hit the road.  I have three rolls left, have been going through as much as a roll a day, and live on an icy hill in a place where they don't salt the roads because it never snows.  Everything sent by mail - packages especially - takes an extra day to get here under the best of conditions.  I'm trying to figure out if I can hold out until Wednesday - when it should be warm enough to melt the ice - to go to the supermarket, or whether the package might possibly get here by then.

I never thought I'd be obsessively checking Amazon, Weather Underground and the DOT website just to find out whether I need to worry about running out of toilet paper.

\----------------------------------------------

UPDATE:  The Amazon update has it ""Out for Delivery""!  This means that it's coming from a place about two hours away, and probably won't arrive until this evening, but it's nearly here!

Thanks so much, everybody, for your many useful suggestions that will hopefully obviate this situation in the future.",2021-12-27 22:21:01
688,Mesalamine (Salofalk) and folic acid? Should I take it?,Hefty_Leek3834,6,rpx11g,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/rpx11g/mesalamine_salofalk_and_folic_acid_should_i_take/,9,"Hi all,

31M here, recently diagnosed with colitis.

For 3 months on 2 gram of Salofalk (mesalamine) per day. However, from day 1, my GI also prescribed me 10 gram of Folic Acid with explanation that Mesalamine reduce Folate from body.  
I knew that old type of medicine like Sulfasalazine reduce the folat, but was not sure about Mesalamine. However, I took it as my doctor said.

I achieved remission quickly, very low calprotectin, no blood, normal stool, but still sometimes I have diarhea with cramps in stomatch, a lot of gas, etc. I thought it is all from IBS.  
One weekend I left the city and forgot folic acid, and suddenly no stomatch pain, no cramps, no diarhea. I came back home, took folic acid, and boom, symptoms came back.

Then I did a research and find out that overdosage of folate is causing nervous stomatch system.

I stopped using folic acid again, and symptoms dissapeared.

My question is:

Do you guys take Folic Acid with Mesalamine? Is it really needed or my doctor made a mistake?

690,Sick & tired,jadkiss5,7,rqsdbk,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/rqsdbk/sick_tired/,9,"Hi everyone,
I think I posted on here some time ago following my colonoscopy while I was waiting for biopsy results. Essentially, I’ve had ongoing GI issues as long as I can remember (like back to elementary school and I’m 25 now). They worsened when I went away to college (I would throw up like at least once a week for no reason at all). And then in the last 3.5 years have become unbearable. I’ve had to leave work because of the nausea and cold sweats, only to get home and have diarrhea as well. Last April I went to visit my best friend in Florida and the following day was in excruciating pain in my lower abdomen, mostly on the left, that would come in waves until the diarrhea finally came. Then it was uncontrollable and there was blood in it, which prompted me to go to urgent care and then be sent to the ER. ER did a CT with contrast along with blood and urine tests to rule out other infections. They did the CT twice to confirm and then gave me a prelim diagnosis of colitis. Came home and had an appointment with a GI a few weeks later, and a colonoscopy and biopsy a few months after that. Both were negative for colitis. My GI tested for celiac, SIBO, and food allergies. All negative. Told me “well I guess you just have IBS” and sent me on my way with a Bentyl script because my symptoms had improved.

Well here I am, 7 months later and still in pain, still having diarrhea with almost every BM. I’m so frustrated and I really can’t accept that it’s “just IBS.” Nothing I do helps. I wake up every morning severely bloated with intense stomach pain. Sometimes it goes away and sometimes it ends with diarrhea. I feel like I can’t live my life and I’m so mad because everyone I speak to says “you should be happy you weren’t diagnosed with IBD” but I wish I was because at least I could start some sort of treatment plan instead of being miserable all the time. I’m reaching out to a new GI tomorrow but I just needed to vent as I’m currently in so much pain and feel like no one understands.",2021-12-29 00:05:46

What do *you* do to keep your toilet clean, especially during flares?  Since it's something we end up having to do more frequently than usual, I'm curious to know what works best for you - or if you've developed any good hacks for this.

I'm fortunate in that I live alone, but I'm sufficiently obsessive that it bothers me when the toilet isn't perfectly clean, so I can't let it go for long.  I'm fortunate that I don't live in a hard water area; but I learned years ago that any tank-based toilet cleaners eat into the gaskets around the base of the flushing mechanism, so are out of the question (besides, they do nothing to keep the area above the rim or any part of the seat clean).

I have IBD but I am in a remission so mostly I am ok, but I guess my stomach is very sensitive sometimes. 


In winter I usually feel more depressed (because of less sunlight I guess or I don’t know) and because of that I am even more sensitive in every way. In our country our typical Christmas food is very unhealthy - lots of fat and sweets. Normally I try to eat healthy because it makes me happier, and I am an adult living with my partner and we don’t care about traditions so we still eat the same at home so that’s not the problem. 


But visiting parents and grandparents … oh my god… it is always hell. My mum is talking about food only, and she doesn’t know the word “no”. I am trying to be strict but it is not easy. Trying to not eat too much of the “bad” food, but still… what is worse - gifts and leftovers. I got many sweets and I cannot say no to a gift. And maybe because of my depression I am weaker to fight these situations and I cannot even say no to leftovers for taking home for later. So today I ate some weirdly tasting potato salad and lot of cauliflower (normally healthy food but very gassy for me) and now I’m sitting on toilet with storm in my belly and being angry at myself. Fuck Christmas and my depression making me weaker. Rant over.

I have tried to bring this up to various DRs who seem to shun the idea and change the subject immediately without considering that the CHS caused my IBD. Now I feel as though I may need cannabis to control my IBD as it has gotten increasingly worse over the past year. Have any of you experienced anything like this? I know this is probably a rare occurrence as CHS is very rare itself. Reaching...",2021-01-01 23:11:28

My first experience with IBD was a mild flare up about two years ago. At the time i waited a long time to go the doctor, and once I did go and got a colonoscopy appointment, the flare-up passed by the time I was expected in the hospital. In other words, they didn't see anything and I was good for about a year.

The second time I got similar symptoms and went to the doctor much quicker. I was able to get a colonoscopy in time and they confirmed I had UC but the doc seemed hesitant to make a judgement on the severity - mainly he couldn't tell me if this was chronic. Nevertheless I got a prescription for mesalazine and was told to come back for a follow up a few months later. Then covid happened and my follow up got delayed but I eventually went and was told that everything seemed fine. I had no symptoms and the inflammation was gone, no sign of ulcers or scarring. Great. I was told i could stop taking my meds.

Now for the last few weeks I have been noticing some things that have me worried. Mainly bright red blood in my stool and the feeling I need to go even though I don't really need to. No diarrhea or very loose stools, if anything I'm more constipated. I'm not in a lot of pain, barely any. But then I also wasn't in pain the last two times I flared up. The blood isn't always present either. There's however always some mucus, which is the big warning sign for me.

I should point out that this all started after a particularly bad bout of constipation, so for a while I was convinced it was the work of a bad internal hemorrhoid - I have been prone to these things in the past.

I'm worried and I'm dreading having to go through the entire prep again to get YET ANOTHER colonoscopy. What are the chances that this is not a flare up and just the results of constipation and a hemorrhoid? Should I just call my doc, explain the situation and ask for another prescription? Or should I just accept that the next step is a colonoscopy before I do anything else?

I hate this. I should never have stopped my meds. Even when I was in remission I kept dreading the day I'd have to deal with this garbage again.

 How do I know if I have nflammatory bowel disease or infectious mesenteric adenitis? Multiple CT scans and with bloodwork such as C reactive protein and sedimentation rate


REASON FOR CTS - lower right abdomen pain, and on occasion pain where liver is.

I have had 3 CT scans since October 2020, and the recent 2 have shown swollen lymphnodes in my mesentary. I have been given steroids to treat these. In 2019 I had CT scan with no swollen lymphnodes. But in 2018 I had a CT scan which have shown swollen lymphnodes at .8cm. What is going on?

12/28/2020 CT-

1. Profuse mesenteric lymphadenopathy which supports the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease or infectious mesenteric adenitis. Further workup for informatory bowel disease is indicated

2.  There is mild hepatomegaly and diffuse steatosis without intrahepatic biliary dilatation.

11/15/2020 CT

1. Multiple subcentimeter sized lymph nodes throughout the mesentery especially in the root of the mesentery and also in the right lower quadrant which could be reactive or adenitis due to possible mesenteritis.

2.Generalized fatty infiltration of liver parenchyma, no focal lesions. Gallbladder shows mild generalized increased attenuation, may be due to sludge or because comparatively the liver is low-attenuation from fatty infiltration.

10/30/2020 CT

1. There are no enlarged abdominal lymph nodes

2. Fatty liver

12/12/19 CT

1. There is no vascular or lymph node enlargement. Numerous normal in size central mesenteric lymph nodes have unchanged appearance.

11/18/18 CT

1. Innumerable mildly prominent mid mesenteric and right lower quadrant mesenteric lymph nodes measuring up to 0.8 cm. Mild mid mesenteric stranding along the course of the superior mesenteric vein. No free intra-abdominal fluid or air is noted. No focal fluid collections. No adjacent bowel abnormality. Normal appendix. Findings may represent mesenteritis and short-term interval follow-up CT abdomen and pelvis (3-6 months) is recommended to ensure resolution of these findings, as additional lymphoproliferative processes are not entirely excluded",2021-01-03 10:19:58

I haven't been producing higher levels of saliva to the point where my mouth is filling up with it but it can become uncomfortable. I've gone from cleaning my teeth twice a day to sometimes six times a day

I've done a little bit of reading online and I was aware you could get ulcers in your mouth area and that changes can occur with your salvia.

730,What COULD I have?,RegularWinner4843,0,kpwo9i,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/kpwo9i/what_could_i_have/,11,"Hey guys,

I obviously know I cannot be diagnosed by reddit. I will have a colonoscopy in approximately a month but I was not given an exact date yet. Previously I had a gastroscopy and was diagnosed with H. Pylori and chronic Gastritis. 

These are my symptoms:

No matter what I eat ( I have tried many variations of eating, left out every food at least once for enough time etc.) I always feel bloated and constipated in the evening. Only in the evening. After my meals I usually feel fine. My main symptom is that I feel like I have to pass gas but I just cannot. It feels like it accumulates and I cannot pass it. Obviously this starts to hurt in my lower abdomen. I would locate the pain/pressure rather centrally. I also feel like there is pressure on my rectum (not sure if I mean the right thing, I am talking about the end of my digestive track actually basically my anus/the area right before it).

I do not think the chronic Gastritis is causing the problem since, from what I have read, Gastritis is rather characterized by upper abdominal pain, which I indeed have had occasionally but very rarely. It seems to be diet related while the feeling of not being able to pass gas persists every night no matter what I eat. I am have this symptom since May/June 2020 and have not once had diarrhea.

The colonoscopy is to check whether I have IBD. Based on my description what do you guys think, is this IBD? If not what else could it be? At this point I would be even more happy if they would diagnose me with IBD instead of finding nothing, since then I would know what I am up against.",2021-01-04 01:16:50

I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome 2 years ago. That is a connection tissue disease that affects the collagen. It started with hip problems, wrist problems, knee, ankle, and every joint in the body. Even the jaw.. I had trismus, trouble swallowing and some other manifestations. Oh and extreme fatigue and weakness.. especially after eating. 

Now for years I have had stomach problems. I'm 30 y/o now and they started at 19 when I was at the army.  I started puking everything I ate and couldn't even swallow anything. I was diagnosed with Ulcers, Gastritis and H.Pylori at the time. I also coughed up blood at one point. After that for years I have been complaining of stomach pain, diarrhea alternating with constipation and developed sensitivity to foods. Carbs especially made me tired, weak and itchy after eating. I have been told it was only IBS, so I ceased going to the doctors for that.

Over the last 6 months my whole shit changed literally. I won't get into so much detail, but it started with mucus and solid shit covered with little blood to full on blood, watery stools and incontinence. Pain localization was also different and instead of being around the belly button or above it became near the anus and left lower stomach and on the side and around my back.(after eating). There are a lot of other symptoms that I won't get into. I also lost 25lbs in a year.

What i'm asking is that: I have been to the GI and he performed a rectal exam and basically saw the inflammation and blood and diagnosed me with UC on the spot (my dad has UC and had type 1 diabetes at age 47). He started me with a treatment of mesalazine ema for 28 days+predisone 20mg for 30 days and some potassium to balance the electrolytes.

He told me to start the treatment and only then do a colonscopy once everything settles down because of the active inflammation.  Is that common?

I'm not scared at all, I have felt shitty for so long so it doesn't surprise me one bit, but with my issues and Ehlers Danlos, UC is a co-morbidity and I really don't know if like some of what the stuff that i'm feeling and has been attributed to EDS can actually be an IBD manifestation? could it be? the Doctor said that the joint issues couldn't be as a result of it. 

I'm also concerned that I might be having more issues other than UC in the stomach because my history with stomach issues is damn long and the pain was different before. He said that the colonscopy when performed will not be a full colonscopy either because of the risk involved. Basically I feel like I want to see exactly what issues I have throughout my whole stomach in case we don't miss anything else, so i'm kind of confused.

And last thing, I'm really unsure whether I should start treatment before the colonscopy. And I'm really concerned about doing it myself instead of being submitted to the hospital for that. I don't trust myself lol. Everything is so unclear and there are too many issues that I have no answer to. I react to so many foods, even the ones that are allowed with an IBD.. and my reactions look like some kind of allergy and I hate being tired and fatigued after eating and being itchy.. and my skin also starts to peel(I have seborrheic dermatitis according to doctor, but maybe it is connected?). 

Anyways, i'd love your input guys and gals! Thank you so much for reading this.",2021-01-05 23:20:19

I have usual symptoms like periumbilical and lower right quadrant pain but the following seem to be less common.

I've had pretty much all imaginable tests over the past year ( abdo & thoracic CTs, Enterogram, X-Ray, US, EUS, Colonoscopies, Upper endoscopy, Capsule endoscopy, bloods..etc,etc. Nothing was found other than apparent Crohn's in my ileum and petechiae (red spots) in my duodenum.

\- Constant pain in the lower thoracic part of the back, right on the spine, likely around T11-T12-L1 where the thoracic and lumbar spine meet. I've had 3 acute episodes of sharp squeezing pain on this spot. It literally feels like something is constantly squeezing or pushing against this vertebrae.

\- Middle and upper back pain. It always feels sore.

\- Epigastric and upper right quadrant tenderness. I also get what feels like cramps between my belly button and sternum.

\- Dyspepsia

\- Pain that comes and goes under my ribs in different locations.

\- Yellowish or tan, mushy and bulky stools. They are full of food residues, often appear greasy and some pieces tend to float. I usually go only once or twice, generally in the morning, upon waking up with an urgency feeling.

\- Unexplained foamy urine without protein

I've recently started Remicade so hopefully I will feel better in a not so far future.

I was diagnosed with ibs in 2015. In August, I contacted my regular doctor about abdominal pain and some other things that made her think it was more than that. After an Mri, my gi doctor said that he thinks it might be crohns in my small intestine, but we need more tests to confirm. He said that we would have everything figure out within two months, which at the time felt like an eternity to get some answers. Well, its been a lot longer than two months. I have had multiple scans and a pill capsule camera thing and everything has either been normal but that doesn't rule out crohns or maybe crohns but not enough to diagnose. We are working on scheduling a balloon endoscopy to try to look deeper into my small intestine than the regular one, but that might not be happening any time soon because of covid. Its labeled as an elective procedure, which kind of suck because there hasn't really been other tests that have shown difinatly or excluded crohns. I just want a test that will say yes or no you have crohns, but i know its very complicated. 

Its been a long time where I've been in too much pain to really do anything in life. I'm in a weird state where I'm wishing they find something because then we will have treatment options, but also wishing they don't find anything because crohns sounds like a mess of a disease. You guys are all very strong people and I admire you greatly. If I do have crohns, it must be pretty mild if its this hard to find, so I can't even imagine what worse will be like. 

I was on prednisone for a while, which helped a lot. But I have stopped it now and everything has come back. We are also hoping to get a good diagnosis before I start taking it some more because prednisone isn't really a solution just a bandaid. I think that crohns would explain a lot of whats been going on with me for 6+ years, but idk because they haven't actually found enough to diagnose. I'm just sick of being sick and have been very scared to eat much food so I'm very low in energy and not really able to do much in life.

My doctors have been telling me that there's blood in my urine and my GI is saying it could potentially be side effects from Humira making my bladder inflamed or something.

I moved through the usual progression of medication before finally getting onto Infliximab in 2014. After a long period of remission my specialist suggested coming off Infliximab and just using maintenance drugs (Azathioprine with Pred when needed) I lasted about a year before a bad flare up and fistulating abcess caused them to change my diagnosis to Crohns and me to needing stronger medication, at which point they moved me to Humira so that I had a bit more autonomy over when and where I did the medicine. That lasted up until the beginning of 2020 when I slowly stated to show symptoms again, I went through the usual rigmarole of trying courses of steroids, but with everything that was going on with the virus and being in lockdown, I kind of just sucked it up and hoped that it would just settle down (obviously never ever happens). At the end of October/November I finally went in for a scope and between that and blood tests that showed extreme inflamation with good levels of Humira and no antibodies in my blood, they decided that I'm having a non-reaction to the medicine and would need to change medicines. Cut to most recently, I started Stelara on the 29th of December and so far have show no real improvements whatsoever, I understand it can take upto 3 or 4 weeks so I'm not panincking too much.

Anyway, I live in the UK and so obviously everything so far has been provided by our amazing NHS. In 2018 I married my now wife who lives in the US. We held off on any big moves right away due to some life stuff we both had going on but we eventually decided that I should move there due to a lower cost of living where we would be based and more work opportunities over all. The only thing that ever really concerned me was the state of health insurance over there (which she currently doesn't have). It never really worried me too much before because I'd likely be able to get it through my company, but having had the non-reaction and potentially discussing surgery with my Doctors here, I 'm really starting to have serious doubts as to whether its a sensible move. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone could weigh in on the difficulty of getting a good doctor that would support me this far into my diagnosis, but also the risk of the potential financial disaster? Also my wife is convinced that there will be medication that is available over there that isnt here and I just dont really see that being the case, but obviously I don't know for sure.",2021-01-07 17:50:35

I was hospitlised at 16 when i was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. A year before that i was in my final years of school i was depressed and and failing all my classes cause i was just in pain with cramps passing blood and hoping no one could hear my stomach rumbling in class, I would hold it in all day then walk home (leaking eww) then just blow up the toilet with diarrhea and blood (utterly humilating) all while keeping it to myself until everyone noticed i was pale as a ghost and losing lots and lots of weight. 

I was to proud and humiliated to go to anyone cause my god is it an embarrrassing illness no one can grasp.

anyways have chronic symptoms under the medication predsol enemas which helped me get to college and thats when i started smoking...

Now im not recommending anyone to go buy and pack of ciggies but it did reduce all my symptoms to the point where i havent had medication for 10 years to be exact I am 27 now. ( the symptoms were always there and still hindered me in ways) But all in all i was able to do a 9-5 labour work and come home. Even did boxing and jujitsu and competeted quite abit. I was still in and out of work but were able to work several jobs 2 years at one job then  few 1 years but mainly 4/5 months at a time

I quit smoking 4 weeks ago. And im physically unable to do anything. I back to sqaure one. Been like this since the 14/12/20 getting shitter (heh) by the day. 

I am going to try patches and maybe go to vaping and get back to you too see if symptoms alleviate.

It could be that nicotine patches and a very strong Eliquid and bring some powerful relief. 

Anyone else got experience with nicotine as an effective treatment for IBD?

Hi, 
I might have ibs or an ibd disease , my doctors are ruling out some other illnesses /allergies out first, but I was wondering if I can still eat takis /spicy foods with it? I've never really had a big problem with spicy food and eating. 

the only food problem i've really ever had is gluten and dairy and some berries that make my stomach hurt and my tongue itchy/dry. 

however i know that some syndromes and stuff can start randomly and it might change my tolerance to spicy /sour foods. I also would be so sad if I can't/shouldn't eat takis anymore or any other spicy/sour foods :(

today I had really bad bloody mucus diarrhea & constipation stool at the same time& i had to go to the doctor & now i'm getting tested. kinda nervous tbh.",2021-01-08 02:44:00

I was recently diagnosed with crohn's disease and my doctor gave me Mezavant (2 pills a day). I've been on it for 2 months. Since taking it my joints have been driving me crazy. They are constantly aching or in shooting pain if I do any light activity. Usually, I walk a lot and it's no issue. Now if I walk for 30 minutes I can't stand after that or my knees/ankles are having sharp pain.
I told my doctor this and she was just saying it's part of having crohn's... But I didn't have this issue before...!!!!!! My muscles are also constantly sore.
Obviously pooping a million times a day sucks and this is still an improvement but it's definitely hindering my ability to do normal things.
What do I do?!?!?;
Should I push for a different medication or to have my joints monitored if that's a thing...???? I'm worried I'm going to develop arthritis if that hasn't already happened.

I do a lot of things diet and herb related but suggestions on that front are welcome 🤠

I have been suffering from liquid bowel movement since November. My blood tests and stool samples showed inflammation (not alarmingly high, but higher than normal) I had a colonoscopy a couple of days ago and they suspect microscopic colitis, they took biopsies and I’ll have to wait for those. 

They also saw a lot of bile acid in my colon (I had my gallbladder removed a year ago because I had painful episodes for 3 years -> gallstones) 

I started on Questran and I was wondering if any of you have any advise on how to drink it.

Anyway, Wednesday morning, I woke up having to deficate every hour. It kept on going on and on like clockwork, I can't even stay asleep. I had to wake up every hour to go to the bathroom to have liquid and mucusy/tarry stooles. So I've been getting sleep in hour incriminates. I end up losing fluids that I almost collapsed. I'm doing fine now, since I made sure to keep sipping water or pedialite.

I'm 31/M. Never in my life have I had urgency last this long and be this urgent. 

Later that day, I checked my temperature, I was running a 102. I'd check my temperature throught the day, and it was floating between 99.9 - 102.9. My fever went away Thursday,but the frequent dedication has not made any improvement. 

Till this day, I have no fever, but my diarrhea is real bad. 

I went to the ER, as I have no insurance as I'm 1099. They ran blood work and ran an xray on my stomach, but no colonoscopy nor stoole sample. They said I had non-infectious  gastroenteritis and to watch my diet.

As I've done tons of googling, the stomach flu lasts no longer than a few days, nor does it cause diareah that frequently for that long. I'm on  my 5th day with no improvement, aside from no longer having a fever like I did Wednesday and Thursday. 

The only thing that confuses me, is that I've never had any other issues that lead to UC. I mean, I've rarely have a hard stoole, but I don't have the healthiest diet either. But I rarely get stomach cramps, or any of the other symptoms. So it just came on all kd the sudden. 

I'm worried it's UC. But without a PCP, idk how to rule that out. This is so uncomfortable and I'd give anything to just make it go away. I don't want to poop every hour for the rest of my life.

I (F28) had my first colonoscopy two weeks ago after nearly five years of bowel issues. I was regular all of my life but five years ago I started having constipation/incomplete evacuation. Lately, it's become more of a mix between constipation and diarrhea.

The doctor found ""multiple diffuse erosions in the whole colon"" and ""localized erythema and friability in the proximal rectum."" I also have minor internal and external hemorrhoids.

They took biopsies to try to rule out colitis.

I received a message from my doctor last night that they got the biopsy results back, which did confirm inflammation, but that they are going to wait to discuss the results in more detail until my telehealth appointment in two weeks.

I hate waiting, especially in light of what sounds like bad news, and was wondering if anyone here could speak to my results in the meantime. I know I shouldn't self diagnose, but erosions + inflammation sounds like ulcerative colitis.

I have been held hostage by my bathroom issues the last five years of my life, and look forward to getting to the root of my problem. I encourage anyone suffering from similar symptoms to seek medical help so they can do the same.

Thanks everyone.

EDIT: I just messaged my doctor for more info and she said that ""it's not clear at this point if it is infectious or chronic--the biopsies were not diagnostic of either."" Does anyone have any idea why that would be? Does it just mean I'll have to get more testing?

EDIT2 PATHOLOGY RESULTS: Pathology found ""granulomatous colitis with no chronicity + patchy active ulceration"" in my random colon, and mild to moderate diffuse chronic inflammation in my rectum. I'm doing more blood work and stool tests. I hate when people don't update their posts after they figure the thing out, so I will keep updating when I learn more.

       Last week, I got a call back from my surgeon with the biopsy results and she told me I have ulcerative colitis.  I am 18 and this is my first ever “flare” I think it is what you call it. For the past 3-4 months I’ve been dealing with health issues that had progressively been getting worse. For the first month or two, I had bleeding in my stool and about one day a week I would have this such intense pain in my abdomen. The only way I felt better was by lying onto my side. All my life I’ve been suffering with constipation on and off, so I thought maybe I had hemmorroids or possibly a prolapsed rectum. It didn’t explain this almost acid-like stabbing pain in my stomach, but it could explain the bleeding and mucous. I was going to the bathroom every 3 days but when I had to go, it would be in large amounts. I would have the urge to go all night (nothing would come out) and go maybe 5-6 times before I decided to sleep. At first it would be hard stool then turn into diarrhoea at the end. I called my doctor and he prescribed me miralax and told me that I had enlarged intestines from years of on and off constipation. So, I took miralax which didn’t do much for my symptoms. The bleeding continued to get worse and this is when he referred me to a surgeon bc he couldn’t see any hemmorroids. 
        
       The surgeon was super nice and empathetic with what I’ve been dealing with on a daily basis. She had me get a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy done, which the prep was probably one of the worst days of my life. I had such severe cramping, hunger, and burning everytime i went to the bathroom. They also had me wait like 7 hours in the hospital before the procedures. After they were done, she told me she found inflammation in my stomach and large intestine. My intestines also weren’t enlarged lol. She also said she didn’t see any ulcers but my symptoms started 2.5 months ago so it’s all very very new. There weren’t any ulcers but everytime she tried to take a biopsy, I would bleed. She also found a “nodule” but couldn’t see it w my scope. She thinks it could be a benign tumour but need to see it with an MRI. 
         
       Anyways, this has been really hard to cope with. I know it isn’t as bad as I went to the doctor early. I have been doing everything in my power to stay healthy. I noticed cutting out dairy has stopped my constipation (with the help of morning coffee). I try to avoid animal meats but fish is just one of those foods I can’t part with. 
        
        I think the hardest part is the fact that people just don’t understand. I’m tired all day. I’m stressed about going to the bathroom and when I do, i almost feel like i have to pass out. I had to call into work or leave work bc my stomach pain gets too much where I have to lie down on the dirty floor and wait to go home. People see me and think I am okay when really inside my body is actively fighting itself which explains why i’m so freaking tired. I’ve been getting psoriasis on my scalp and a few other places, and weird skin rashes that look like eczema. It’s going to be a tough journey, but it helps to find communities and people to relate to. 
        
       I kinda just wanted to say all of this because it could help someone like me to get the courage to call a doctor. I thought i was being dramatic by being tired or being in pain, when really i was dealing w something much more serious. I am going to hopefully see a GI doctor soon to get medication to calm down the inflammation. If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. I honestly don’t have many people to talk to and most people just don’t understand ya know. I didn’t have all the symptoms for UC (diarrhoea) so I thought “no it could never be me” when after testing it was. My intestines are bleeding pretty much and I just thought it was hemmorroids. Please see a doctor if you have bleeding and don’t try to solve all of your issues online. UC was the last thing on my mind because my symptoms were a bit different. But yeah thanks for reading.


Update:

       This is sort of a mini rant. I live in England, but I am American so the health care is different. At first I used the US military hospital at a military base so they had some urgency when I told them my issues. However, the NHS won’t book me in for a month or two. It’s so obnoxious because I’m bleeding every day (it has went down due to dietary changes) but there is also a possible tumour! I don’t want to get worse then I am and I want to stop the inflammation in my intestines before I start to develop ulcers causing more damage. I just don’t get it and it’s so discouraging...",2021-01-15 11:47:39

My doctors doesn't know and doesn't believe there is a link between IBD symptoms and Covid but I am really curious if there is any research, forum, people out there that were in the same boat as I am.

Gradually over the next few months things pick up and become more common like loose bowel movement or constipation, Fatigue, blood in my stool and mucus, stomach cramps and weight loss. I genuinely felt crappy so i see my Rhumatology pharmacist and brought it up with her for her to blow it off essential an say it’s highly unlikely you’ve anything wrong with you GI wise.. So i was absolutely defeated due to this and left without much answers. 

Roll onto last year where things escalated my CRP levels were in the 40s and developed anaemia to the point of my iron levels being 2.1 After that i’d developed anterior uveitis as well during the summer months. So now i was angry an phoned my local GP and explained how i have these symptoms and no one is listening to me. 
Well let’s say she’s angry because the bleeding is ringing alarm bells in her head and she doesn’t understand why it wasn’t picked up sooner especially after saying to the Rhumatology Pharmacist. She orders a stool sample to be taken that comes back with my Calprotein being 879 which is raised so Rhumatology get involved and order a Colonoscopy. 

So i have been for my first Colonoscopy and MRI of GI Tract? it wasn’t the worst experience I’ve had but the prep was absolutely brutal and the worst part of it. 
My results came back to be honest with you all. I’m so confused and defeated by the results they come back clean however they found minor bleeding then the MRI is clean as well. 

Thankfully my Rhumatology doctor is a lovely woman who believes me at face value along with my calprotein results being raised. 
She’s confused as well and suspects a IBD however is on the fence as it looks like it’s either a one off or it’s only starting to manifest?? I’m worried as the inflammatory condition i have can go hand in hand with GI issues as I’ve already got the eye problems associated with it. She’s chosen to put me on a new TNF to see if this helps and in the meantime to get another stool sample.

I am newly diagnosed as having crohn's, but have been having symptoms for about 7 years. I never checked for anything before but as soon as they did colonoscopy they said it's mild crohn's as I was in a self induced remission (I was feeling good at time of colonoscopy). They still put me on Mezavant.... But since taking it I'm having a lot of body aches and very bad joint pain, fatigue, brain fog, increased abdominal pain, etc. My pooping has improved a lot but these other symptoms are taking over my life!
 I'm thinking that I would like to go off of medication and just keep trying natural method/diet. I felt a lot better before mentally.... Even if I had to poop a lot more. The medication is making me feel like I'm going further into a path of pain and making me feel hopeless and very depressed.

Hi

I'm taking budesonide and azathioprine twice a day (total 100 mg) for my crohn's. I have ileal type of crohn's. So, initially I had to take budesonide thrice a day for a month, and taper it twice a day next month, followed by once a day next month ( a total of three months) and then stop. This is my last month to take it and taking it once only in morning. My doctor told me to regularly get my blood tests done. For first two months, my CRP and Esr both were within normal range. But this month CRP is 10 mg/L and Esr 41 mm/hr. Can that be due to tapering of budesonide. I'm not having any crohn's symptoms now and feeling really well after a long time.

I can't get off Uceris or my symptoms come back (been on it or prednisone for over a year straight now other than when trying to get off to see if various biologics are working...none have so far). I wasn't sharing any symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when he threw this out there about getting tested so I really don't know why he brought it up.

853,Looking for advice,Thathippiezak,8,l2cbkv,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/l2cbkv/looking_for_advice/,5,"Not diagnosed IBD, but I (23F) have seen two GI’s, and had an endoscopy, 2 colonoscopies, a pill capsule endoscopy, SIBO test, stool tests up the wazoo, 3 gastric emptying studies, and a few other tests that I can’t think of right now, all showing normal with the exception of my endoscopy- that showed GERD. 

Some backstory, 
Around probably five years ago now, I got sick with back to back bouts of either gastritis or gastroenteritis, and couldn’t even keep down water. I did not have insurance so I did what I could at home (aka soup and sleep) but was never truly “recovered” moreso had good days and bad ones. Flash forward to living like that for 2 years now, I finally have insurance, and I’ve officially lost around 15-20lbs (I am a very petite person to begin with, I only weighed *maybe* 120lbs at my heaviest). The first doc I saw (my primary at the time) just wanted to test my poop then put me on a random medication without testing. 
I finally got a referral to a GI, and at this point, due to my symptoms (weight loss, nausea, vomiting, relentless diarrhea, but also bowel movements that would shift on the Bristol stool scale, debilitating stomach pains and cramps, bloating to the point I look 20 weeks pregnant and my skin on my stomach is itchy, noisy gut, and trapped and non trapped gas) she ran the standard tests while I was waiting to get into the GI I really wanted to see (the one I was at I saw years ago for blood sugar problems and they told me tums would cure my hypoglycemia, so I wanted to to go the top ranked hospital in my state because I dealt with them for other issues before as a teen and were good). I’ve been seeing this GI for maybe two years now, and she has run a battery of tests on me, all with no results. (This will be relevant later, in January 2020 I got really sick with a “viral infection from hell” verbatim what my doc said, and was on prednisone for a week or two, which I noticed seemed to fix my other problems as well) She treated me for SIBO, under the guise that I had a false negative test. Almost a year later, I got insanely sick and began pooping blood. A trip to the ER later, as per my PCP, and I find out I have c diff(JUL/AUG 2020). Treated for c diff with vanco, successfully, I’m now negative for both toxin and PCR and my symptoms are worse than they ever have been post treatment. My primary assumed I still had some inflammation from c diff going on and prescribed prednisone to help. 
A few weeks have gone by (maybe even a month or more) and I still don’t feel right, my symptoms are worse than they were before, and my GI keeps saying PI-IBS(which I get, and understand that may be the case, but I *seriously* believe I have an underlying condition, besides just IBS) after some instance she agrees to do another colonoscopy and finally agrees that my symptoms are too extreme for PI-IBS, and orders more tests. In December, I had my follow up with her, and after much discussion, mostly on my side about how if I have IBS then why are steroids helping me, where they’re very rarely/never used for IBS, and why all the diet changes and everything else I’ve done on my end to my lifestyle hasn’t helped it, she agreed to put me on a steroid and decided Entocort (2, 3mg capsules, *opened* and consumed in applesauce) was the best option, follow up in a month (today). 
My symptoms have done a *complete* 180°. I’m pooping maybe once or twice a day instead of 5-15 times, little to no bloating, nausea, essentially all the symptoms I’ve been experiencing and living with for the last almost 5 years have damn near disappeared. 
When telling that to my GI’s nurse on the follow up call, and asking what the plan of action would be, she said it’s doctor dependent but I’ll likely either begin tapering off it or stay on it a little longer then taper off. 

Please correct me if I’m wrong, but where all my biopsies and visual examinations have come back normal, and I have 20 feet of small intestine that hasn’t been biopsied yet, and the steroids are *helping me* shouldn’t we be looking at diagnosing me with whatever is causing the inflammation that seems to be in my small intestine, so we can treat me for the cause, instead of just taking me off meds that were and are helping me with seemingly no other plan of action? I’m getting another call back probably in the morning, but I’m at a loss at this point, because I feel like I finally have my life back, and now it might get taken away again, if anyone wants more info I’m happy to provide, and I know Reddit isn’t doctors, but my doctor doesn’t seem to be helping, and I just want to confirm my suspicions before I switch to a different GI, since my PCP also seems to think in the same way I do",2021-01-22 01:59:02

859,Guess what's back... Back again... >< (Venting),WhatAmPsyDoing,18,l40tiy,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/l40tiy/guess_whats_back_back_again_venting/,6,"Hey everyone. I apologize in advance for this wall of text, I'm just so incredibly frustrated and disheartened...        

I'm 33F, diagnosed with Crohn's since I was about 12. I've been relatively stable on Entyvio and Lialda for a couple years. Back in 2013 (I think), I started my master's program on a liquid diet (yaaay Ensure) and after however long it took for the trio to kick in, Lialda, and Humira and methotrexate injections got me *essentially* in remission. I was still having some problems with bleeding every so often, but at least I *felt* okay.          

I'm now at the tail end of my doctorate with just a little writing (okay a lot, but I write ungodly fast) left for my dissertation before I can be Dr. WhatAmPsyDoing... And my Crohn's is acting up. I'm bleeding again. I'm getting incredibly painful spasms in my intestines again. I'm becoming afraid to eat again (not that I have an appetite anyway, but still)... It's partially my fault. When COVID-19 hit, I got scared and stopped my methotrexate. I know, I know. I'd yell at me too. I was stable, I thought I'd be okay. And to be fair, I have been, until now...           

The gastro who got me stable died a few years ago, unexpectedly. He had no professional will, so I was left hanging, essentially. He was a family friend, a good doctor, and a kind man. The guy before him, the one who diagnosed me, moved to a different state to focus on research. He came to my high school graduation recital.  The guy who prescribes my stuff now... I don't like him and I don't trust him. I had to *push* him to prescribe and seek authorization for my MTX shots, and I had to repeatedly tell him the dosage I was supposed to be on. I've been out of Levsin for at least a year — but that hasn't mattered because I've been mostly okay. I feel like he doesn't believe I have Crohn's, even though he literally has my entire medical record from all of my other doctors. He eventually prescribed the right stuff and his office staff worked hard to get things authorized, but... He doesn't do telehealth, so the last person I've spoken to was his PA. I'm terrified to tell them I either have to switch from Entyvio or go back on MTX because I'm afraid they'll want to do something that makes me worse in other ways. I'm afraid I don't have the energy to fight with him, demand treatment, be my own advocate, finish my research, AND manage my full time job.            

What complicates this further, I suppose, is that I can't take steroids anymore. While they help with the GI issues, they make every other system in my body freak out, including my heart. So there is no quick fix available to me, I don't think. Complicating things even MORE, I was *just* starting to look for a rheumatologist for a (maybe?) connective tissue disorder or whatever is going on, because I'm in pain *constantly,* my joints do seriously weird things, and — like right now I'm losing feeling in my left arm for no discernible reason — my vision is blurry and doubled, but it was fine earlier... And it's not even my joints that hurt, I don't think. It's weird. Anyway, before I get too far off topic...          

TL;DR - First ""actual"" flare in years and I feel so hopeless. I'm getting worse by the day, I'm scared, I'm exhausted but I can't sleep, I don't know how I'm going to do this, and I miss having a decent doctor.

Edit: I got autocucumbered, fixed it.",2021-01-24 15:56:27

A couple months ago, I met with another GI who suggested I get a colonoscopy, so I did and finally was diagnosed correctly! She prescribed me the steroid Budesonide which not only fixed my IBD immediately, but also cleared my Seborrheic Dermatitis (something I've also struggled with ever since I've had IBD) right up!

Does anyone have days where there stomach feels off not in nausea way but like feels if you fart the world will end. Happens after had fast food or something like that. Doctors think it could be UC but I don’t know because my bowels are normal one day the the next just a mess! If anyone who has been though this can you explain the type of Symptoms I can expect just so I know what may be happening? I know I will need to wait for a GI to give me a solid answer but I’ve had issues for years been on IBS meds that helped but since November it’s been horrible my fecal cal was very high 393 but I have seen people here saying theirs have been upwards of 1000+ any help would be amazing",2021-01-28 21:55:07

I'll try to be brief but I'm concerned what I'm experiencing is different enough from most posts that I'm worried.

Initially in October - fairly sudden onset of bad stomach pain, pooping mucus and blood 4-6+ times a day. My poop quickly lost all solidity. Went to see my gp who put me on mesalazine and booked me in for a colonoscopy. Calprotectin came back 1800.

November - things had calmed down a bit but not great. Colonoscopy was stopped after they couldn't get past my splenic flexure. Biopsy taken of my intestinal wall which showed acute mild inflammation. Referred to consultant.

December - things have calmed down somewhat, pain is mostly gone but stool firmness is lacking and I've started to get joint pain/itchy eyes and scalp among other strange issues. Pooping 2-3 times a day fluffy poops, some days I have moments where I have to poop out mucus. No blood as far as I can tell.

January - same as December. Stomach pain occasionally returns around meal times. Blood tests done which show no signs of inflammation despite my poops not being normal and my joints aching every day. Calprotectin came back 100.

Does this actually sound like an ibd to you guys because it seems to have gone away very easily and isn't half as bad as what I read from some people. Also I'm concerned that my bowel symptoms appear to be improving whist my joints/itchings aren't; is this normal? While sometimes I get the feeling I need to go to the toilet very soon I can always hold it for a while if required. These times are normally just mucus/bloody mucus though. 

Thanks for any help you can give me. I hope I'm just having a bout of extreme health anxiety but I can't think of anything else all day every day right now.",2021-01-28 13:34:25

I’m the the greater Toronto area and I’ve been suffering from some horrid form of IBS that ER docs have suggested might be IBD. 

My bloodwork and US/CT have been negative and I’m hopefully getting another endo/colonoscopy in the next few months (had one in mid-late 2019 which only found some irritation but nothing serious). 

Of course due to long wait time for public healthcare, my GI doc probably won’t be able to scope me for another few months (I have an appt with her this week).

I just thought I’d ask if anyone has had experience with good gastro clinics/programs in the province. 

I’ve heard that st michaels hospital in Toronto has a good inpatient and outpatient program for complex GI issues including IBS and IBD among other things.

They also consult emerg which is amazing, as the ERs I’ve gone through have not had that and literally shove me out the door as they don’t know what to do with me. I’m aware that ERs are for acute and not chronic issues, and at the same time I’m also suffering a lot of pain and it’s affecting my anorexia recovery too. I can barely work part time even, and my daily functioning is impacted and everything takes so much more effort. I get dehydrated so easily and my anti nausea/ pain meds just kind of scrape the surface of my issues. 

Any input or experience as to these programs? Wait times/ how to get in? 

I’m trying to get as much info as I can, I don’t want to go to a hospital emerg because a) chronic stuff so what can they do b) pandemic and c) I live about an hour away from the downtown Toronto core and it’s a lockdown and I don’t want to travel unless I really need to/put myself or others at risk).

hello fellow poopers!

Ive been struggling for a while and doctors are now trying to determine if I have ""just IBS"" (I hate that phrase because ibs can still be awful) or something more, like maybe crohns or some other IBD.

I've been doing  number of tests that either come back as ""normal"" or ""hey maybe that's Crohn's but not enough to diagnose"". Doc put me on prednisone while we are working on more tests (stupid pandemic taking forever) and I'm feeling hugely better, my main complaints are moderate-severe abdominal pain, constant nausea, basically no appetite and stool all over the place.

I also asked this on the ibs page, but was kind of wondering if the fact that steroids have helped so much points to IBD and not ""just IBS"". Do you guys have any thoughts? Doctor just keeps doing more tests and hasn't really given a diagnosis yet. 

Thanks!",2021-02-02 00:34:29

It first happened last January. I had about 3-4 in two weeks and the first 2 I had were really bad. Like I was going to go to the ER bad. My doctor suggested I try eating a more bland diet so I did. Bloodwork came back normal. It stopped but then happened again in August I think twice. Then again in October. Then again last night.

Thought it may have been a food allergy but I can't pinpoint to any specific food and I've already cut out the obvious ones.

So these attacks always happen about 4 or 5 hours after I go to bed, wake me up out of my sleep and last 3 hours. I can't seem to be comfortable in any position and it just really hurts. Its very crampy feeling. I also notice I burp a lot when these attacks happen. Lots of belching. Anyway all of this has led me to here...

I'm trying to narrow this down. Does it seem like IBD? IBS? Ulcer? Gallbladder? Also forgot to mention sometimes I feel a very mild burning pain in my abdomen but it'll be like for a second intermittently. 

Has anyone had H. Pylori? I can't ever seem to find a straight answer on what those symptoms feel like.

In the past, I’ve had to ultimately cancel scopes because I just couldn’t do it. Any time I have gotten through it, I’ve done it on a totally different timeline than instructed and just hoped for the best (meanwhile, I’m completely in tears and end up in significant pain from all the liquid).

And every time before now, I *started* in pretty good shape.

This time I’m starting off already nauseous to hell and vomiting, with severe bloating and very severe abdominal pain. I can barely choke back a few ounces of water every hour without intense pain and feeling like I’m going to vomit.

I tried expressing my concerns to my GI yesterday, and he said I didn’t have to drink as much this time. Doesn’t matter. It’s still 10x more than what I can currently get down right now.

Been trying to get back in touch with him all day but not hearing back. 

I don’t know a way of doing colon prep that doesn’t involve drinking way more than I currently can, but if anyone has any ideas I may not know about that I can bring up with my doctor, any insight would be appropriated. 

I desperately need this endoscopy/colonoscopy but I just cannot get through the prep this time around. I can’t do it. I’d rather water fast for a week than even try.

***Edit: I don’t think I made this clear enough before. I appreciate all the tips regarding taste, seriously, anything helps.***

***However, my overwhelming concern is the volume of liquid. After posting yesterday I tried to get a better feel of my limits and I could not get down even 16oz of ice cold water and then peppermint tea (my favorite drink) within even two hours when I was already *very* thirsty.***

***It caused unbearable bloating and pain to the point I even contemplated whether I needed to go to the hospital. I felt like my insides were going to rupture.***

***Does anyone know if enemas are ever an option? I’ve never had one, so if so, I would also appreciate hearing experiences about them - how bad is the bloat, cramping, etc?***",2021-02-02 20:29:10

I started having rectal bleeding and urgency at the beginning of December. My symptoms actually stopped one week ago. The doc basically told me my rectum is the only part that’s inflamed. All else looks good. My calprotectin score came back at 457. He wasn’t able to say whether I have Crohns colitis or UC. He said what I have is mild and can’t fit either diagnosis completely. 

What he wants to do now is have me take the smallest dosage possible of lialda (Mesalamine) one pill a day and some suppositories. Suppositories will be short term. He also said I can take antibiotics but it would just help a flare. He also said I could wait it out to see if my other stool test comes back as showing an infection but either way...I have both acute and chronic inflammation. 

I’ve always been a very healthy person and so against medications. I’m terrified and beyond worried about taking any meds. I’m trying to Process the fact that I’ll have to take meds for the rest of my life. 

I’m worried to take this med as I don’t want to suppress my immune system and be at risk for getting Covid, especially with the new strain. However, I also don’t want this to develop into cancer and want to keep this mild. 

I’m feel so defeated and down. Any thoughts about being on this med and being more at risk for Covid? Also...side effects seem to be minimal. Is that accurate? 

Is there something I can do to help my immune system with this med? I already take a vitamin D supplement .

Now I just need to vent, I'm so scared and worried for my partner and I guess telling you guys you might understand what he's going through and might be able to help me feel calmer about the situation.

He has lost 8kg since going into hospital 2 weeks ago, nearly 3, with severe ulcerative colitis. steroids alone didn't work, infusion of infliximab didn't work the first time, they gave him another infusion Monday and they're waiting to see if he will respond tomorrow or next day. In the meantime he is just wasting away, he's weak, they wanted to give him a food drip in his nose, he didn't want it so he's trying to eat as much as possible and they're giving him extra supplements. His heart rate is up. He looks so so sick. 

Surgery is an option that will become reality if this infusion doesn't work. We've discussed this (all through text/video because covid, no visitors) and he's ready for it, I mean as much as you can be. We did a pros and cons list. He'd prefer the surgery than another go at an infusion due to the toll it's taking on his body and the long term risks associated, I agree because then it will be done, he will be cured and he won't need to deal with this horrible disease again. 

He's only been sick since Christmas, and diagnosed 2 weeks ago with UC and will potentially get his colon removed and it'll all be over next week with a long recovery. Or miraculously this infusion will work and he will be treated with infusions and whatever else ongoing but be at high risk due to his compromised immune system. 

Has anyone here suffered very severe UC, and what was your outcome? Surgery or long termtreatment? Has anyone had the first infusion not work and got one the following week and it worked then??

At this point I feel nothing will work and he'll waste away to nothing before they finally take it out. Is there hope this second infusion will work?",2021-02-03 20:09:34

"" Microbes in our gut have evolved to generate beneficial microbial metabolites in the vicinity of the gut barrier,"" Jala said. ""However, this requires that we protect and harbor the appropriate gut microbiota and consume a healthy diet. This study shows that direct consumption of UroA or its analog can compensate for a lack of the specific bacteria responsible for production of UroA and continuous consumption of pomegranates and berries 

Haribabu Bodduluri, Ph.D., professor of microbiology and immunology at UofL and an author of the article, said another key finding of the research is that UroA and UAS03 show both therapeutic and protective effects. Administration of UroA/UAS03 after the development of colitis reverses the condition and administration prior to development of colitis prevents it from occurring.""

So Urolithin A is looking like a potential treatment for various types of IBD. There is also some interest in Urolithin A for anti-aging effects, so as a result there is already a supplement containing pure Urolithin A here:

[https://www.timelinenutrition.com/](https://www.timelinenutrition.com/)

Its certainly not cheap at $100 a month but not completely out of reach if it actually works.

Worth a shot perhaps. I am likely going to order some and try it. Minimum purchase is $200 for 2 months of supplement. Currently available in the USA only, but I am going to use [myus.com](https://myus.com) to have it shipped to the UK.

I looked into purchasing in bulk from china but its not really any cheaper than this right now. I expect the price will drop though as there is a buzz around this stuff for IBD and anti-aging.",2021-02-03 15:49:14

I first started with symptoms late 2017 (mainly bleeding that didn't go away at that time), and went to my GP. They ordered some tests, but the lab refused to run any tests on my stool sample 'because there was blood'....whilst I understand you can't do FIT tests with visible blood, there wasn't any obvious reason why any other tests couldn't be done. My GP was frustrated, and referred my to lower GI at the hospital for a colonoscopy....which they wouldn't perform because I didn't have the necessary tests in place to show I needed one! By that point my symptoms had died down, I had a quick rectal examination and they said I was all fine, nothing wrong.

Fast forward a year (ish) and I had symptoms again. As I'd been told I was ok by the hospital, I thought it must just be haemorrhoids and ignored it (I know, I should have got it checked). The symptoms went away after 2-3 months. Same thing happened again 6 months later.

Last October, I started having symptoms again, but things were a lot worse than before. In December I finally got the courage to go to the GP. They took me really seriously, and ordered loads of tests. The first set of bloods were 'lost' (i.e dropped) by the lab. Bloods came back all over the place, stool showed no infection, so more tests were ordered.

Next set of bloods the GP missed some off, so I had to go back twice in one day to get the missing ones taken - by this point I felt like a pin cushion! Calprotectin came back high at 1375, and I finally got a referral to lower GI as everyone I spoke to was saying based on the symptoms and all the tests it was very likely IBD (probably UC).

I had my call this morning, and I'm finally getting booked in for a colonoscopy! The call itself felt very rushed and was only 4 minutes long. I didn't get to talk about all my symptoms or ask some of the questions I wanted, but I'm hoping that discussion can take place more after the colonoscopy has taken place. I'm not hugely impressed with the hospital in general, but I know there's another one a bit further away that's amazing which I'm hoping I can switch to in the future (not sure how possible this is on the NHS).

This was longer than expected, so thanks for reading. :)

TL;DR - I'm finally getting a colonoscopy after 3 years of avoidable errors with tests and referrals. Looking forward to finally getting answers.",2021-02-03 12:22:44

I've only ever been on one biologic. My GI says that its unlikely something like Remicade would work because of where my Crohns is (terminal illeum and small bowel) and because its so similar to Humira which my body didn't respond to.

I'm honestly not sure what to do. The trials so far have shown good results, but its a trial and things can change, plus safety and maybe getting a placebo is a concern. But if I choose Stelara and it fails I'll need surgery, while if I fail the trial I can then try Stelara.

Are aches and soreness normal for regular IBD symptoms. The pain usually passes after 20 minutes or so but i am just so worried about everything as I am new to the disease and do not know what to expect. 

Currently i am not on any biologics and have recently just started taking B12, Magnesium, and Codfish liver oil supplements. Could these be causing the upset or discomfort?

More recently I have been having lots of mouth ulcers. The Dr has suggested I get tested for celiac and Chron's and I am very worried about the future.

I guess I was just hoping that someone can tell me its not so bad. Everything I read is sending me into panics. I love walking holidays and I am worried that I will have to give these up.

But I also think that maybe I am worrying over nothing. I rarely get diarrhea, but sometimes I do get unexplained diarrhea. I don't have cramps or abdominal pain and I have had no weight loss (weight gain actually).

I don't know, I just want someone to tell me it's fine.

They symptoms lasted a couple months then started to have very acute pain on my lower left side. They diagnosed me with diverticulitis. I followed up with my GI a week later, they ordered a CT and confirmed diverticulitis (thickening of my walls compared to a CT a couple years earlier).  They pain went from severe to moderate.  I had then had a upper endoscopy and colonoscopy.  They found gastritis and mild inflammation in my terminal ileum. No signs fo diverticulitis.

So I have been in remission for a few months and now I think I am starting a flare again. I am starting to experience symptoms again and definitely feeling abdominal pain. And what I hate most about this is having to tell my parents (I am a teenager). I am the first and only person in my family to have any type of illness. I have Ulcerative Colitis and have had several illnesses, diseases, or infections prior for basically my entire life while everyone else in my family is healthy (like my siblings literally have nothing and are perfectly healthy while I am always sick). So my family doesn’t actually know what it feels like or fully understand that its out of my control. I really don’t want to tell them that I am having symptoms because when I do they’ll start asking me what I did wrong as if it was my fault when it just randomly happens sometimes. On several occasions during my past flares I have heard “it’s because your too stressed”, “you probably ate something bad”, “why are you doing this to yourself” and my favorite “why do you want to be sick” as if it’s all my fault and my choice to start internally bleeding and feeling immense pain. They just don’t get it and it only makes me feel worse. They are aware and my doctors have said before that stress doesn’t cause IBD and that flares can just happen sometimes but for some reason they just can’t accept or fully understand that. Any sorry about the long rant but I just really needed to get this off my chest. Also, thank you for reading this",2021-02-14 23:13:13

I signed up here just for the purpose of posting this.

I've been dealing with IBD for most of my adult life. I have tried every diet modification imaginable with varying success - low fodmap seems to works ok. I also did carnivor for a bit and it actually worked great, just couldn't stick with it. Probiotics help a bit too, but nothing has been a cure. 

My usual symptoms are alternating diarrhea and constipation during flares, and steady chronic pain/bloating in my sigmoid colon. But worst of all - sticky poop. Honestly everything else I can live with, but man I hate the consistency of my shit. I haven't had a normal shit for around 7 years. I never feel empty. I can't properly empty my colon. Wiping takes forever. The toilet is never clean. Even when I do (rarely) have solid poop, it comes out malformed, small, curved. Not indicative of a healthy colon. It sucks.

Until two weeks ago.

For reasons completely unrelated to IBD I started taking Zinc citrate tablets a couple weeks ago and a single day into taking them I unexpectedly had the most glorious bowel movement I have had in the last decade. I mean a perfect 10/10, solid, well formed, girthy, not too wet not too dry, straight as a ruler, perfect A+ crap. For people who have normal bowels this probably means nothing, but for me this is a game changer. Immediately I tried a test, I stopped taking the Zinc, and waited for the next day. Just as before I was back to my usual loose sticky stools. So I tried the Zinc again. Boom, another perfect shit.

Over the last couple weeks I have now tested this on and off several times and like clockwork, I take the Zinc and my bowels revert to a healthy state I haven't experienced since I was a child. I really honestly cannot believe it. I have been living under the false assumption that I have a damaged sigmoid colon because of the shape of my shits, but now I see that it must have just been inflammation rather than the stricture I assumed. Unbelievable.

Now, it's not all sunshine and roses. The Zinc, for me, has had the side effect of some nausea and dizziness. This may just be dosage (50mg), or it may just be my body adapting. Regardless, I will continue to experiment because this is really a breakthrough for me. I would like to determine what exactly is happening. If it is something in the Zinc, or is it some response that my body is producing to the zinc. I don't know. All I know is that I take the zinc and my IBD is effectively gone.

I am interested as to whether anyone else here has encountered this for themselves, or whether anyone with deeper knowledge of minerals or nutrients might have an explanation as to what is happening here. I really feel like this is a turning point, and I want to find out as much as I can. Also if anyone has any feedback on the nausea and dizziness aspect let me know because if I can solve those I think I will be a new man.",2021-02-20 20:21:24

I have had ulcerative colitis since 2011 and am currently on Simponi (golimumab) every other week, Imurel (Azatioprin) 25mg and maximum dose of Mezavant (Mesalazin). 

The shot itself didn’t hurt at all for me, almost no pain in my arm at all, and I could hardly see where I got it. Approxiamtely two hours after the shot I got really hot and a bit tired. I had these hot flashes maybe four or five times during the work day, but they were over when I got home. I felt very tired, like my body was really heavy, but didn’t fall asleep very early that day.

On friday I woke up feeling fine, just a little tired and sleepy, but who isn’t at the end of the week. Told my colleagues I felt fine, but around ten I was proven wrong. Started getting joint pain and feeling off so I took some pain killers to get through the day. Felt warm and had to take off the t-shirt and tights I was wearing under my scrubs. 

Lunchtime came around, so I ate and the hot flashes came back and I felt ill, people commented that I didn’t look well, and one person told me I should go home and rest. Went to the bathroom and then suddenly felt a little sick, like I needed to vomit, but didn’t. Decided to go home. Was in bed by two and slept until half past four. Had a round of hot flashes again when eating and some joint pain and lower back pain late in the evening before going to bed. Took som pain killers for that.

Today I feel normal again. And very lucky to have gotten the vaccine. The next shot is in 9 weeks. I have been told that with the AstraZeneca vaccine most people have the worst side effects from the first shot contrary to the Pfizer vaccine where most people only got sick after shot number two. Out of 5 nurses at my department that got the vaccine on thursday only one didn’t have any side effects. The other three nurses got sicker than me, one was scheduled to come to work on friday, but didn’t.

The doctor that i go to is not in the state so i really dont know what should i do. I can easily get some antibiotics but i cannot eat them like candy like i used to before as they triggered my ibd after a heavy course. I know if i take them my ibd will get worse so i dont want to take them unless absolutely necessary. I am shitting 3-5 times a day. Any suggestions on what i should do as it seems to be getting worse day by day or should i just wait and see. I take mesalamine 2g sachet every day and a probiotic. Docs here dont give any test to test for infections they will just give you a ton of antibiotics. So what should i do? My ibd was never really this bad as i never had watery stools so consistently, thats why i have a feeling it is an infection but i cant say for sure. I am especially worried that i am letting whatever it is to get worse and is i wait any longer then it will be too late.

1006,Pregnancy and IBD,orbitingsatellite,20,lp3nee,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/lp3nee/pregnancy_and_ibd/,13,"Hello, long story incoming so please bear with me.

I’ve been having symptoms of an IBD for nearly 2 years now. When I first sought treatment 2 years ago, it was written off as IBS, but no testing was done. I simply would take Imodium to manage symptoms and hope for the best. It wasn’t until a year and a half later, when symptoms became much worse, that I sought treatment again. At this point, imodium was being taken nearly every day, sometimes twice a day, with barely any impact. Diets were attempted (FODMAP, no dairy, no gluten, etc) with no real changes. Also important to note, my brother had also recently been diagnosed with UC. 

My doctor, after doing sample testing, decides we should do colonoscopy. I felt so much relief after having lived with these untreated symptoms for so long. I was finally going to get some answers. I felt like having a real name for what I was dealing with would take the biggest weight off my shoulders. 

I did the colonoscopy prep 17 December. It was miserable and awful but I got through it knowing I wouldn’t likely have to do it again anytime soon and it would be worth it.

The next morning, 18 December I went in for the procedure. They asked me if there was any chance I could be pregnant. I said, it was possible I guess, I mean I am married... but I really didn’t think so. The nurses decide to do a test and wouldn’t you know it? It comes back positive. I’m pregnant... for the first time ever. They won’t do the procedure. I’m sent home.

My GI doctor says he won’t be doing anything with me unless an OB specifically signs off on it. 

My OB says that having UC while pregnant isn’t so bad, that a lot of people experience remission during pregnancy because the immune system is lowered. I feel pretty relieved and honestly, my symptoms had calmed down. 

However, as soon as I left the first trimester and entered the second, it’s like the symptoms just ramped up again with a vengeance. Except now when I take Imodium, I often have to take 2 to see anything, and then the next several days after I am severely constipated. They say constipation is a symptom of pregnancy but I only experience it now in the days after a flare when I take Imodium. Otherwise I am miserable with the same flare symptoms as pre-pregnancy.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has any experience with this? My GI said he’d be willing to do colonoscopy in second trimester, if my OB signed off on it, but she said she won’t and that it’s best to wait until after birth. I was excited to have a few months off from dealing with this, but I guess I was wrong. If you’ve read this far, thanks for listening.",2021-02-21 19:47:33

1008,Just need to vent,mirabelle7,13,loxk7e,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/loxk7e/just_need_to_vent/,2,"TLDR: Was mostly in remission for the past 8 years and started having symptoms again in June and am finding no solutions. Just aggravated. May be IBS and not IBD, tho.... 


I was diagnosed with IBD in 2012. Indeterminate at the time, but most likely UC. The first year was ROUGH. And I had a couple bad days here and there or at most, flares lasting 1-2 weeks since then but otherwise was mostly in remission doing very well for the most part. Then cue June 2020... not sure if it was the mix of the stress of losing my job, the pandemic, and general sh*ttiness of the world or what, but I started having diarrhea
and urgency. At first I thought it was just something I ate and figured it would pass in 1-2 days. A week tops. I am now going on EIGHT MONTHS of this BS - and have added frequent bowel incontinence to the mix. 

I had so many tests... they found mild inflammation at one point via colonoscopy. I did suppositories and enemas for a while and then had a stool test which apparently showed the inflammation was gone. None of the other tests showed anything. 

So, maybe these are IBS symptoms? (So maybe this is the wrong subreddit, sorry of that’s the case). Docs assumed I maybe had IBS and IBD at one point, but nothing much was ever determined or done about it so who knows... 

I was also tapering off anti-depressants at the time (starting in March-ish) when this started and thought this might be impacting my symptoms after reading that some GIs prescribe antidepressants for symptoms. So, I talked with my GI and PCP and started upping my dose again... and then again... and AGAIN... I was down to 2.5mg and 5mg on alternating days, and am now back up to 20mg/dah. This is HIGHER than I was at in June (10mg) (but not to my starting dosage, 30mg) - and I’m STILL having symptoms. 

I literally bought a cheap pack of a dozen pairs of underwear cuz I shit myself so frequently now.

This way if it’s really bad, I just throw them out instead of dealing with the mess...

I’m just so sick of it and don’t know what to do at this point. I’ve tried changing my diet in various ways (tho without even knowing what to try) no avail. Even have been caffeine-free for a couple of weeks now (after drinking 1-2 cups of coffee per day for the past 5 years or so) and tho it seemed to maybe help at first  - now I’m back to same ‘ol symptoms. The symptoms however are not even consistent. Sometimes all watery, sometimes partially formed... ugh.

I just miss the good ‘ol days when I had to use the bathroom a few times in the morning but then was good for the day. It was annoying at the time, but nothing like this... I’m still thankful I’m not as sick as I was when I was first diagnosed but man, I hope I don’t have to live the rest of my life like this. It’s exhausting.

Not to mention, I had been in a good routine of running every other day and hiking on average 5miles on non-running days when this started to hit. That was helping to keep me sane during isolation and now I only go out for short walks near my house in case I need to run to the bathroom. I’m just so tired of it...

Doc is now recommending I try something called Viberzi next... which I guess is for IBS (???) Not getting my hopes up tho. 

Thanks for listening if you got this far. I’m not really looking for recommendations, mostly just needed to vent. But, I suppose if you have any - I’m open to them.",2021-02-21 14:56:29

Past treatments: mesalamine, prednisone, humira, xeljanz. Current GI doesn’t believe in diet stuff but gave me info on low FODMAP. Going to start Stelara soon.

Sorta been having consistent symptoms for 2 years or so. After superbowl Sunday, I started to feel really bad. Went from 10 bathroom visits (only during the day) mostly to fart or sparingly to deposit solid stool to 20+ visits of diarrhea at all hours of the night, only allowing 2-4hrs sleep in short intervals, and feeling so exhausted all day I couldn’t work. 

I switched to low FODMAP like 2 weeks ago and I don’t fart anymore which has reduced the number of bathroom visits slightly and allowed me to sleep 6hrs consecutively (still wake up when it’s dark just to poo. But I still felt horrible so I sorta reduced it to rice, bananas, sweet potato, overcooked vegetables, and lean protein. 

Now I’m reading on here that maybe I should try SCD or IBD-AID and I’m interested. Someone said to try an all liquid diet to give my colon a rest. I would like to do that but I don’t know what that means exactly.

Like countless others, I am here looking for anyone who relate to my current story. 

About a month ago I had a large amount of bright red blood on my stool and in the toilet bowl, no pain or any other symptoms. I was immediately concerned of course but brushed it off as hemorrhoids, I already had an appointment coming up with my primary care so I decided to mention it when the time came. The week leading up to it I had blood in my stool with every BM. I let my Dr. know and he referred me to a GI. That took about 2 weeks and within those 2 weeks I had blood (less than the first time) and now mucus showing up, still with very BM. The blood stayed bright red and the mucus was white/yellowish. I spoke with the GI, told him about the blood and mucus everyday and his immediate decision was to do a colonoscopy which was perfectly okay with me. Within that week I have developed a small ache in my lower left quadrant, nothing debilitating, I’m perfectly able to conduct my daily routines to include exercise ,its just more of a noticeable thing. The last couple of days the blood has eased up a lot but still present, and there seems to be more mucus. 

Being military for 7 years the drug of choice is 800mg ibuprofen for musculoskeletal injuries, which I have taken consistently for quite a while. I have stopped taking it for about 2 weeks because it did not dawn on me until then that a potential side effect for long term use can be ulcers. With the blood easing up, I’m wondering if that had something to do with it. 

Either way, I have my colonoscopy on Wednesday so I’m sure ill be getting answers or something close to them just wanted to see if anyone could relate. Thanks!


**Update** Doc found inflammation from the anus to rectum. And inflammation at the cecum. So as he said proctitis UC and UC at the back or I guess front in the Cecum? Not too sure but he didn’t see it anywhere else.",2021-02-23 02:51:44

At this point I have no idea if I have IBD, but I'm desperate for answers and will hopefully know more soon. I would love to hear if anyone has been through anything similar. 

So, my story:

April 2020: blood and mucous in stools. No diarrhoea, more constipation than anything. See doctor. Blood and stool samples taken. All normal except high calprotectin (about 500).

May 2020: digital exam and ultrasound conducted. No abnormalities, put on mesalamine as gastro predicted proctitis (colonoscopy not possible due to me being pregnant and covid). Symptoms resolve quickly as soon as I started a mesalamine course.

November 2020: flexisig detected haemorrhoids but no sign of inflammation. Blood and mucous chalked up to haemorrhoids.

February 2021: calprotectin higher than ever (over 1000). Ongoing blood and mucous. Colonoscopy and endoscopy booked for next month.

My doctor's theory is either polyps, atypically presenting Crohn's, or some weird and whacky medical oddity with no known cause.

Overall I'm over it. I don't feel unwell thankfully, but I'm worried and pooping blood and mucous is pretty unpleasant. 

Thanks for letting me offload! Anyone been through a similar thing?

I've had issues most of my life and have felt so isolated, it means so much to know I'm not alone.
I'll try to make an exceedingly long story short. After struggling most of my juvenile/teen years with crippling stomach cramps and chronic diarrhea,  I was ""diagnosed"" with celiac disease because I got better on a gluten free diet, and had many of the weirder auto immune sides of the disease (mineral deposits on teeth, issues hearing, things of the sort) that made them feel it was celiac and not a sensitivity.
 I seemingly got better after a period of what I always thought was gut healing. Fast forward about  5 years and a baby later, I begin having cramping again and shit myself at work despite my diet and close attention to my triggers. I decide to seek more answers, and go to a gastroenterologist who performs and endoscopy/colonoscopy. He is unable to confirm my celiac disease because I did not want to eat gluten 2 weeks pre procedure. As much as I want a cinnamon roll, it would be hell and I know this so I am okay having ""presumed"" celiac. I was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic colitis (microscopic) and told basically if I'm flaring there is nothing I can really do besides have some pepto (which I cannot do right now because I am pregnant, and I'm flaring with crippling stomach pains, and I've had pain before but never to where it makes me vomit. Nothing comes up but small amounts of bile because it's past my stomach but the pain makes me retch which is new... ive even lost vision and blacked out for short times). 
After looking up this diagnosis online I can't help but feel like it misses the mark. The proof would be in my intestines I suppose, but is it possible that I was managing my IBD and presenting a healthy gut at the time of my procedure? I had not flared for months at the time of the scheduled procedure, actually it turns out I was very newly pregnant at the time and since then I have gotten so much worse (15 weeks in). With my first baby I had guts of steel, nothing bothered me (was on my gfree diet though of course). 
Thank you, thank you for reading this and giving it your thought. I'm just desperate to figure things out and I feel like so much is unexplained with the microscopic colitis diagnosis. I get mouthfuls of canker sores that come random flares, I've had the black stools and mucusy stools, I've been anemic my whole life to name a few. I feel like my doc kind of brushed a lot of my symptoms off as coincidence or maybe presumed celiac he can't prove without my poisoning myself first. I feel like he thinks I just get a belly ache here and there and take some pepto and ill be fine.. I'm just defeated... its a miserable way to have to live :(",2021-02-24 01:12:24

recently in the course of my normal blood work for hemochromatosis my iron levels had plummeted to anemia levels, hgb and hematocrit very low, and my hematologist was concerned that I might have internal bleeding somewhere. I have also had lower left abdominal pain since last July. a CT scan showed nothing, so my gastro ordered the endo/colonoscopy. the endoscopy looked normal, colonoscopy revealed some internal hemorrhoids, a 7mm polyp (removed) and 'congested mucosa in the sigmoid colon'

at my previous colonoscopy less than two years ago there were several polyps removed and one was pre-cancerous.

does any of this seem like UC/Crohn's? what will the biopsy show, if anything, to indicate if it is UC?

I believe that levels as high as mine are indicative of quite severe cases. So far my physical symptoms are fairly minimal - bms 2-3 times a day but all in the morning around breakfast, generally well formed but narrow. Lots of mucus and occasionally small amounts of blood. Recently some discomfort in my lower abdomen, but not severe and tends to go away when I am distracted.

Last time I posted I got lots of very supportive replies and I am so grateful. Right now I am hoping to hear from anyone whose first symptoms and test results were similar to mine. How have things worked out for you? What were you given by Dr's etc etc

I have yet to see a Dr face to face and so far have only had a ten minute phone conversation with my GP since my calprotectin came back. I am googling and my case seems severe, but I just don't know what to think.

Ok so

I had gone to an emergency clinic in my town for stomach pain last year. After some tests, I was referred to a GI Dr.

The GI doc had wanted me to do an MRI to see if I had IBD, as bloodwork showed evidence of me having it, but I couldn't do the MRI because the contrast they gave me was too much for my body to handle.

So my dr ordered a stool study (calprotectin i think), and that said I didn't have any markers for IBD. 

So I was told my symptoms are likely IBS

And I was like, okay cool its not IBD

Now months later, today I had stomach pain throughout the morning. I went to work thinking it was just gas, and that I'd be fine. I was also dealing with some constipation, but figured I could handle it.

Well, when I finally went to the bathroom a few hours into my shift, the pain was different, and wasn't coming from my stomach, but instead from my butt. I thought that was weird.

When I checked, my stool was bloody.

While I've noticed a bit of blood in my stool once or twice before today, this was different. There was a lot more blood, and it was lighter in color.

Previously, I've told my Dr when I had a tiny bit of blood, and she said it was probably due to toilet paper being rough or something. 

Now I'm worried that I actually DO have IBD, and that the dr just couldn't really tell without the MRI.

I don't know what to do.

I might try to go back to the clinic, despite having gone there yesterday for a different problem (that being my GERD was acting up really badly).

I'm super concerned though, and I just want answers.",2021-02-27 21:09:30

I’m on 2250/day Balsalazide and BACK on 5 mg prednisone for a while and 90% of what I eat is goop, but STILL lately almost every evening I suddenly get hideously nauseated.  I stand there trying to decide to eat something for dinner and I just start to cry because everything seems awful and I know that no matter whatever I eat, I’m about to feel really bad after I eat it. 

Tonight it was so bad to the point where I spent about an hour and a half just trying to force myself to choke down a bit of butternut squash soup which my boyfriend said tasted great but to me it tasted like it had gone off, then finally throwing that glop out and trying to choke down one mug of homemade chicken broth and one IBD-AID diet biscuit made with almond flour. It was all revolting and I got very upset sitting there just trying to swallow food and having it be nasty and unpleasant. 

Does anyone else get this?  Was there anything you were able to do about it?

I’ve also been seeing blood on the TP again for the first time since early September when I stopped crapping blood entirely after just two days on prednisone and I’m just very concerned about how I know if the medication is helping at all, or helping but not much, or if it’s just that this is the new normal and I can always expect to be nauseated, exhausted and have belly pain and still not be able to eat anything but broth and smoothies.

So I've been on remicade since I was like... 15 or 16. It helps tremendously, I have a lot of experience on it. That said, I tend to get pretty groggy immediately after the remicade, and then spacey for a few days after (sometimes mild sometimes really bad). 

I had my remicade yesterday and the spaciness hit me like a ton of bricks today, even though I felt alright the day before after I'd received it. Heart palpitations + tachycardia too, sorta like how I feel with dysautonomia when that gets bad. My stomach feels a little like how it feels when you're falling (if that makes sense?), too. 

I feel really unwell, enough so that I'm not even comfortable walking outside. My dysautonomia has been VERY good recently, so that's the only reason I'm not jumping to thinking it's just that. It also same on sorta suddenly/strongly, too. I technically had caffeine today, but it was only tea and I drink it most mornings without issue.

My name is Julia Beckel and I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Psychology Department at Colorado State University. I am currently working on my Master's thesis and need your help for my research!

I am currently recruiting participants for a study about the use of telework, also referred to as telecommuting, and worker wellbeing among workers with high-impact chronic health conditions and disabilities. High-impact chronic health conditions or disabilities may be considered a critical physical or physiological, intellectual, or psychiatric/psychological conditions that impact a person's day-to-day functional capacity. Such conditions include autoimmune disorders such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia or non-paralytic orthopedic conditions such as those which relate to chronic back pain, nervous system disorders such as chronic migraines or multiple sclerosis, gastrointestinal disorders such as Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders, as well as a variety of conditions as this list is *not* exhaustive.

If you are interested in participating in my study, you will complete a questionnaire with questions related to your teleworking habits, work characteristics, chronic health condition(s), and demographic information. For participating, you will be entered to win one of eight $25 Amazon gift cards. Your responses will be kept private. The survey should take approximately 30 minutes to complete, and may withdraw from the survey at any time

In addition, you may be identified as eligible for participation in a larger, multi-day study in which you will receive compensation. If you are eligible for participation in this secondary study, you will be contacted within 72 hours by me, the principal investigator.

I am relying heavily on electronic recruitment methods and word of mouth to disseminate my research; please feel free to share this post with anyone who may be eligible!

Ever since I've passed mucous with almost every bowel movement or had 'flare ups' with no blood, but they tire me out for weeks before hand, then I get even more smelly mucus, bad gas, bloating/cramps. It's happening again today which is why I'm writing this. 

The doctor told me to go to A&E and pretend I was in extreme pain to get a colonoscopy, but I couldn't bring myself to do that (although I was so bloated, I thought I was going to pop) and I thought if I told them my doctor wants me to have an emergency colonoscopy, they'd listen, but I got sent away. 

I've had a sigmoidoscopy (when I was coming out of a flare and there was very slight red dappled inflammation on the walls and the bowel was smooth, not ridged as normal) and a colonoscopy (when I had no symptoms so my bowel appeared normal). I've had calprotectin tests and too many fingers up my ass to count (they never believe me, or other doctors for that matter, when I say it's not blood from a fissure). I've been diagnosed previously with erythema nodosum and I have psoriasis. Seen two gastroenterologists. Provided samples. Nothing. 

I have almost all of the warning signs (except I rarely get diarrhoea but I have IBS-C so I'm constantly constipated and have been told I need laxatives more regularly), but I'm told they don't have all the answers, that it can't be IBD because it 'heals itself' and I come out of a flare on my own or that it's just severe IBS. 

I don't know what I'm missing here. Why do I get left to deal with this alone and without any answers?!

The doctors have repeatedly suggested and assumed it was a form of IBD, as have I, but there's always a missing link that they don't put together and I don't get anywhere. I honestly feel like they don't believe me at this point now, but I have at least one doctor who saw my bloody stool with her own eyes. 

I just want answers. I always thought an IBD diagnosis would be straightforward, especially after passing blood! I've even had unexplained bleeding from my bladder and no tests were done and it was found not to be an infection and antibodies did nothing to stop it. I was simply left with no further investigation.

Hi all, Can anyone provide insight on my recent results?

Last week I had IBD panel blood test which came back as such- Positive gASCA and positive ACCA, negative PANCA and ALCA. The notes say suggestive of Crohn’s disease with high risk of aggressive disease.

As well as a colonoscopy, I still had liquid bile in the colon and don’t know if I will have to repeat but the doc took biopsies from the colon (5 or so) and one from the Ileum. They all have come back as normal.

I’m meeting with the doc to discuss results next week but curious if anyone has seen anything similar? Abnormal blood test and a normal biopsy? I understand the blood test is diagnostic but it’s confusing and we didn’t have the IBD panel results going into the colonoscopy. Honestly the IBD panel was surprising because I consider my symptoms to be mild.

Also my calfecal test as well as my CRP test was normal. I do have high ESR and Rheumatoid factor numbers so there is inflammation somewhere. I’m nervous so any insight is appreciated.

So, I'm a 30 year old guy, who has been having GI symptoms for two months - changes in bowel movements (diarrhea and constipation, gas, burping, some pain here and there).

Did blood tests and everything came back normal except ferritin, which is high. Did an upper endoscopy and everything was clear as well. Celiac disease has also been excluded.

But now got my fecal calprotectin test results and they're extremely high - 2600! I'm quite stunned by this. I was expecting to be diagnosed with something like IBS, but this totally points towards IBD based on what I've been reading. There's definitely organic inflammation going on and appears to be massive.

Not gonna lie: I'm slightly scared. I know colonoscopy is next, for sure, and will either be IBD or cancer. Given my age, IBD is much more likely, but still... 

I was feeling really optimistic, because this flare started right after NYE and I'm finally feeling better this week, with a voracious appetite, less abdominal discomfort, less gas, etc. I thought the storm was over. But this test result has hit me like a truck, because my life is going to change quite abruptly, whatever the diagnosis. 

If it's IBD, the medication seems to be pretty fucked up. And then there's the likelihood of surgeries down the road, constant pain, etc. Cancer is not a fun option either. 

And I'm still intrigued by how mild my symptoms are compared to the calprotectin levels... Anyway, I'm really, really confused at the moment, will need a couple of days to process this, and my next medical appointment is still two weeks away.

Any tips are welcome. Thanks so much.",2021-03-11 17:39:33

For the last few years (possibly even longer) I’ve been having symptoms such as diarrhoea, mucus, bleeding, severe pain, fevers, nausea, lack of appetite, fatigue and occasional fainting (often in a bad ‘flare’). I was recently admitted to hospital as my gp was concerned. My mum has Crohn’s disease in her small bowel so my investigations were all for ibd. I had a very traumatic sigmoidoscopy as an inpatient and colonoscopy as an outpatient after finding high inflammation markers in my bloods and very elevated calprotectin even though it was 5 days after the ‘peak’ of the flare. 

Today I had an appointment with my consultant who said my colonoscopy and biopsy results were all completely normal. I’m having repeat bloods and stool sample done again which are in the lab now. 

We were all so so sure that I had crohns due to the inflammation, family history and having every single symptom. 

Is it possible for crohns to not show up on a colonoscopy? The colonoscopy only covered the large bowel and the opening to the small bowel. 

I’m feeling quite deflated now knowing that I’m no closer to having any answers or relief from my symptoms. I’ve got a follow up in two months but I can’t live like this for much longer. It’s left me housebound and often bed bound. In the last 24 hours I’ve opened my bowels 11 times surely that’s not normal.

I had severe GI symptoms 3 years ago. I had a sigmoidoscopy which found ""Subtle inflammation in sigmoid colon"", showed a picture of my colon looking blocked (inflamed), and had a faecal calprotectin test show levels over 3000.


Due to money issues I stopped going to my gastro 3 years ago as the symptoms lessened on their own and I was also finding all the tests traumatic. 


On my sigmoidoscopy report my old gastro wrote ""Diagnosis IBD"", but I don't know if that was a final diagnosis or a query diagnosis. 


I went to a new gastro today for the first time in 3 years because my symptoms have returned within the past couple of months. 


Here are where the issues begin. 


I had my old gastro send over my previous tests and reports (including colonoscopy, which showed nothing other than what the sigmoidoscopy showed, the subtle inflammation of my sigmood colon), and an MRI which showed nothing.


I have several symptoms which I think show it's not IBS. These are: weight loss, blood in stools, vomiting, waking up at night to use the toilet and waking up from pain, unintentional weight loss (this was 10kg over 2 and a half months). 


The doctor suggested IBS-D and I pointed out to him all of the ways which my symptoms do not point towards that and the fact that my old gastro queried IBD. 


He accused me of trying to ""diagnose myself"" and refused to acknowledge my concerns.


I also took photos of my stool as I believe it to look black and tarry and I was nervous it may be blood. I also took photos of mucus that I passed. I passed him my phone and he glanced at the screen without looking at the photos and didn't answer whether he thought it was blood.


He sent me away with a suggestion for probiotics.


I feel completely not listened to and like I was brushed off - am I overreacting or was he inappropriate?

The reason I don't call it diarrhea is because it isn't watery at all, it has a snake shape. It's just a very large volume of soft stool. I go once a day in the morning, it fills up the bowl in a big pile, sometimes above the water line, and it's crampy and uncomfortable on the way out and my pelvis hurts for about an hour afterwards.",2021-03-29 01:32:19

In 2019, I wrote/directed a short film called “Crohnie” starring UCB comedians Matt Besser and Pam Murphy.

We just launched a crowdfunding campaign allowing anyone to invest a minimum of $100 to help us raise our total budget. Check out the link below for more info!

[www.wefunder.com/crohnie](http://www.wefunder.com/crohnie)

We've partnered with over a dozen Crohn's & Colitis organizations to connect with this underrepresented community.

Personally, I've had such a wonderful experience hearing the inspiring stories from our supporters and I hope to portray all of our experiences authentically. At its core, “Crohnie” tells a universal story about self-acceptance. I’m sure that’s all something we can understand :)

Do you ever feel misdiagnosed?,Thiccclikehummus,18,mevnik,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/mevnik/grief_over_diagnosis_do_you_ever_feel_misdiagnosed/,19,"Has anyone else felt grief months after they were diagnosed? I was diagnosed with Crohns in November 2020 and at first, even though I was surprised by the diagnosis, I was relieved because I actually had an answer. I thought ‘great, my illness and pain isn’t in my head, I’m not a hypochondriac and I can get treated and I can move forward in life’. 
We are now here at almost April and I still feel like I’m working backwards. I have days where I don’t believe my diagnosis and wonder if I’ve been misdiagnosed (I’ve had colonoscopy/endoscopy with biopsies and an MRE). It’s not that I don’t believe it’s crohns necessarily but I don’t have the same symptoms as what Crohns typical represents as. (I don’t have frequent bowel movements, no blood etc) hell, I can’t even relate to the typical body type, I gained so much weight in the year before diagnosis because Of the extreme fatigue I had and because my liver was suffering so heavily. Besides I’ve had other things comes up which are so closely related to Crohns, like sacroilitis so logically it does make sense but I’m still finding it hard to even relate to my own diagnosis. 
I don’t even know where I’m going with this post but I’m just lost and confused by what my body can and won’t do anymore. I’ve been on  prednisone for months now, which is making me unhinged I think and I am desperate to get off it because it’s made me not recognise myself in the mirror either (major moon face and stretch marks from my skin thinning). 
I’m talking to my Gastroenterologist tomorrow, last time he spoke he said he would start me on Imuran but wanted to keep me on 25mg pred (down from 40mg) for a few more weeks, but I got desperate and have tapered down to 17.5mg cause I want off. I’m worried about Imuran but I am just so desperate to feel normal. I still don’t even fully understand what remission IS for IBD or what I can ever expect. I’m 28 and my body and lifestyle isn’t reflective of that at all anymore and it makes me so so sad. Especially because I don’t feel like, compared to some of you lovely folk i see in this sub and the Crohns sub because they’re disease is clearly so much worse, I feel like I should just feel happy I’m not in need of surgery right now? Can anyone else relate to this feeling or is this the Prednisone talking?",2021-03-28 07:57:01

I don’t see why I need another when it’s been a year since my last one. I’m diagnosed with microscopic colitis and have a second autoimmune condition that can cause GI ulcers. I can’t take biologic drugs anymore, so I feel sort of limited. I have about a week of relief around infusions I get for my autoimmune disorder but the fear of the month is a mess. 

Is Budesinide usually just used short term? I’m calling GI I’m just not thrilled about them wanting another scope. I’ve had SIX in the past 14 years.

1128,Had bad inflammation/secondary? appendicitis about 2 months ago. Curious about what you guys think and if anybody has had this happen.,MahDang,9,meu7fg,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/meu7fg/had_bad_inflammationsecondary_appendicitis_about/,2,"Hi all. I want to preface this with saying i'm 22 turning 23 in august and am male. I would also like to apologize for my english if it turns out hard to read. It's hard to grammar correctly when things are on your mind.

I discovered this sub when I was prepping for my colonoscopy (i liked the procedure more than the prep tbh). Prior to my admission to the hospital I had by far the worst pain in my entire life in my lower abdomen. Finally after about 4 days I decided to get a CAT scan and they found appendicitis which I was then referred immediately to the emergency room.

While waiting in ER and given pain meds the surgeon went over my symptoms (symptoms was constipation extreme bloating, and severe pain when urinating.) and was suspicious that it wasn't mainly appendicitis and there might be an underlying cause to my appendicitis. He thought it might be chrons and was taken off pain meds and was switched to antibiotics to get the swelling down, and was further admitted to a room to spend the weekend in the hospital and was scheduled for a colonoscopy.

Fast forward 2 days in the early morning I was given the news that ""all i had was colitis which is good news"". So given as I have never heard of that before, I do the dumbest thing ever: Look it up on the internet.

All i saw was info upon info about UC and chrons and the complications and the nightmares and so on. Let me tell you i've never felt so damn stressed before and broke down in tears.

Fast forward to my follow up with my general doctor, I was told that all I had was colitis. Asked what could cause it, was told stress, something i ate, etc etc. So based on this diagnosis there's nothing online or really any more info my doc can give me about ""simple"" colitis.

I'm curious about what you guys think. I would like to say that my grandpa had something like this happen to him only once about 60 years ago and has since had no issues, so maybe it's genetic? I'm thinking about calling the GI who did my procedure and getting more info, but what my main doc told me was from the GI's notes.

The only meds i was told to take after i was discharged was anti biotics. that's it. I have since had no ""flares"" except when I ordered wendy's spicy nuggets which are soooo good but god did i have fiery poops and pain again.

I have since been on a low fat diet and have on and off been going on walks and doing some jump rope here or there.
If i can provide more info please let me know. :)

EDIT: I would like to acknowledge that my inflammation was in one small part and was biopsied. Seemed to come back clear, but will call GI to see what he says about it next week.",2021-03-28 06:11:07

I've been having a lot of symptoms that my doctor was pretty certain was Crohn's. However, they've been unable to officially diagnose me and I was wondering if anyone knew conditions that were similar to Crohn's that might  be worth bringing up to the doctor. 

My main symptom is localized abdominal pain on my right side (always in the same spot) that gets significantly worse after eating. I also get a lot of bloating, frequent nausea (rarely actually vomit), stools frequent and kind of all over the place in terms of consistency. They've done a whole bunch of tests that either come back as ""Maybe it's Crohn's"" or normal, including MRIs, CT, pill cam, did a balloon endoscopy to get farther in my small intestine than the regular one.   Also prednisone helps a huge amount with my symptoms, which is why the doctor is so convinced that it is Crohn's. 

&#x200B;

I'm really having troubles with getting diagnosed. In September, the doctor said that they would do some test and he thought we'd have a diagnosis in 2 months, well it's been 6 and I fell like we are still at square 1. They just keep doing more tests and I'm very sick of being sick.

Growing up, my wife was always told by her mother and health professionals there was nothing more to be done and she'd have to live with the pain of burning skin and stomach acid. She would go through a whole box of bags in a day when it got really bad. 

Last week she met a new stoma-care nurse who recommended something as simple as a belt attachment. She's been almost pain free for a week and her skin is finally having a chance to heal.

Before all this, I googled stoma care products that would help her out and things like barrier sprays, adhesive removing wipes etc seemed to help. She never knew these things existed and never thought to look because everyone around her told her there was nothing out there that would help. 

And then suddenly the suggestion of a simple belt works wonders for her.

I'm angry for her. Angry at the specialist stoma nurses and bowel surgeons who told her for years there was nothing else that could be done.

My wife has been unable to work as an adult, but she now has an opportunity to do these things, and be able to drive her car for longer periods and walk around town unaided.

Really sucks for those of us in Canada and other places where second doses are being delayed. Government policy cannot move fast enough to keep up with the new data coming out everyday. If you're on infliximab, do not count on a first dose of the vaccine to protect you.

I asked my Colon and rectal surgeon if I should do a colonoscopy and he said “no, your fissures are normal and don’t show any signs that they are caused by IBD.” I’m just wondering if anyone here has had anterior and posterior fissures be basically their main symptom. I have been having health problems lately but I have pretty bad depression and anxiety, so I don’t have a healthy lifestyle. I don’t have abdominal pain or urgency. I do have severe dry eye though. But my GI said that even though IBD can cause eye issues, my eye issue is not related to that. My concern about the colonoscopy is that it will put my fissure through an immense amount of pain. I’ve had diarrhea a couple times and have been bed ridden because of the fissure pain. So I know the prep would be hell",2021-04-01 00:37:41

Blood in my stool last week for a couple of days which has never happened before, and I'm coming down (thank god) from that flare. Aside from abdominal pain, I had zero other symptoms.

Urgent care found colitis in my lower colon but all other blood and urine tests were clear.

My doctor couldn't get me in until April13th and even asked if I'd like to do a virtual appointment, so I'm a little discouraged that it sounds like I won't get any answers that day. She refused to do a scope while I was flaring because she assumed I was infectious (despite the doc at urgent care specifically stating nothing at all indicated I had any sort of infection) Certainly can't do any tests over Zoom.

If my flare is on its way out, isn't there a much lower chance that they can catch anything happening by the time I get in? I had a colonoscopy a year ago that came out clear, but clearly something else is happening now, right? And what are the next tests they'll run if not just that? I've pooped in that hat thing many times in the past, and don't know the names of the tests that I sent in, but they never show anything. So it is just always back to IBS.

I've tried asking the GI doc's care team these questions but as nice as they are, they are pretty bad at playing messenger, and they get back to me with vague or unclear answers from my (very busy but very popular because she's so good) doctor.

EDIT: I checked and it looks like they did the following tests at the end of 2020, all clear:

\- Fat, Fecal Qualitative (Sudan Stain)

\- Ova and Parasites (Comp Parasite Exam)

\- Giardia Antigen, Stool

I've been a long-time lurker and I'm finally getting the courage to post something. I have been suffering from IBS symptoms for about four years now, and have recently entered a flare-up of symptoms that I can't totally shake. I'm close to 28 years old, male, otherwise healthy besides these gut issues. I mainly have diarrhea and abdominal cramping. I have good days/weeks and periods of bad days in between. I usually feel some sort of GI discomfort, but 

Okay, now for the history. About 3 and a half years ago, I had my first colonoscopy that came back negative for any sort of issue. A few months later after changing GI doctors, I got an abdominal CT done that also came back negative. Bloodwork and stool tests were normal as well. About 9 months after that (2 .5 years ago from today), I had a barium X-ray and then completed the PillCam procedure. Everything came back just fine. My GI docs reassured me that it was IBS, and that I needed to work on reducing my stress and improving my lifestyle. I worked on myself, and I improved for about 9 months. I was a new person. Things trended backward in 2020 by a large margin (because you know, 2020), but I kept moving forward. I got prescribed an antibiotic for a skin issue and things went downhill from there.

Fast forward to a month ago when started noticing a lot of nausea and diarrhea while having some bowel movements, kind of like having a stomach bug but once every 3 or 4 days. This progressively got worse to the point of it returning almost every day. Last Thursday was the worst, with a total of 14 bowel movements, cramps, mucus, and a trip to urgent care. Everything came back negative, except for a small amount of blood in my stool. This has me concerned, but I went a lot that day and I've never physically seen any blood in the past four years. Since then, my bowel movements have lessened back down to about 2 a day (with the addition of Florastor), but I'm still dealing with the residual cramping and abdominal pain. I am feeling quite a bit better for now.

I'm trying not to freak myself out and hoping for the best, but I just can't shake the thought that I could have some sort of IBD. I have seen a ton of posts where people get the full testing workup done, come back negative multiple times, then turn positive for IBD years later. What are everyone's thoughts? Am I overthinking this and just need to ride it out? **I am seeing my GI specialist this Thursday to get their input and to push for some testing.** I will post more when I know more.

I've been lurking here while working with my doctors. I'm curious about your experiences losing weight during a flare up or pre-diagnosis.  

When you've lost weight you attribute to IBD, do you:  
\- still eat a normal level of calories but see weight loss anyway (likely due to nutrient loss/malabsorption/increased functions to replace things like lost blood or lower inflamation?)  
\- avoid some foods to limit symptoms so fewer calories = weight loss   
\- lack of appetite/constant nausea/feel full all the time so you eat less than normal = weight loss  
\- other?

Anyway, I was diagnosed with proctitis in 2018. That is still technically my official diagnosis (but it has definitely progressed up my colon due to how I'm currently feeling). I have been in a flare for 9 months now and have gone through 6 different meds. Some helped a little for maybe a week, and others didn't help at all. Prednisone, lialda, rowasa, uceris, mesalamine suppositories and now Xeljanz XR, which I now know is the completely wrong medication I need to be taking. 

Anyway, the past 2 months have been literal hell for me. Constant stomach pain/cramps and gas, bloody diarrhea anywhere from 8-15x daily and I have lost over 10 lbs. Have seen 3 different incompetent doctors who have yet to be able to help me. I haven't had a fever, chills or vomit. Though I do feel nauseated when my stomach is hurting, which is most of the day.

My 13 year old son was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in September, following a hospital admission due to a flare up. He was sent home with 8x 5mg prednisolone which was gradually reduced as he became better. He was also prescribed mesalazine (1g), 2 tablets in the morning and 1 in the evening, with an enema at night.Since then, he continued taking mesalazine in the same way. Recently, he has had a new flare up and his dose has been increased. His blood test results were CRP 28 and Hb 115. His fecal calprotectin level was high. Before this flare up, he became quite sedentary due to lockdown and his interest in computer games and his phone. It is very challenging to encourage him to eat healthily and it has emerged since the current flare up that he has not been taking his medication (enema) properly. I noticed that he improved when he was attending school during the first flare up. 

Today, we visited his doctor and he recommends to start steroids again, and then to prescribe Azathioprine. I am very concerned about this due to his age and the possible side effects including cancer. I think it might be best for him to go back to school (in 1 week’s time) without steroids to see if there is any improvement. He could try steroids again if necessary.  
I am also concerned that I could be wrong, as this is contrary to the Doctor’s recommendation. I feel that he has improved a bit and he has not had much weight loss. As this is his second flare up, I worry that prescribing Azathioprine could be premature.

I’m going to doctors constantly and all of them are like “well that’s unusual!” I’m not handling it well.

I don’t know what’s going on with me but I keep getting worse. It started 3 or 4 years ago. It may have started before that and I was missing signs or maybe it just hit me all at once. Back then it was colitis, but unspecified, maybe an IBD, maybe not. I took mesalamine for several months without a specific diagnosis. I recovered or maybe I didn’t really recover exactly, but I was better. The doctors didn’t recommend further medication unless something changed and I was ok mostly for a couple of years.

But then I started getting worse in a different way. 

In September 2020 I went 4 days with no sleep and then was prescribed lexapro and klonopin for anxiety and panic attacks. Wisdom tooth out in November followed by some antibiotics. December I started getting bad muscle and joint pain, like a burning sensation, which got worse after upping lexapro dose, so I decided to come off all together and was put on gabapentin for the burning pain. January had SSRI discontinuation symptoms. February I started having more persistent nausea and bloating that intensified over the month. 

Throughout all this time, I had mild nausea here and there or stretches of days where I had little appetite. My doctors thought it was anxiety and so did I.

But then the abdominal pain started again like it had years ago.

In March, I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy, diagnosed with reactive erosive gastritis and put on prilosec. Felt a little better but then less so. During my follow up, my doctor said they found elevated eosinophils in my colon biopsy despite there being no inflammation. Along with my primary care doctor, they decided to put me on a low dose of prednisone for a week. 

That brings us to the end of March and beginning of April and I started feeling worse. I asked about the medications but they said it’s short term and to give it a try. On the last day of the prednisone, I had a fever and watery diarrhea, and I normally do not have diarrhea. The fever and diarrhea lasted 3 days. I was covid tested and it was negative. I had my first shot 2 weeks ago too, if that would have mattered. 

I had made an appointment with a new gastro doctor for a second opinion or maybe as my new doctor and he wants me to try budesonide. He also thinks I’m a mystery at the moment.

I am constantly in pain throughout my body. I don’t know what to eat and am rapidly losing weight, especially over this last week. My diet was already limited before the gastritis and even more after. At least before this past week, I was eating something, but I’m barely eating anything now. The nausea is getting to be constant and intense but I’m not vomiting. I don’t know if vomiting would be better? The pain is showing up in new spots. Maybe it was bad timing and I got food poisoning or something, but it’s not like whatever happened to me happened without all of the other problems cascading down.

I am terrified of all these medications because they don’t seem to do anything for me and then I worry they are actually harming me. I know I am being paranoid, but I’m too weak physically and emotionally to fight those thoughts right now. Or I’m not being paranoid and something I’m ingesting is causing an allergy and that’s my problem because that has been suggested. 

Food allergy, medication reaction, autoimmune, infection. Or something else? Is there anything else? 

I know I could be worse, but I feel so lost. 

Mostly I’m scared that I haven’t hit the bottom yet. 

I have a 3 year old and feel like a terrible father because I can’t play with her like I had even a few weeks ago. I’m scared of being alone with her because I’m worried about not being able to take care of her. I feel like a terrible husband because of the burden I am putting on my wife to take care of our child and now me. 

I know a lot of this isn’t healthy thinking. I am in therapy and do meditation. I try to be active when I can, but lately it’s hard. 

I am looking for answers as to what is happening to me, not necessarily from here though. Just needed to vent maybe. 

If you do have any thoughts or ideas on how to manage the pain and nausea or better ways at handling the stress of not knowing what is going on with your body, I’d love to hear that though. Any kind word will do really.

So I hardly ever have any type of stomach pain, no cramping, never overly gassy, nothing. However, about 2 weeks ago I went to the bathroom and there was lots of blood in the toilet afterwards. I went to the hospital because it scared the life out of me, they did a check for external and internal hemorrhoids or fissures and said they didn’t find any of either. They told me it seems like it might be chrons or ulcerative colitis and that I need a colonoscopy, although they did not mention either thing until I brought up the fact that I have an autoimmune disease (hashimotos). Since then I have not had any problems, no pain no bleeding nothing. I have noticed a change in my bowel movements though, I’m going less, it’s softer than normal, paler than normal and thinner than normal. I haven’t been eating normal though, I’ve only been eating chicken and skinless potatoes basically because I’m scared it will happen again. I quit drinking pop, coffee, and a lot of other things. So does this sound like I could have chrons or UC? Or does it sound more like something that happened once from something bad I ate or something like that?

To be clear, she doesn't have an IBD diagnosis but I'm wondering if I should be pushing doctors harder to rule it out? And if so, how best to do that?

My daughter is 5 years old and for over 18 months now has been having a set of significant bowel issues. She has been urgently pooping between 8-15 times a day, often watery and mucousy, and rarely but occasionally with blood. I contacted our GP a year ago who did a calprotectin test which came back a little high but not overly alarming (90ug/g). She has tummy pain frequently, ranging from mild to severe. These symptoms tend to appear for a few months, then ease for a few months, then come back again.

We were referred to a gastro consultant who was really unhelpful. He diagnosed her over the phone as constipated and said he wouldn't treat her until we tried laxatives for 3 months. After 2 weeks of movicol, she was pooping 30 times a day, with lots of blood and had lost a 6th of her body weight. I asked about Crohns then, as she has regular mouth ulcers and joint pain but was dismissed saying she would have lost even more weight than she already had (she was underweight). The consultant then diagnosed her as gluten intolerant, which dieticians have since refuted. We have also tried to remove dairy, which didn't help either.

After lots of nagging on my behalf the consultant performed an ultrasound to check for bowel thickening which apparently didn't show anything out of the ordinary. As they have done this the consultant is refusing to run any more tests and has suggested it is just toddler diarrhoea. From your experience, is an ultrasound indicative enough enough to let this lie? 

I understand nobody on the Internet can give me an armchair diagnosis but I'm very interested to hear about other experiences around this process. I hate seeing my little girl so poorly and am frustrated that it seems like they won't examine her properly because she's a child. She is missing so much school as a result of her issues!",2021-04-14 14:57:18

First time poster here. I have been having blood on my stools for about 5 months. It gradually increased in quantity, and eventually progressed to passing only bloody mucus. For the past few weeks, there is blood streaked on my stool, I will have urgency to go a few times a day (usually after meals), and pass only this orangey pink bloody mucus material. Sometimes there is a lot of bright red blood on the toilet paper. Stools are somewhat well formed, I don’t really have diarrhea.

I had an alarming amount of blood and mucus 2 days ago, so I went to ER. The doctor looked inside with a little scope and said that I appear to have Proctitis and could tell on visual exam that the tissue is fragile and was bleeding there easily. There was blood on the gauze I cleaned myself up with after the exam so one thing that settled my mind slightly was that we could see easily where the blood is coming from. 

I had a blood test also and my Hemoglobin was normal. My WBC was also normal so she felt that don’t have Infectious proctitis. She referred me to another doctor within the hospital that does colonoscopies. Hopefully the colonoscopy will happen sometime next week and I will have answers. I was discharged with no prescriptions, and now have extreme anxiety about what’s to come. 

I am scared to death. I’ve never had any major digestive issues before. I’ve had episodes of small amounts of blood on stool in the past, and that would clear up within a few days. The longest was a month, but there was no issue with passing mucus etc at the time. My family doctor attributed these to hemorrhoids, which the ER doctor said she didnt see any on exam. If I have Proctitis, I do understand that it is IBD only affecting the rectum and can/will spread. I’m also very afraid that I have colon cancer and am only 32 years old :(

Can anyone shed some light to help settle me down a little before the colonoscopy? I’m not asking for medical advice, but I am in a very frightened headspace and don’t have a lot of emotional support right now. I’m preparing for the worst but hoping for the best.",2021-04-16 14:52:06

Got my UC diagnosis in  January and been on rectal mesalamine since then - been fine but illness didn't quite clear up and symptoms started to coast between ""not as bad as pre diagnosis"" but ""not in remission yet"". So the docs put me on Mesavant XL as well, which I started last week.

Now for the last five days I've been battling one of the worst flu-like illnesses of my life.  basically extreme tiredness, fever, slight cough, vomiting, shivers, trouble regulating temperature, occasional palpitations. In these times I thought, maybe covid or the flu, but covid test came back negative.

I stopped taking the med yesterday after rereading the leaflet that says ""if you get these symptoms stop taking the medicine, idiot"", and all of a sudden I feel a whole bunch better - got some actual sleep and most symptoms gone away. 

Just wondering if anyone has had anything close to this kind of reaction before to Mesavant or other mesalazine meds?

I have the wonderful combination of chronic kidney stones and microscopic colitis. Well, they weaned me off of oral entocort a few weeks ago and it didn’t take long for my gut to revolt. I went from diarrhea to constipation, to just flat out totally unpredictable...and painful. My cramps are out of this world. They started to radiate straight through to my back. Now after a bowel movement my back throbs and the pain is so intense I literally see black spots. 

Last night I’m fairly sure I passed a kidney stone. Thanks to experience and a keen eye, I’m 99% sure. Since I haven’t had a bowel movement today I haven’t gotten to see if the back pain fully returns with that. I do have throbbing pain but that’s not unusual post kidney stone. I’m just not sure where one starts and the other begins.

I’m trying to make plans as my colon and kidneys laugh maniacally at me. If it’s not a common issue in my fellow colitis folks then I’m fairly comfortable knowing it’ll improve. If it is a common issue then I’m in for a fight with my GI doctor. They want another scope. I’ve had six. I just turned 35. I know some people get them annually and I applaud you all. I get so sick with the prep that I’ve ended up admitted to the hospital twice.

Was put on an IV fluid rotation and sent home the next afternoon with strong antibiotics.

Booked in and had a colonoscopy within 2 weeks for a follow up as I have 2 close family members who have had bowel cancer early in life (30s and 40s). 

Colonoscopy found a few precancerous polyps they removed and specalist noted that their was slight Inflammation in the sigmoid region but put it down to the bout of ""food poisoning"".

Spent 2020 realtivey okay - Always put down my off days to bad food choices / stress and drinking on weekends seemed to ""throw off my bowel movements"" for a few days afterwards.

Mid 2020 (August) my regular bowel movements went from 6am every morning with no issues to completely random bouts of constipation and diarrhea. Sometimes I would be backed up and bloated for 2-4 days and then spend 3 hours on the toilet in extreme pain, sweating, naked and praying to whatever entity in the universe to make it stop. 

This continued to get worse and worse and I would start near consistent days of diarrhea - 3 to 6 times a day running to the toilet and spraying liquid fire no matter what I ate. This prompted me to stop smoking cigarettes, stop drinking alcohol and put a lot of effort into cleaning up my diet. 

No matter what changes I made to my diet (high protein, low carb, keto, low fodmap etc) my symptoms just got worse accompanied with increasing low sleep quality and fatigue. 

My joints started to ache, my muscles felt like I was training for a strongman competition and workouts dropped from the usual 30-45 minute weight sessions to 15 minutes a few times a week. 

Anxiety and depression started to go through the roof but I was determined to work with my GP and find out what was happening. We ran every allergy test possible and and Inflammation markers came back fine - Turns out I was allergic to seafood so I completely removed that from my diet. 

I ended up in ER on Xmas Eve as I was passing a lot of blood in my stool and had had enough of the pain, fatigue and diarrhea daily. They gave me a 5mg endone (oxycodone) - Said I probably have hemaroids and sent me home that day. 

It's now early January 2021 and I've lost 11 KG since August of 2020 and my symptoms are constant pain in the sigmoid region, daily diarrhea and blood with every 2nd or 3rd stool. My GP sends me back to the ER and I receive the same treatment - Opiate based pain relief and sent home with a small script for tramadol. 

I follow up my GP to book me in for another colonoscopy the 2nd week of January 2021 - I am told due to my age (29) that I am on Triage level 3 and would be looking at getting the procedure done around November / December 2021 (hopefully). 

Over the course of the last few months February until now my quality of life has dropped to 0 - I haven't left my house apart from seeing my GP, going to the chemist to get scripts for anti anxiety medication and each day is filled will bloating, nausea, radiating to extreme pain in my lower abdomen followed by diarrhea and blood. 

I took it upon myself to see a second GP who after looking through my record immediately called the hospital I was booked in for and demanded I would be moved to a better triage number and be seen earlier. The hospital had not even known I was in the system. 

After 3 follow ups with the gastroenterology section of my hospital I am happy to say they moved me forward and I was able to see a Specialist last week. His opinion is that I am suffering from a mix of slight IBS and anxiety which is causing all my problems. 

I am now booked in for an endoscopy and colonoscopy in 4 weeks and hope to finally get an answer on what is happening to me. 

It's been a draining process, I've eaten through all my savings and lost a few business opportunities as I have been living between my bed and my toilet on 3-5 hours of sleep a night for over 6 months now. 

Just thought I'd write this all down as it's such an invisible disease and being told it's all in my head and to ""try and rest and relax"" really doesn't help anymore. 

Hopefully I can update this with some positive news of a diagnosis and get on some medication to start my process of recovery. 

Please if you feel your current GP isn't doing enough / taking you seriously go and get a second opinion - It may just save your life and sanity.

I was diagnosed with IBD back in 2017, it was a little bit of a wild ride but after being sent to the hospital for drinking 10 litres of water a day and extreme diarrhea and the other usuals. As I was paying privately (I’m in the UK) they did a colonoscopy within a week and the biopsies came back with high inflammation. Ive been on a range of drugs since then but steroids/aza/mezavant mostly. 

During the pandemic I got a bit fed up and went off my medication it was a mixture of being scared of being immunosuppressed and depression. Spoke to my consultant today for the first time in a year (on the NHS now so thats why its been so long) and a half and naturally got a bit of a row off him because I’ve been symptomatic recently. Not as bad as before but feeling more like a 70 year old again than a 28 year old 🤣. Hes instructed me back on the meds which I will adhere to, I’ll behave from now on.

In a few weeks he wants to do another fecal test firstly to see if the calprotectin is increased. My question is I want to do everything to make sure this isn’t increased has anyone got any tips of what to avoid? Other than going back on meds.

My daughter was diagnosed with indeterminate IBD in February, although they are leaning toward UC. She started Remicade and quickly developed pancreatitis. It cleared up, and they dosed her with Remicade again, and she again developed pancreatitis. This basically meant Humira was also off the table as it's too similar. So on Monday she started Entyvio, and now we're in the hospital again (I feel like we live here) with what is either pancreatitis again, or some horrible side effect of Entyvio causing crippling stomach pain where there previously was none. 

So...dr. mentioned that if it's pancreatitis again, it may be that this is how her body reacts to biologics and that they are not an option. However, her case is considered severe and it doesn't sound like it will respond to mesalamine, 6MP, etc. So...what's left? If every biologic gives her pancreatitis, and the other meds aren't strong enough, and she obviously can't stay on prednisone forever, then what? 

I am frustrated, sad, angry, and cannot stop crying. Seeing my 12-year-old laying on the bed crying in pain is literally going to emotionally wreck me.

My symptoms always worsen before a test, any tips?

Hi Reddit, I’m 18F with UC (diagnosed at 14) and I’m in my last year of high school in the Netherlands, so I will have to take my last exams in a month. I was wondering if you guys had some tips for coping with the stress related symptoms.

(This is the first time I’ve posted something on Reddit so I’m sorry in advance if I’ve made any mistakes. I will also post this on r/UlcerativeColitis.)

First some background information: I was in remission for almost a year, but then the Humira stopped working. So I’ve been in a flare-up since mid-january, but I’m doing okay right now on prednisone (tomorrow my last week will start with 5 mg, tapering off from 40 mg in the course of 8 weeks). I have also had my first Stelara infusion in March and will have my next injection in 3 weeks.

Now my problem: Whenever I have an important test, I have noticed that my symptoms worsen in the morning. I am in pain on the toilet the whole morning, very uncomfortable and/or in pain during the exam, but most of the time it lessens when I get back home. 

Even though I get up really early so that I can take my time and go to the toilet, I always get urgency right before I need to leave. I always know that I will be in a lot of pain because of this during my tests. 

I know that this has to do with the stress of having to go somewhere / having to take an exam, but I am not particularly nervous for the exams themselves. My grades are good and I know I only really need to show up and sit there for three hours to graduate. I will have one or two three-hour exams a day for two weeks.

Now I am going to take these exams, if I am in pain or not, because I am not gonna let this disease stop me from getting my diploma. I really don’t want to fail and do the year all over again just because I wasn’t able to go to the exams.

I was wondering if anyone had any tips for dealing with these symptoms that occur every morning I have something important coming up. Have you experienced something similar and how do you deal with it?

So my symptoms story stared when I got infectious mononucleosis in December and I was sick for a few months and then got better. I thought everything was going to be okay but then mono like symptoms came back. At that time I stared feeling weirdly tired and had foggy brain a bit of blurred vision and my eyes were a bit glossy ( some veins popping).I also stared feeling this globus sensation in my throat and had a uncomfort swallowing I also felt mucus at the back of my throat + some minor digestive problems.  I went to see my doctor to see weather my mono is back and he did some bloodtests for my liver that was affected and also antigens which all came up clear and he told me my mono is in remission. 
I still felt discomfort swallowing + burping and hiccups + digestive issues and also some back and joint pain and just generally didn't feel so I went to see a GI and told him of my symptoms. He put me under suspicion for GERD ( LPR) and set up an endoscopy appointment. I was terrified and did a lot of Google searching I made myself believe that I had eusophageal cancer. In the waiting period I went through a hell of depression and anxiety but my endoscopy results came back completely clear. During this time I was waiting I stared eating healthy and exercising and taking 40mg of Omeprazole which he prescribed for my reflux. I felt better and my throat got a lot better as well but I stared having more and more digestive problems such as growling, sporadic pains, changes in bowel movements and one that really stands out is extreme flatulence. I don't have blood in my stool or really have  really bad diarrhea or constipation. I also haven't lost any weight, if anything I've gained a bit ( which is a bit weird considering the exercising).
I went to see my GI again and we scheduled a colonoscopy on the 26th and also sono, bloodwork and stool samples. 
The reason I'm worried is that I have a family History of bowel cancer. My father was diagnosed with it when he was 50 and he's still fighting it today. 
I'm terribly worries and my health anxiety is really not helping things. I know I've done all that I could at this point and I just have to get through the colonoscopy but I still feel terrible. 
I should also mention that I did get sono done recently at my gynecologist and he didn't see anything suspicious.

My screen time on my laptop was 8h today cos I just watched netflix, but I don't want to jut be glued to screens all the time, but I also don't have the ability to concentrate on reading or the strength to do anything really.

I don’t know how to deal with going in for this test on Friday knowing it was one of the last things my sister had before she passed, it wasn’t the reason she died but I struggle with a lot of flash backs (I am on a waiting list for PTSD treatment).

I understand they're not a long term solution, but as a 22yr old male diagnosed about 1.5 years ago, I've always been a bit bitter about the fact that both my PCP and GI denied me any narcotics to treat the insane pain we all go through during a flare up. I'm in California. My question is, do I have ANY ability to get ANY pain meds stronger than fucking Tylenol to help me sleep or even get out of bed during a flare up? I hate the fact that I am left to suffer through the pain until the flare subsides (whenever that happens). Do I need to get referred to a pain specialist? Would they also deny me for drug seeking behavior? I don't want to get addicted to pain meds, I just want some damn relief for when I need it man, it's so unfair. I legitimately think I will turn to more illicit methods of managing my pain if I can't get actual help from people who I thought cared about me. Additionally, do I need to be referred to like a therapist or something? I honestly just need a medical professional to talk to about my mental health, I got too much on my mind to let it keep bubbling under the surface.

I also have celiac, POTS, CRPS, and psoriatic arthritis.

I have less of these IBS flare ups while on the xeljanz although I still have some, they’re mild. 

I reached out to my PCP and he recommended to just see GI as it’s worth while at this point. I see my rheumatologist this week and will tell her what’s going on as well. 

My GI appointment is 6/8. In the meantime, is there something I should request from my rheum (blood work wise) prior to my GI appointment? My rheumatologist is pretty cool and will just order whatever I ask. I just want to make the most out of this GI appointment!

The purpose of this research study is to better understand how communication plays a role in shaping identities and relationships after an Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) diagnosis and the role food plays in exposure of an IBD diagnosis. I am most concerned with situations in which we are exposed as living with IBD and how those exposures affect identities and relationships with family, friends, and significant others. I am also curious as to what exposes us a living with IBD. 

To explore this, I am looking for women that have been diagnosed with a form of IBD (either Crohn’s Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) and are between 18-40 years of age. For the research study, I would meet with the participants for anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours for a one-time interview during the duration of the study. The meetings will be held virtually via Skype or Zoom depending on the participant’s preference. Participants may benefit in terms of support for their illness through the interview and from the principal investigator (Jessica Lolli). Participants will also be directed to resources for support should they choose to do so. There is no compensation for participating in this study.

If you know of anyone who may be interested in participating in this study, please have them direct message or email Jessica Lolli. My email is [jlolli@usf.edu](mailto:jlolli@usf.edu).",2021-04-26 19:11:59

I messaged my PCP about my erratic stomach. I have IBS-D like symptoms off and on without any real cause which has really affected my life. I also have celiac, psoriatic arthritis, and POTS. My PCP says it’s worth seeing GI but they’re probably going to want to scope to rule in or out IBD. 

Is it possible to be diagnosed with a combination of blood tests, stool test, and MRI/CT? 

Having POTS and going through scope prep wouldn’t be pretty. If I don’t eat enough, I pass out without warning to begin with. I’m just trying to avoid it at all costs. 

I’m currently on xeljanz for my PsA which seems to also keep my stomach issues at bay.

Symptoms (present for years)
Urgent needs to use the bathroom 
Elevated CRP & ESR (already diagnosed PsA)
Occasional diarrhea 
Mild nausea 
Did have high liver counts until starting xeljanz

I've been planning to thru-hike the AT in 2022 for a couple years but this past winter I was diagnosed with UC and since then haven't responded to the easy drugs, got steroid dependent (yay), and am now having to choose a biologic therapy. Logistically, this has me pretty stumped on my dirty hiker dreams. Has anyone on here thru-hiked or traveled for a significant amount of time with a medication like this? Also, have your dealt with travelers insurance and these meds? Literally any experience would be helpful.

For those unfamiliar with the details of ""thru-hiking"", I'd be backpacking for 6 months straight. There's plenty of trail towns that I'll be passing through/by and for the most part, I could pick up mail drops at post offices or stores every week at least. 

My fears are as follows: if I choose IV infusions, it'll be a nightmare to coordinate with infusion centers along the way (I should only have to deal with this 2-3 times if the 8 week frequency works for me). If I choose self-admin injections, it'll be a nightmare trying to get post offices to hold special medical packages for me to pick up (more frequent, I'm looking at one that's every 4 weeks, Simponi). Also the umbrella fear that my (assumed) mediocre travelers insurance will make this all too expensive for me to even pull it off.

Any ideas? Advice? Memes to cheer me up?

I got these results on the 19th, I then did some more blood tests on the 21st a long with another stool sample, I got the results on the 25th my CRP levels had dropped to 12, however my Faecal Calprotectin Content showed 331, I just went to a private gastroenterologist and showed him these results as the wait for one on the NHS is 6-8 months, I said about how I used ibuprofen from Jan-March and Naproxen throughout March as I know this can effect the GI area, he ultimately said that I shouldn't be worried as this is the likely cause, he suggested it'd be a good idea for me to do another Stool sample to see what my levels are now, he said he would email my GP, because if I need to be seen again, he'd get it done via referral so I wouldn't have to spend money as I know a Coloscopy can cost quite a fair bit of money.

End of the day, I know all a stool sample does is show the inflammation levels and a stool sample alone will not be able to tell if somebody has an IBD, not only that, I took the stool sample when I started feeling better, which my GP and GI doctor both said is a big positive, but the tests could possibly have been done during the end of a flare, if I did one during the 2 weeks, this could've been ridiculously high. My bowl movements are back to normal at the moment, I just still have slight discomfort at the top of my abdomen, like it feels tight, something that I said to the gastroenterologist.

Ultimately, I guess I'll just have to wait to see if another 'Flare up' occurs, but should I be concerned at all?

I'm not in a flare according to tests. I take azathioprine 175mg and Simponi for Crohn's. I've had a terminal ileum resection couple of years back, just a very short bit of the small intestine.  

I know some have BAM issues and I think I might have a little. I eat a pretty low fat diet. Usually my stools are solid, especially the first one like in the morning or in the middle of the day. But sometimes I have to go a second time, it's often ok but lately I feel like the second is always loose(r), and when it is I usually feel a bit weird before and it's more urgent. 

My diet is mostly kefir with oats/oatmeal, sourdough bread with goat cheese, oatmilk, bananas, potatoes, carrots, onion, rice, chicken, cod, salmon, cucumber, iceberg salad, feta, avocado. I chew a lot, I cook and peel most food. 

I know it's impossible to tell but could it be something that triggers me or just IBD/BAM in general? I don't eat much fat so you'd think BAM wouldn't be an issue. I've experimented a lot with fiber, trying to have soluble fiber to each meal and avoid insoluble fiber.

I'm also a bit curious to if Simponi really is the biological for me. Seems to be mostly for UC. My inflammation used to be in terminal ileum and after it's been some in the colon, mostly in the sigmoidum.

Also mornings seem to be the worst time for me and I usually just stay between my bed and the bathroom for an hour or more when I wake up, does this occur to anyone else?

I’ve had a vague diagnosis of IBS for just over a year now based on blood tests coming back normal but I’m not convinced. I’m temporarily under the care of a dietitian before going back to the gp, and we have discovered that onions and garlic make symptoms worse but are not the cause of the problems as the symptoms are still there without consuming those things (just not as bad). 

I spend nearly every morning running back and forth to the bathroom with added awful pains and mucus. I get pain in my joints and ridiculous levels of fatigue. My GP from the start has been reluctant to refer me for any scopes as he doesn’t think I need them. My blood and stool samples came back fine but when they were taken I was feeling okay, so surely any active inflammation would have subsided if I wasn’t in pain at the time? I don’t really want the scopes (actually terrified at the thought!) but I just don’t think it’s IBS as I have not identified any triggers over the last year of tracking everything that could possibly cause it. 
I’m in the UK if it helps, can I refer myself? Would you go private if you were me?

Its also caused me Blepharitis which is inflammation of the eyelids!

I'm Autistic and I hate sticky textures so the creams that have been prescribed to help with these issues, I just can't have them on my skin!

I've spoken to my doctor who is happy with me coming off the treatment and has advised me on what happens if I was to relapse again, other treatment options etc. He gave me a bit of time to decide if I wanted to discontinue or not so I've done a lot of research, looking at other peoples experiences etc to help me come to my decision.

I'm a guy of 27 years old, 6ft and 218lbs.

Hope you are all well, sorry for my questions but I want to tell you that I am very stressed at the moment because of my problem, I have no insurance for the moment..

So, i have now had pain in my stomach and below the ribs for more than 2 months,

its started below the left side under my ribs, I had a burning pain and a disconformt it was not really a pain but more of a discomfort. First I went to urgent care, doctor was thinking it was Costochondritis so she give me Naproxen but have seen really fast that it was not my ribs.

After I went to the emergency room because I was really stressed about the discomfort, they gave me blood tests and a CT scan of the abdomen pelvis. They said me that all was good on the ct scan and they told me it was dyspepsia, they put me on famotidine for 14 days, when I got home I noticed that my lipase level was high compared to the standards so II'l decided to go back to another hospital three days later to do a lipase test (I had not eaten for almost 20 hours because I was fasting for my second lipase test) result my lipase was normal and I went home.

But now, I have terrible stomach pain after eating, I burp all the time, I have a lot of gas, I have back pain when waking up and going to bed. And I have the impression that even my stools are different, they alternate every day, sometimes diahrrea sometimes normal sometimes small. I even feel like I have more pain in my stomach after using the bathroom to poop.

And it's on both sides of the belly,  it's even when I drink water. I didn't take any meds because I don't know what could help me relieve this pain but it's really annoying, from 1 to 10 I would say 5/6. I don't cry in pain but I feel like I can't eat anything without directly seeing pain a few minutes later and burping directly.

I also feel that my stomach is hard and swollen. I also feel like I pee more often than before.

I don't feel nauseous, I'm not tired, I eat normally, and I don't feel like I've lost weight.

But its starting to make me feel relieved and I'm starting to get a little paranoid having to look at my stool every day, afraid to eat so as not to have pain. Because I don't have pain when I don't eat.

Anyone have any suggestions or have the same symptoms please ?",2021-05-07 13:39:16

I've been on infliximab for 10+ years, and my doctors have consistently been checking the level. They were going through Prometheus Labs initially, but recently the test has been opened up to other places. It's never been covered by any insurance I've had, as it is regarded as ""investigational"" (which is bullshit, imo) However, with Prometheus I used to qualify for a low-income waiver which halved the cost, as I was not making much money at the time.

I got the test at LabCorp last year, and my insurance said it was not covered - and this time I have to pay $350. I'm not looking forward to paying that much every time I get the test.

I've been on the phone for hours with the insurance company, and I either have to appeal or give it. I'm pretty sure I'll lose the appeal as my EOB is clear - but there's also a second, more independent appeal process if I lose.

Has anyone ever appealed a biologic serum / antibody test? Also reached out to the Jennifer Jaff Foundation to learn more about my options, but I guess I'm not looking forward to putting in all this time and effort just to get rejected, and interested in other's experiences.",2021-05-07 02:38:36

I have seen top specialists in the IBD community and I have NEVER received this kind of comprehensive, evidence-based dietary recommendation. I didn't know myristic acid was a problem for UC. Of course everyone's dietary needs are different, but I hope this helps!!

**What Should I Eat? Evidence Based Nutrition Recommendations for Patients with IBD**

Good nutrition can help play a role in your overall health and management of your symptoms. New and ongoing research shows it can help reduce inflammation associated with IBD. The table above summarizes existing research into which food groups are better for your IBD. Of course, if something is good for Ulcerative Colitis (UC), it is likely also good for Crohn's Disease (CD), though the studies may not yet have shown this. Recommendations were developed by the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD).

**Fruits and Vegetables** For patients with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis, it is advised to increase fiber intake through consumption of fruits and vegetables. Evidence from nutritional studies have demonstrated improved symptoms in patients following a diet high in fruits and vegetables. For patients with a known stricture, it is advised to eat less amounts of high-fiber foods. Foods such as plantains, broccoli, apples, and bananas have been shown to be most beneficial. Additionally, it is recommended for patients to avoid fiber supplements and to reach fiber goals through whole foods.

**Carbohydrates** In patients with Crohn's Disease, it is advised to reduce intake of refined sugars and carbohydrates. Studies have demonstrated that there is an association between higher refined sugar intake such as before clinical flares. Examples of refined sugars and grains include white bread, pasta, white rice, white flour, sweet desserts, breakfast cereals, etc. There is insufficient evidence to recommend reduction of complex carbohydrates in patients with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis. Complex carbohydrates include whole wheat or multigrain bread, brown rice, oatmeal, etc.

**Dietary Fat** In patients with Crohn's Disease, it is recommended to reduce intake of saturated fats. Saturated fats can be found in products including cheese, pizza, desserts, and other processed foods. Patients with Ulcerative Colitis are recommended to reduce consumption of myristic acid which can be found in products like palm oil, coconut oil, or dairy fats. Patients with Ulcerative Colitis are also encouraged to increase intake of Omega-3 fatty acids from fish sources rather than supplements. It is recommended all patients with IBD should consider increasing intake of olive oil. Additionally, all patients with a form of IBD should strictly limit or eliminate intake of trans fats.

**Processed Foods and Ultra-processed Foods** Evidence from multiple studies suggests ingredients used to process foods such as Maltodextran, Artificial Sweeteners, Emulsifiers, Gums, Microparticles, and Carrageenans are associated with increased incidence of IBD, worsening of symptoms, and increased inflammation in patients with IBD. It is recommended patients reduce or eliminate intake to foods that include these ingredients. Examples include:

* Ice Cream
* Soy Milk
* Pre-made Sauces
* Dairy-based Desserts
* Frozen Meals
* Processed Meats
* Candies
* Dressings
* Powdered foods
* Dried or Canned Fruits",2021-05-08 17:34:52

1422,Anyone taken Allergy Shots?,Its_Jessica_Day,11,n7d35p,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/n7d35p/anyone_taken_allergy_shots/,15,"Brief history: diagnosed with Crohn’s/UC in 2000, basically sick for 10 years, exhausted all medical options, had total protocolectomy and end ileostomy in 2010. In remission and medication free since (they weren’t sure if I had Crohn’s or UC, but they were leaning towards UC). 

This past March I started taking allergy shots once a week to treat my seasonal allergies. Lately I have been having more Crohn’s-type symptoms. I have been trying to figure out why and if they are actually IBD-related or not, and of course praying it’s something else. 

My question is, has anyone heard of allergy shots having any impact on IBD? I also got the COVID vaccine in March (Pfizer), so I’m wondering if that is related too. 

I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts. I’m hoping this is nothing but of course I am worried. I have an appt with my GI in a few weeks. Thank you in advance for your experiences!",2021-05-08 02:25:11

After a few phone consultations, was told it was a stomach bug a few days into it, then food poisoning a week into it, however towards the end of the 2 weeks when I began to recover, my GP said I should do a stool sample which showed high inflammation, had a high Calprotectin Content, my GP wanted to refer me to a GI for a possible colonoscopy etc, but due to the NHS wait time being anywhere between 6-10 months, I went to a private GI who said the same thing as my GP, considering im feeling so much better now, I shouldn't worry, ofcourse there was way more discussed, ultimately that was it, I ended up going back to my GP whos now referred me, but now I'm just having to wait and it's mentally frustrating and its effecting me daily.

Don't get me wrong, I feel so much better now, but still not great, my bowel movements are back to normal and have been for a while, I did a food diary for a few weeks which showed no triggers, the only issues im having now is that my lower left rib area feels quite sensitive, its by the top of abdomen and sometimes radiates to the right side and very rarely, across the whole top of my abdomen. I'm just ultimately getting so frustrated waiting for a diagnoses, it could be nothing, it could be something, but it's the not knowing that sucks. I worry that I could have IBD, but the colonoscopy could be in a remission phase and not show, I can be sitting there enjoying life and then I'll randomly think about what it could be and it'll ruin the rest of my day.

I'll admit, it doesn't help looking into IBD symptons every few days, but I can't help it and I feel like I'll continue doing this till I finally get some form of diagnoses. Apart from those 2 weeks of torture, I've pretty much managed to go back to my daily life without any issues and enjoying myself going out on weekends etc, but no matter where I am or what I'm doing, as soon as I think off all the possibilities, it'll put me in such a horrible mode.

1426,Advice needed after failing colonoscopy?,ihitrocksbottom,5,n8d9ia,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/n8d9ia/advice_needed_after_failing_colonoscopy/,18,"I've had crohn's for 10 years and in recent months I've been unwell (bit of a long story) so I had to have a colonoscopy. My fist one that I had 4 years ago went completely normal, no issues with prep and the actual procedure.  


This time though was a bit different. I've hardly been eating recently due to being unwell. I didn't drink the 2 litres of prep that was required, but about 1.75...I didn't take the whole 2 litres because I thought there wouldn't be much to get out of my system because I hadn't been eating much. Plus it makes me feel nauseous and I was worried about severe cramps. It took 2 hours after my first drink of that prep stuff in the evening that I went to toilet. and that was it. I thought it was really odd. When I did my first prep 4 years ago I had to just stay in the bathroom in the evening because of how many times I wanted to go. I just assumed that I would still get a lot of liquid coming out regardless of how much I had eaten previously. In the middle of the night and the morning, however, I went multiple times.    


I also had to take another litre in the morning before my afternoon procedure so it made me worry about needing it whilst at hospital.  I purposely took it earlier in the morning than it said to so it wouldn't happen.  
I was still going to toilet 30 minutes before I left for the hospital. Whilst there I didn't have a proper urge to go but I didn't feel like my bowels were completely empty. I went to the hospital bathroom and tried to go but couldn't.   


I have the colonoscopy and I'm not someone that likes to look at the screen as it's being done but they told me to look. I looked and it was quite a lot of stools floating about. I was a bit embarrassed and perplexed as to how they were still there, as like I said I hadn't been eating much at all in the previous days. and although there seemed to be a delay in me going to toilet after having prep I did go loads of times in middle of night/morning. How could there still be some there? So they had to abort the procedure. The dreaded Covid test, disgusting prep etc all a waste of time. Trouble is, I have no idea if it's going to be the same next time. I don't know what to do differently. They said to have one more litre but I feel that would make me keep going even when they're calling me to have it done.  


I'm going to mention this just in case this might be a factor. Because I've been unwell and subsequently lost weight I was eager to put on weight so I ate grated cheese throughout the day and probably had maybe a bit too much. I think cheese can cause constipation and that's what I was getting a little less than a week before my procedure. And also hard stools (I've been getting that on and off for 3 1/2 years) but could that be the problem? I just assumed the prep would get everything out.",2021-05-09 14:28:49

1439,Any advice with UC actually being Chrons?,Glittering-Ad-1773,9,na87le,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/na87le/any_advice_with_uc_actually_being_chrons/,23,"I am currently 18 years old and my symptoms seem to have appeared out of thin air. After about a month or two and my symptoms getting much worst, I had a colonoscopy in January. The colonoscopy was done by a general surgeon, so she did not really know much about IBD. She reported her findings, took a couple of images, and gave them to me. The surgeon told me she was certain I had ulcerative colitis, but I also had inflammation in my stomach (gastritis). She told me the gastritis could be due to my use of NSAIDs.

I sent the files to the GI clinic. When I called the GI doctor, an assistant answered and basically just told me the protocol for treatment. He said 2g of an enema of mesalamine at night, and then told me to taper off. Then that was it. The phone call did not discuss anything nor was it a second opinion. 

I had switched from the enema to the suppositories since the inflammation was in the rectum and lower sigmoid colon. At first, this worked great. When I saw the GI, he told me to try to taper off medication. Did not work so I went back to the usual dose. Long story short, my symptoms have returned to the severity it was before plus more. I think it may have been triggered by the Amoxicillin I had to take, because of wisdom teeth removal (I do not know).

I have also never had an issue with loose stools and diarrhea, so I thought the disease spread further up the colon. I had the suppositories switched to an enema. My thought process was the enema could reach farther up somehow. The medication is not doing anything and I am kind of worried this is going to get much worse.

I am going to talk to my GI soon, but the big question I have is if I have [chrons](https://chrons.In)? In the colonoscopy, my surgeon said there was only 1 ""active"" lesion, but every time she tried to touch the intestines they would bleed. She also said there was mild inflammation in my stomach. I used to have painful periods so I would take high doses of Ibuprofen (nothing past the limit), so she said the gastritis was due to this. However, I stopped taking NSAIDs at least 5 weeks before the surgery. It would not make sense why I would continue to have gastritis. 

I have a phone call with the GI soon to ask about medication, but I need to know if anyone has had any experience with UC actually being Chrons. I am going to college soon, in 2 months, and I need to know if it is worth getting another colonoscopy and another opinion? I know I could ask my GI all of this, but from reddit I learned to not taper off of medications. Yet, my doctor advised me to taper of medicine which made my symptoms return. I also wonder if the medication never really worked and I just was in remission for a couple of weeks. This disease is taking so much out of me and I wonder if I will want to deal with this any longer.",2021-05-11 23:26:51

So today is the 12th day my husband has had digestive issues.. started as an urgency to have a bowel movement, after eating cheese, and had mild diarrhea. Next day, same thing. This pattern continued on for 2-3 days until his mild diarrhea turned completely red. We assumed it was the hot Cheetos he had eaten a few days prior, but I’m thinking that was a stupid synopsis. 

He had passed a large blob of mucus, about the size of my palm, and proceeded to continue to pass mucus. There was blood clots within the mucus. After a couple days go by of that, my husband starts having watery, severe diarrhea that is mixed with blood. You can see tiny clots of blood, for a day there was black floating things, and his diarrhea was mostly red again. Around this time, he started to feel 10/10 on the pain scale abdominal cramping. He hasn’t been eating, he has a hard time drinking fluids, and he’s developed nausea. Whenever he vomits it’s only stomach acid, and he only gets nauseous with the abdominal cramping (located in the lower left abdomen originally. Has progressed to his entire abdomen as of today). 

He hasn’t had a fever a single time. He has severe back pain and stiffness, and prior to this becoming worse, he was having pretty bad joint pain in his knees, ankles, and wrists. He has been extremely lethargic and sleeps for 5-6 hour stretches, to wake up to abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and nausea. 

Last night he had gone entirely ghost white and I called 911. They transported him via ambulance and at the ER, they hydrated him, gave him an anti nausea, and a medication to control his stomach acid. He had a CT scan there that were consistent with infectious or inflammatory colitis, and needs to follow up with a gastroenterologist. All the inflammation was in his large bowel, where he has diffuse bowel wall thickening. He was prescribed with two antibiotics and an anti nausea medication. 

Spending the day today sleeping, he was able to eat some popsicles, jello, and potatoes. I’ve been trying to keep him hydrated. He had three instances of severe cramping (he was in tears and has a hard time moving at this point), bloody diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting stomach acid. In the third instance, with his diarrhea still red/brown, I noticed a darker blood clot. And I am concerned because I don’t want this to continue to get worse and I have zero clue how to help him.. 

Any advice is appreciated and any insight is welcome because I am alone with my two children trying to help him for going on almost two weeks, and it feels like I’m failing..",2021-05-12 09:05:13

I'm really worried about it because I'm on 40mg right now and have been for over a week and they told me they don't know how it will react but ""its probably better than catching covid"". 

I'm hoping that it won't affect me too much and that the faith I've put in my doctors is warranted. I'll probably update this post in a few days for anyone who's interested or in a similar situation though :)




Update: so its been 48 hours now and I've had a sore arm which is wearing off, a bit of a headache and felt a bit off but nothing bad and nowhere near as bad as the 1st vaccine.

I once pooped literally only blood. Just pouring blood out of my ass, and went to ER, nothing. No internal bleeding, nothing, lab tests fine, sent me back home
After that i got infected with campylobacter, and after 14 days of struggling with 16x diahrreas a day, not being able to lower my body temp, it fially passed
Few days after that i got my first colonoscopy. Without anesthetic, so I couldn't, just 15cm with biopsy
Doctor told my mom i have signs of inflammation, and its most likely chrons. Didn't give me ANY MEDS.
Diahrreas stopped. I ate everything. I gained weight normally. My fecal calprotectin always came back normal. But in 2019 i got cdiff. Since then it all went south
I have severe endometriosis, and it took them 3 years of me begging to get surgery. Finally got surgery, and they took out my fallopian tube. After that for 2 weeks i was even ok. But now it started again. I have stool once a day
Once.
I also sometimes have blood in my stool. Visible bright red. I have done two more colonoscopies in 3 years WITHOUT biopsy because they said : your colon looks fine, so we didn't take biopsy. Spastic colon, diverticuls, and internal hemms.
But I have daily flatuence, i am in so much pain every single day. I lost 15 kg in 3years,so anorexic I can't even. I'm scared to eat. I don't have ibs as they diagnosed me since I don't shit 5-6 times a day. I don't have constipations. I don't. I have also hiatal hernia and gerb. I am miserable. I cannot afford on my tortured body another colonoscopy. I even done mri enterography to see my colon to see for chrons, it showed no abnormality. I am so tired. Please can someone tell me.. Can they mistake this at colonoscopy? By not taking biopsy. In remission does chron or uc hide? Stupid to say hide.. Let's say... Can they make a mistake. Because my endometriosis was undiagnosed for 17 years (I'm 32) and no ultrasound, no mri, nothing no signs of endo untill they opened me up, even then only inflammed organ (fallopian tube) and ONLY biopsy confirmed endo. Please help I am so scared I am not sleeping because cramps wake me. Doctors are mocking me I am a dr. House case because my lab test come back normal but my anti tpo is 5000. I have hashimoto.

I joined the gym about 2 weeks ago after watching a YouTube video that recommended the gym and have been doing quite intense workouts (mostly glutes/quads/knees focused) but I have been constantly hungry since. I’ve been consuming over 2000 calories a day. I had constant hunger before I started my strict calorie limit but not as intense as this. I also have a hiatal hernia so eating so much really hurts but I can’t control myself. Before I would even eat in my sleep but be able to control it while I am awake but I haven’t been able to control it while awake since I started the gym and I’m starting to eat in my sleep again (3 times so far in the last 2 weeks).

My joint pain have been reduced quite a bit since I started the gym and will stick to it but the hunger is driving me insane. I’ve been eating everything I see even my trigger foods :/. I get 100g protein and 25-35g of fibre daily and I am 5ft 1 and weigh 54Kg/119lbs. I drink 2-4 litres/ half a gallon-gallon of water a day. I think absorption might be an issue? I can’t get on medication for Crohn’s yet because I have latent tuberculosis so I have to get some scans and consult with a respiratorist, which will take some time.

I have though constantly struggled with IBS during remission.  The first bad flare I had in recent years was about 18 months ago and was the first time I was prescribed prednisone, 50mg at first and after a few days I was a complete zombie mainly due to lack of sleep. Tried  all kinds of different sleeping tablets but none of them really worked.   it really fucked me up mentally and I needed about 3 weeks off work during which i reduced my dose by 5mg a week. 

So i weaned my way off them over a couple of months and it worked and the UC went away.  Been battling this current flare up for a few months now and dreaded the thought of going back on the Pred due to having such a horrible time with them so started on 25mg this time after talking to my doc,  this instantly fucked me up again with sleep and a zombie state and had to take sick leave from work.   Symptoms did ease and am now about 3 weeks into imuran.   However now my UC is coming back and it seems like the only quickish relief come with Prednisone makes me unable to work and puts stress on me and then in a cycle of stress and symptons.   

So  my question is how do you guys manage to sleep or cope with everyday life while on Pred and with imuran I was told could take 6 months to work, has that been the experience for you guys?",2021-05-19 06:18:01

I haven’t posted my story or reached out for lack of energy. I am really struggling. I began symptoms in early March of this year, the usual, blood, fatigue, extreme pain, urgency and frequency. What makes matters more complicated is I am pregnant. After 2 visits to the ER (with no admission) and 2 visits to urgent care and multiple calls to my ob I was admitted to the hospital. At this time I was about 15/16 weeks pregnant.  I had lost about 25 lbs, had a fever and baby’s heart rate was up. I was in the hospital for 6 days on fluids, stadol, mesalamine and steroids. My ob was unsure what to do as this obviously isn’t her area of expertise and the gi doc seemed scared to treat me too aggressively due to the pregnancy. Both saying they had never had a patient get diagnosed during pregnancy and that my case was rare. I am unofficially diagnosed with uc as they only did an endoscopy and want me to have a colonoscopy after the baby is born. They sent me home when I was still very sick and couldn’t walk without assistance. The gi wanted to discharge me as it was the weekend and he’d “had a long week and didn’t want to come in on Saturday” if he didn’t have to. Sent home with prednisone and mesalamine. I was still very sick with little progress after a couple of weeks of that so we began remicade. When I was still not gaining weight they finally referred me to the IBD clinic at Vanderbilt university. Things have improved some since then as they upped my remicade dosage, sent me to a dietician and a maternal fetal medicine doctor. I just wish they hadn’t waited so long to refer me as my condition got worse during that time. I have gone back to work part time but still have difficulty performing day to day tasks let alone just be able to be present with my son and husband. I had my third dose of remicade yesterday and have one more before the baby is due. I just feel so helpless, I am constantly hurting, have zero energy and cannot plan for my baby’s arrival. I don’t know what I am looking for in posting this, maybe encouragement that it will get better or advice from anyone that has been through something similar.

It made things not great but totally managable.  Gi appointment, tests, only thing the blood and stool samples said was iron absorption issues.  Definately no Crohn's or Celiac.  Colonoscopy like a month later (2 weeks ago).  I know now I have IBD, lymphocytic colitis.  I'm SO HAPPY to have a diagnosis and am now on budesonide.  Today was the first time in 16 days that i've gone to the bathroom and it looked some what normal ....

I've read everything from fodmap, to low protein, to low lactose, low fiber, I just don't know who to listen to.  In addition, what's best for Crohn's, Ulcerative Colitis, Lymphocytic colitis, seems to vary and there aren't as many places I can find that seem appropriate.

1525,Just starting my diagnosis journey...,-kkmonster-,5,nikydz,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/nikydz/just_starting_my_diagnosis_journey/,4,"So I’m just starting my journey for potential IBD. I just recently got health insurance for the first time in almost 10 years, through the marketplace so I’m excited to finally/hopefully get something resolved. 

Everything started approximately 5-6 years ago with a trip to the ER for unexplained right sided flank pain (suspected kidney stone/infection). Was given morphine and dilauded, which barely touched the discomfort. Numerous imaging done X-Ray, transvaginal ultrasound and abd/pelvis CT w/ contrast... all for them to say “we don’t know what’s wrong with you, here’s a presc for pain meds and antibiotics”. Totally love getting bills for thousands of dollars when you couldn’t even give me a general idea. After all that I was able to access my chart for that hospital recently and it seems whoever interpreted my CT didn’t even inspect the GI tract at all!

Then another trip to a family walk in clinic 3 years ago for the same symptoms. Again suspected kidney stone was given Flomax and macrobid (I had a horrible reaction to the macrobid, severe muscle pain that felt like I had ran a marathon), went back bc of the adverse reaction, and he took me off the meds and sent me to a Urologist. 

Urologist ordered another CT of abd/pelvis and found “colitis”, 7mm circumferential bowel wall thickening of cecum, ascending and proximal transverse colon. No diverticula (thank goodness cause my grandmother had horrible diverticulitis). He offered to send me to a GI, but said he could prescribe what they would probably start out with too, which was antibiotics and pain meds again. That’s what I did because I had already shelled out tons of money out of pocket for the CT and just to see him each time. At some point during this treatment I ended up having horrible diarrhea one morning opening at work (4:30am) that I walked out of the bathroom having just shit, and passed out in our lobby and shit my pants! At least I wore my brown pants that day! Eventually my symptoms subsided after living on saltine crackers for 3 weeks. 

It’s hard not having insurance. 

I’ve since been dealing with chronic diarrhea or constipation, with severe urgency in the morning (I’m sure coffee doesn’t help that) not really an in between. And just general malaise, fatigue etc.

So I went to my new GP and she ran blood work that included an ANA panel since she suspects some kind of IBD. I just got results back last night (of course it had to be a Friday) in my quest app showing a positive result. I don’t know what this all means. I’m hoping they call me Monday to explain it all and to schedule a follow up. 

I’m curious how many people have had a positive ANA and did it directly point to or correlate with your IBD, or was it some other autoimmune issue? Or was it nothing at all?

I am currently working on a research study (study # 002078) at the University of South Florida. The purpose of this research study is to better understand how communication plays a role in shaping identities and relationships after an Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) diagnosis and the role food plays in exposure of an IBD diagnosis. I am most concerned with situations in which we are exposed as living with IBD and how those exposures affect identities and relationships with family, friends, and significant others. I am also curious as to what exposes us a living with IBD.

To explore this, I am looking for women that have been diagnosed with a form of IBD (either Crohn’s Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) for at least 1 year and are between 18-40 years of age. For the research study, I would meet with the participants for anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours for a one-time interview during the duration of the study. The meetings will be held virtually via Skype or Zoom depending on the participant’s preference. Participants may benefit in terms of support for their illness through the interview and from the principal investigator (Jessica Lolli).

That turned into constant low grade fevers and sweats. I started to get a chronic cough,sinus pressure/pain and loss of hearing in the morning, went to ent and he told me it was being caused by stomach acid creeping up while I’m sleeping. Around January I started with my hands and feet going numb while I’m sleeping, severe bloating to the point I couldn’t sit down without pain and feeling like I was gonna pass out. I started to experience sever pain in my legs and arms and high blood pressure and a rapid heart rate. Went to my pcp and they did a lot of blood work everything came back normal except the Ana that came back 1:40 speckled and a barely positive dsdna pcp suspected lupus. I got put on plaquenil 400mg but that didn’t really help at all. I was still feeling like crap and I was super anxious and at a point where I couldn’t even sleep. The anxiety and stress made everything worse my stomach got so bloated on week to the point where I couldn’t poop that whole week and my stomach kept getting bigger I went to the hospital got a ct scan and they said I had colitis they send me home with a referral to a gi and now I’m waiting for the 17th of June to see him. My rheumotoglist put me on prednisone and that has really helped me some what more than the plaquenil. I’m actually able to sit down now without pain, but my stomach still feels wacky I constantly feel like pooping and my insides sometimes feel like they are on fire best way I can describe it is hot liquid going down my stomach, oh and the dizziness I’ve been feeling really dizzy for the past month . I’ve been watching out for things that make it worse food wise and I got lactose from my diet.

I’ve had stomach issues as long as I can remember. In the last 3 or so years it’s gotten really bad to the point I’m in pain for like an hour or so before I can actually use the bathroom. The pain comes in waves and is always in my lower abdomen. Then of course comes the diarrhea, inability to go even though it really feels like I have to, bloody stools, and really extreme bloating. This happens once a month-once every six weeks or so. Last month I was on a trip visiting a friend and ended up in the hospital because my pain was so bad and there was a lot of blood in my stool. They did a CT and diagnosed me with colitis and said to follow up with a gastro. Got home & had colonoscopy scheduled for about a month after the episode (yesterday). The doctor who did it said everything looked normal and that it’s probably just because I don’t have daily bms. I feel like he’s wrong and there’s no way that’s the cause of these crazy symptoms.

AND my Xeljanz co-pay is going to be ZERO dollars with the Xeljanz co-pay assistance program. Their pharmacist was kind and informative as well. He checked for any interactions with all my other meds without me even asking him to, and he made me feel better about the possible serious side effects, like blood clots, informing me that they are very, very rare.

I used to have frequent constipation and I was sensitive to some foods like dairy and stuff but nothing crazy. I would just take laxatives and such and the problem would be fixed, but I didn’t think it was that out of the ordinary to be having those problems for so long because my entire family also has stomach issues (both sides but mostly maternal) and they have never really said anything about getting treatment for it but I haven’t asked a lot, so I could be wrong.

In February I started sertraline for anxiety and depression and in March I started having frequent diarrhea. Pretty much it has not gotten any better since. It got so bad during the semester that I would have to skip my classes. I was referred to a GI from my school health clinic and I was tested for celiac disease and a bunch of other things but everything came out negative besides for my stool sample, which the only result that came back was that I might have potential IBD. My GI prescribed me dicyclomine for the cramping and that has helped but only with my stomach pains. 

Besides for the constant diarrhea I’ve had for the past 5 months, I also am struggling with brain fog, fatigue, achiness, headaches, indigestion, hot flashes, and weight loss (it’s significant). my colonoscopy is scheduled for the 17th of next month, so it’s kind of a while away and I was wondering if y’all had any home remedies or something that will help soothe my stomach. I have had to call out of work today and I have no appetite but I don’t know what to eat that will help. I know that it maybe might not be IBD but that seems to be what the GI suspects it is and my symptoms match up.

I never once got a stress fracture all those years I was running a ton, but in November of 2019, while on a high dose of prednisone, I got my first stress fracture in my right foot after going out for a flat 2-mile walk! I was then diagnosed with osteoporosis at age 35 (I'm now 37). It was pretty mild, so I decided to try to reverse it naturally (Vit. D, K2, calcium and exercise, also quit smoking), and a year later, my DEXA scan revealed that I was successful in reversing it back to osteopenia. I was SO relieved (and a little surprised because I had one doctor tell me it was impossible to reverse it naturally)! It was still borderline though, but I was moving in the right direction, I thought...

Now I'm on prednisone again, and once again, I feel like my same foot has a stress fracture. I sent my family doctor a message and will get it looked at, but I just wanted to post somewhere because I'm feeling pretty low right now. I wasn't even running, just walking, mostly on a flat treadmill. It wasn't anything strenuous. And when I can't exercise, my mental health really takes a nosedive. I was already not feeling great due to being in another UC flare, and now I can't even go for a walk.

I'm currently looking into surgery. Have another scope June 8 (just had one in November so not happy he is making me get another one), and then hopefully he'll let me try Xeljanz and then surgery. My UC is fine on steroids, but if it's causing me to get these fractures, this is not good. Being a runner and hiker is a huge part of my identity. When I don't exercise, my anxiety gets really bad. I was wanting to get back to running marathons someday, too. I had only gotten back up to running 2-3 miles lately, but hadn't run hardly at all in the last month due to a UC flare. I had built up to walking 3-6 miles most days though and sometimes a 9-mile hike on the weekends, but my last long hike was a month ago, so this isn't a normal ""overuse"" injury or anything of the sort. I built my mileage up slowly and was never even doing close to the mileage I used to do a few years back.

I have had unexplained symptoms for years and have been unable to find a concrete diagnosis. Recently I've been jumping around with various specialists. The rheumatologist i was seeing found nothing besides a slightly elevated RF IgM and ANA 1:320. The tests and imagining they did showed up as normal. She said it could be IBD. Neurologist found small fiber neuropathy and also said it could be from IBD. My PCP was worried it was IBD and ordered a referral to the gastro and ordered stool tests that came back normal. The gastroenterologist is still concerned and ordered a endoscopy and colonoscopy and I will be doing that in July.

The symptoms that I think got them thinking it was IBD is having mixed IBS, bloody stool, urge to go but not being able to, abdominal cramps, joint pain and inflammation, nausea, loss of appetite, and canker sores. These along with being deficient in iron and vitamin D despite taking supplements and including it in my diet. Sometimes I wake up with no appetite at all, shaky, and have diarrhea along with extreme fatigue. When my rheumatologist told me that IBD can cause peripheral arthritis I read about it because I was curious and I guess that the arthritis can be the first symptom years before abdominal symptoms which I thought was interesting.

I know everyone is different and ultimately I'll have to see what the endoscopy and colonoscopy show. I only knew about Crohn’s and UC from commercials and only started learning more about it a few months ago. I never thought I could have it because I thought for years it was RA or lupus I was dealing with due to the GI symptoms and other issues too. I also thought that in order to have it I'd have to be underweight. My weight fluctuates and I have periods of time where I gain weight and have periods where I lose it but it isn't extreme (anymore... I used to lose weight for no apparent reason when I was a teenager but don't anymore).

I'm sure this question gets asked often, but what were your experiences with being diagnosed?",2021-06-01 20:22:24

The thing is, I'm not on the right age group (I'm 29), symptoms had a sudden intake (I can pin point the day), and I'm not having the classic watery diarrhea (I didn't realise anything wrong with my stools for a long time, now they're just a little malformed).My point is: my main symptom has been, from the start, swelling in the abdomen, with distention, and pain. Not classic cramps from eating something bad, a very different feeling, that I can only associate with inflammation now that I know I have LC.

I've been put on prednisone, and then budesonide, which didn't help much and gave me a lot of side effects. About that time, my GI Doctor said the inflammation was probably just a part of IBS, and took me out of steroids. I've seen some improvement with the FODMAPs Diet (with made me loose 7kg already), antidepressants, glutamine and colostrum, but still, pain and swelling. My stools look fine.

I gain and lose a LOT of weight over and over again over time. 2014 I was 145lbs, and 2015 I was down to 125, before going back up to 145 in 2016. It went down just a bit in 2017 (130s?). By mid-2018 I was about 155, before dropping to 125 the end of the year. In 2019 I got up to 165lbs and over 2020 dropped 50lbs to 115, which is about where I am now. (I'm 5'4"")

None of this was intentional, or the result of dieting or increased exercise. Generally, I don't exercise (it's not super healthy, I know, but I'm so exhausted all of the time).

The prep was grim - I didn’t find the actual toilet stuff that awful but drinking it was horrible and made me so nauseous. I threw up a tiny bit of it but this didn’t impact the effectiveness.

I was feeling pretty terrible beforehand (not having eaten or drunk in a heatwave) and actually fainted having my cannula put in - I’m super squeamish with blood tests and needles so this wasn’t surprising! 

The actual procedures were fine and no where near the traumatising experiences I anticipated. I had sedation but was awake and could see the screen etc. I found the colonoscopy painful at times and have some abdominal discomfort after but it was okay! The gastroscopy (which I was terrified for as I have the worst gag reflex and just the thought of this procedure terrified me) was fine too - I think I gagged a little bit but it was all over so quickly and I couldn’t feel much - it was honestly fine and over so quickly. I hope this reassures some people! 

I didn’t get any solid answers really. My calprotectin (666) and symptoms made me think perhaps I had mild crohns or at least some kind of mild stomach acid problem or something. But nothing was found!

After I cleared my c diff infection, I continued to have abdominal pain. Had a colonoscopy done and they found a ton of inflammation, ileitis, friable bleeding, abnormal mucosa, and assumed it was Crohn’s based on how my colon looked but the biopsy came back negative. Did a capsule endoscopy to look for Crohn’s in my S.I. but not able to confirm a diagnosis with that. 

Regardless, my doc started me on Budesonide after my procedure for the ileitis and colitis and I stayed on it for about 5 months and saw improvement. However, since there was no Crohn’s diagnosis, they weened me off of it. I did okay tapering for about a month or two but after that I felt the inflammation coming back but my doc won’t let me start medication for it again unless my fecal calprotectin levels are very elevated (waiting for test results). I got a second opinion from another doc and they want to do a CT Enterography but I feel like my issues are still in the colon rather than the S.I. and they said it looks at the small intestine. 

I feel kind of trapped and don’t know how long I can last with the pain without meds. I know that if I try a third opinion I’ll likely have to get another colonoscopy and not even been a year since my last one and my capsule endoscopy.

I was just diagnosed with Crohn’s disease 4 weeks ago. I am really struggling, mentally, physically and emotionally. Especially because I work in healthcare as a dietitian for chronic disease patients in Cananda. I feel I have failed myself and everything I knew and encouraged others about nutrition is no longer working for me (I.e whole grains, fibre, fruits and veggies). My GI doc started me on Pentasa 4g/d about 2.5 weeks ago and about 1.5 weeks in, I started getting horrible body pain, and excruciating pain in my neck, chest and head. My GI doc told me to stop Pentasa right away and I did for 3 days, where my pain decreased. He said I should try it again and give it a good 8 weeks although if my symptoms come back to call him. I re-started it and that evening I was in horrible pain again which is ongoing now. I feel like I have a chest cold, I have a cough, my joints are in horrible pain I can barely walk or do any form of physical activity without either collapsing or having to grab hold of the walls or doors in my apartment. I’ve also been having diarrhea 5-6 x per day and I know from my blood work, calprotectin and other stool tests that I’m in a bad flare up.

Has anyone else experienced this with Pentasa/Mesalamine? Are these normal side effects early on and do they subside after time?

Anyways since those 2 weeks, I've slowly been recovering day by day, going to the toilet once every 2 days which is normal for me, it hasn't really been painful since those 2 weeks, but it's only been over the past week or 2 I've been feeling somewhat normal, doesn't change the fact my stomach area doesn't feel great, still feels uncomfortable and it's mainly down my left side of my abdomen.

In 5 days I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy which im quite looking foward to in truth, hopefully to try and get to the bottom of what's going on, I know I'll be informed of the process in an appointment a few days before where I'm giving my liquid to empty my weight on the toilet XD, but what should I expect, I live in the UK btw?

Also, I know symptoms wise, I probably don't have IBD as I was only extremely ill for 2 weeks, or can a flare up really be this short, but still feel it for the next few months? I am slightly worried of a misdiagnoses, I would probably feel more relief knowing they've found something.

Many thanks!

Edit: Just some additional information, when I go in for the appointment to discuss the process im gonna have some blood tests aswell, they asked me if I take any tablets like multivitamin etc which I do, but told me I'm fine to continue taking them, but they would prefer me to stick away from tablets that bost iron in the blood till the blood tests, I don't believe any of my tablets aid that, but is it that much of a problem?",2021-06-03 22:26:53

Passing mucus, sometimes with poop and sometimes without.

Passing stools which are not as big in volume as in the past, sometimes more narrow, sometimes quite normal. Sometimes some solid rabbit like pieces. Sometimes some diarrhea. But one thing I can no longer do is pass long, solid logs like I used to five years ago.

Some weight loss. Not sure if it's because of the symptoms, but my appetite is pretty much the same as five years ago.

When I was much younger (6-8ish) I had trouble with constipation lasting weeks at a time and as a teen I struggled more with extremely frequent BM. Now, as a 24 year old female leading a relatively healthy lifestyle, I've noticed my symptoms getting more severe and finally decided to visit the doctor.

My symptoms include; using the restroom an avg of 10x/day,  Intense cramps that come on suddenly and wake me at night, occasional (bright red) blood in stool (I think from going so much), as well as nausea. I'm also probably 30 lbs  overweight which I gained suddenly despite only making positive changes to my diet and exercise habits.

I had bloodwork done and most everything looks fine, except  my ALT which is slightly elevated, my vitamin b12 is low, and I'm significantly deficient in vitamin d. I have a gastro appointment next month but im trying to prepare myself/collect information ahead of time. My doctor does not think I have an issue with IBS since my cramps wake me up at night: also, I have some other non gastro things going on that my doctor said may indicate autoimmune disease but my cdc was within range so im not sure. 

I eat a fairly healthy diet, I've recently switched to blending all my fruits/veggies to make them easier to digest, I exercise 5 times a week, and I try to log food and bathroom habits to pick out trigger foods to eliminate. I've been doing a ton of research to see if my lifestyle is part of the problem because I want to get better so badly. If anyone has input it is greatly appreciated!

I get the results back and they diagnosed me with ""stercoral colitis."" The only thing they say to do is to avoid constipation and take miralax every morning and night. I've been taking it almost every night and it seems now my system is thrown off. I didn't ever consider that I was constipated before the diagnosis but now it seems like I have to take something in order to ""go."" The bleeding has also not stopped.

And especially after a few weeks of my infusion to maybe right before the next one I get serious joint pains all over my body randomly. It leaves one place and goes to another. Totally random. It stops me from doing basically anything, can’t go to the gym..can barely go outside when it’s really bad.

I know arthritis is common in people with UC, and if it’s that I’m glad it usually doesn’t cause long term damage. Idk if that’s what this is (it seems very..very likely it is though) but I’m scheduling an appointment with a rheumatologist tomorrow.

I only take remicade now, haven’t been on prednisone for almost a year now.

My question is, for those that suffer from this. How do you deal with it? Any remedies?

I’ve been having trouble sleeping so my bed time is usually 4 am lol. So I’ll be changing that and eating better from now on. I’m wondering what else you do besides good sleep and good diet. And if good diet what foods do you eat and which you avoid.

Thank you!

I have been having worsening liquid/watery diarrhea over the past year or so. Right now its 3-5 rounds of diarrhea a day, usually after I eat breakfast and have my coffee, then its done after a couple hours. Still very inconvenient and hard to make it to work on time and do other stuff with spending so much time on the toilet.

Also, I have tenesmus every couple months. I have realized that this is often triggered by insoluble fibre, specifically wheat bran as it happens when I had bran flakes, other whole wheat cereal, or to much wheat bread. Stress also seems to play a factor in the tenesmus.

The diarrhea itself doesn't look bloody - it is brown-orange usually. By the end of a bad bout of tenesmus though I am bleeding quite a bit but unsure if thats from the colon or more likely from the rectum itself (bright red drops of blood coming out, possibly hemmorhoid or fissure?)

I saw a GI yesterday and he said my symptoms are consistent with UC and scheduled a colonoscopy to check which is in a month. I thought with UC I would also have weight loss, bloating/abdominal discomfort etc.   I really have no other symptoms, I generally feel fine except for the inconvenience of the diarrhea and fear of pooping my pants.

I had posted this a few weeks ago in this group and received a good response! Thank you to all of those who have already contributed to/shared my study. However, I am still looking for a few more women who would be willing to participate. I look forward to hearing back! Here is the description of the study below:

I am currently working on a research study (study # 002078) at the University of South Florida. The purpose of this research study is to better understand how communication plays a role in shaping identities and relationships after an Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) diagnosis and the role food plays in exposure of an IBD diagnosis. I am most concerned with situations in which we are exposed as living with IBD and how those exposures affect identities and relationships with family, friends, and significant others. I am also curious as to what exposes us a living with IBD.

To explore this, I am looking for women that have been diagnosed with a form of IBD (either Crohn’s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis or Microscopic Colitis) for at least 1 year and are between 18-40 years of age. For the research study, I would meet with the participants for anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours for a one-time interview during the duration of the study. The meetings will be held virtually via Skype or Zoom depending on the participant’s preference. Participants may benefit in terms of support for their illness through the interview and from the principal investigator (Jessica Lolli). Participants will also be directed to resources for support should they choose to do so. There is no compensation for participating in this study.

If you know of anyone who may be interested in participating in this study, please have them direct message or email Jessica Lolli. My email is [jlolli@usf.edu](mailto:jlolli@usf.edu).",2021-06-09 12:54:47

I have Proctitis, which my specialist explained is UC in the rectum -  fortunately it's on the least-serious end of the spectrum - and is unlikely to creep up the GI tract. He also noted some diverticular disease a bit further up the sigmoid colon.

I've been consulting Dr Google - NIH, GOV, and EDU websites mainly, to get a better understanding of what I can expect.

Specialist has me on a course of oral mesalazine, tapering off at the moment, but he's also given me prescriptions for mesalazine suppositories, and Augmentin Duo for the diverticular disease. He said to taper off the oral medication, and see how I felt. If I didn't feel comfortable with the progress of recovery, still experiencing symptoms, etc, I should hit the suppositories and antibiotics.

I had an endoscopy at the same time, because there was an issue with reflux from a couple of years ago, and I'm taking a PPI (Atacand) to deal with that, and he said the damage to my eosophagus has completely healed, which is great news.

I'm contemplating what to do when the oral mesalazine runs out. I haven't seen any blood since very early on in the treatment, but I'm still experiencing 3 - 4 bowel movements a day. #1 is like it used to be before all this, within 30 minutes of getting vertical in the morning, there's a bulky, effortless movement. Subsequent visits are small, urgent, and 5-6 on the Bristol Scale. There's also a LOT of gas - not stinky, just a lot of it. I think the change in bowel pH from the PPI has somehow made for a more favourable environment for certain bacteria.

I've been on low-fibre, low-residue diet for a while and recently started getting back to my regular diet, and I've identified some ""trigger"" foods which seem to upset things in the lower GI, so I'll have to learn to avoid them.

A couple of questions:

1. Does r/IBD have a wiki or links to some good resources?
2. I love kimchi, I make my own, is there any sort of consensus on whether it's good or bad for UC?",2021-06-09 04:53:44

First I did prednisone, than budesonide, which didn't really help. I guess I'm sort of a off the curve case, since I don't have diarrhea, and most of the lymphocytes are around my ileum.  
So my GI has been treating me more like I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, he keeps saying ""don't worry, your colitis is microscopic, it's nothing to worry about"", which sounds really weird to me.  
So I've seen a new GI and he's thinking of trying mesalamine, since I still get a lot of pain and swelling (I've seen simmilar descriptions mostly from Small bowel Crohn's patients). But here's the thing. The more I research I do, the more I find (1) people with Microscopic Colitis being successfully treated with it and (2) research stating that actually mesalamine is no more effective than placebo.

So... what's the deal there? Anyone with MC can enlighten me on this? Have you had good experiences with Lialda and such? Or is this in the past now?

I'm just wondering what they're looking for, in my mind it seems like it's either IBS or IBD but maybe that's too narrow minded. It seems like pus, blood and inflammation isn't common for IBS, but maybe hemerroids or a fistula or something is causing that?

She is now becoming nauseous and feels the need to vomit even though she hasn’t eaten anything. she hardly makes it to the toilet because her stomach is really upset we have taken her to the hospital and they just said it’s diarrhoea and send her home but I’m starting to think it maybe irritable bowel syndrome or something else along those lines and I was wondering if anyone here could help me with the symptoms that she’s having and do I need to take her back to the hospital because she hasn’t been able to eat in over a week and a half and is still having diabolical diarrhoea.

1734,Is this normal?,ImpertinentFarmer,13,o1lvbo,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/o1lvbo/is_this_normal/,12,"I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (proctitis) late last year. Which wasn't happy news but a bit of a relief because I've been filling up my toilet with blood for years and - more recently - being brought to my knees with intense stomach pain that lasts for hours. I was hoping this could mean an end to all of that.

However, I was only medicated once by someone other than my usual health practitioner for it early this year and then once by my own after telling my usual health practitioner I've been bleeding and experiencing intense pains still. 

My health practitioner is understandably reluctant to provide the same medication because of its possible ill effects so I haven't been medicated for the majority of this year. She told me months ago that  I would have to wait a few months to see a specialist who will be able to medicate me or see what's necessary. But I rarely pass stool, just blood and mucus, and when I do the stool is black and covered in mucus and blood. I'm experiencing discharge that's mixed with blood when I'm going about my day which I don't enjoy. I can't always control my bowel movements either. I barely have energy, probably because of the blood loss, despite taking iron supplements to make up for it. The pain isn't fun but not as disconcerting as the blood loss and not being able to move.

My health practitioner doesn't seem concerned by any of this which makes me think this is normal for people with UC. I've waited six months for the appointment, which is soon finally, but is this normal for UC? I don't have anyone to talk to about what to expect with this condition and what I should seek help for. I'd appreciate any advice or information.",2021-06-17 04:13:23

At first my doctor completely ignored my symptoms said it's all in my head! Which was pretty annoying. Long story, short, it got really bad, so he asked for a colonoscopy. Turned out, my disease has advanced from ""mild"" to ""very severe"" he couldn't even get a whole colonscopy because of how bad the inflammations were, so he told me he couldn't get deeper into the colon, because he was scared of opening them. 


I was then put on steroids. I've had this disease for almost ten years now, failed so many meds, my most recent was Xeljainz (that surprisingly gave me amazing calproctectin results even during the time, I was practically dying from pain). I was taking 60mg of cortiscione for 3 weeks, bleeding didn't stop, pain and cramps never went away, and bathroom became more awful than it usually was, black stool, no sleep, lost around 10 kgs, maybe a bit more. 


So, three days ago, I was admitted to the hospital, right now I'm on a course of hydrocortisone (300mg/6hours) some type of antibiotics? And painkillers (that absolutely does nothing but they refuse to give me stronger ones). I forgot to mention, I'm also on stelara!!!



At this point, I don't really care if I get better or anything, I just want to do the surgery so bad. I don't want to deal with the disease anymore even if I managed to achieve remission, the idea of it coming back again to this point is scary, and it's annoying. I've had enough of the drugs, enough of the pain and the bleeding. I want a normal life! I have a final in one day, and I'm trying too hard to balance everything and study, it's hard and tiring, but I can't postpone the final!!! I can't let this disease beat me no matter what! I've been with it for so long and now it's never time to give up, at this point, it's either me or my colon in this body. I don't have the energy anymore and surgery is literally the only thing I think about at this moment. 



Sorry for the really long rant ): I needed to vent so much and I didn't know a better place to do it than here. I know I may sound dramatic and alot of people have it worse than me probably! I give you my word, you're all warriors and all amazing!",2021-06-18 05:30:56

1744,Undiagnosed after Urgent Care. Pressure left side of abdomen. Wait for specialist or ER?,m7e3d1,5,o3azlo,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/o3azlo/undiagnosed_after_urgent_care_pressure_left_side/,15,"Hey all, I began having some abdominal discomfort in the beginning of May, mostly a mild upset stomach with frequent mild-ish nausea. I would also have 5 to 6 bowel movements a day, whereas 1 to 2 were usually the norm for me. My stools have also been thinner than usual, but no diarrhea. I'm a 31 year old male, in decent shape but with a terrible diet (too much fast food).

Things really ramped up 10 days ago... I went for a run and during the run felt pain in the left side of my abdomen. The pain stuck around for a few days and then got bad enough for me to head to urgent care, not because I was in severe pain but because it was enough for me to know that this isn't normal at all. I would characterize my more recent symptoms (last 10 days) as a feeling of constant pressure on the left side of my abdomen and a feeling of ""heaviness"" in that spot. These symptoms can feel almost non existent in the morning or when I'm laying in bed. About 2 of the last 10 days I've had episodes where I've been in actual pain in that region. Not very sharp pain but just achy and kind of dull, and enough to ruin most of that day and not be able to work. There is no pain to the touch; I can press around my abdomen without any discomfort and I'm able to pass stool relatively normal, aside from it still being slightly thinner than usual.

My urgent care doctor did a blood and urine test, and also ordered an abdominal ultrasound. Everything came back normal. He did suggest I see a gastroenterologist and that it might be IBS, but it's been a nightmare finding one on a short notice. For now, I booked an appointment in 3 weeks.

My concern is (ahem, *Google*) that this might be serious enough for me to have a more immediate diagnosis rather than waiting 3+ weeks to see a specialist. I've read all sorts of things, with IBD, colon cancer, and an obstruction being the most alarming. I currently feel fine with no pain and with the aforementioned symptoms still present. I did have a bad day yesterday with pain (one of those 2 previously mentioned days) and I'm feeling a bit paranoid/anxious about this situation not having gone away after 10 days.

Has anyone here experienced anything similar in regards to my symptoms? This is all new to me. At this point I'd be happy to hear it's just IBS and nothing more serious. But I'm also wondering if I should be in the ER instead of waiting for my appointment with the gastro. What I've read on the permanent damage that IBD can cause has me on edge a bit, assuming it's IBD related to begin with. For now, I've stopped any strenuous physical activity and have also been eating light and clean, mostly liquids (water and those Ensure shakes).

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

**TLDR:** Abdomen pressure/heaviness on the left side after going for a run 10 days ago. Some days with pain, enough to affect my day. Mild abdominal discomfort started in early May. Is this a medical emergency? Urgent Care visit came out clean (blood/urine/ultrasound). Specialist scheduled in ~3 weeks.",2021-06-19 10:00:03

I am a 21 year old female who has dealt with IBS-D flare ups pretty much her whole life (frequent bowel movements, urgency, cramping with lasting back and pelvic pain, and bleeding episodes). The last few years these symptoms have been increasingly worse and now affect my daily life. I am going to grad school to become a plant geneticist and spend a lot of time in fields far away from bathrooms which has really sucked :( . I pretty much survive off of pepto bismol which doesn't always work.


I recently got in touch with a GI specialist after going to the ER for a bleeding episode. We ran blood tests and found that my CRP level was 16 mg per liter. My mom (a GI nurse) and her doctor were certain I had colitis or chrons. I had a upper endoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies (chrons, colitis, celiac) and everything came back normal. :( Now the GI department won't take me seriously and just tells me to take over the counter medicine. I am looking for advice on what I should do and if I should continue pursuing this. The fact that my CRP level is so high is terrifying me as well since it wasn't linked to a colon related disease. I am also scared that this will prevent me from continuing a career that I am very passionate about. Has anyone else gone through similar experiences?",2021-06-21 20:16:47

25y, male living in Qld Australia.

&#x200B;

Thanks to anyone who reads this - I will try to keep it brief but here is a post in /r/ibs \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/IBSResearch/comments/l4emxe/my\_ibs\_journey/gkx40pz/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBSResearch/comments/l4emxe/my_ibs_journey/gkx40pz/?context=3) which has a more detailed outline prior to my last test. 

&#x200B;

Been sick for about 2 years now, constant nausea, abdo pain, ed emissions, constipation, horrible lower back pain, and muscle aches, lost 20kg over the 2 years.

&#x200B;

I can't do anything that requires exertion or gets my heart rate up (eg last night I did the equivalent of a 300m run and spent the next hour trying not to vomit) but I work full time in IT, have a wife and 2 little kids so I have to work very hard to maintain a level of ""normal"" for my family - but it definitely takes a toll on me when I can't run around with my little 3yo boy ahhh.

&#x200B;

After almost 2 years of no definitive test results, last week I finally had a stool test come back with a Calprotectin level of 86 and have been referred back to the hospital specialist. I live in Australia and am just waiting to see what classification I receive, it will either be a 1-month wait to see a specialist or 3 months + then another 1 or 3 months to get a test depending on the subsequent classification.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice for me? Should I get my hopes up that maybe this means IBD (not that it's good but at least there are options, at the moment nothing helps) and we can actually start treating it or is a level of 86 nothing to get excited about?

&#x200B;

Thanks so much

Have had IBS-C for 30+ years. I don't take meds for it. Tried one once but it gave awful side effects.

I have bipolar 2, ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder so I'm on enough meds already anyway.

I try to drink water - it's hard. I'm not a big fan. Same with exercise. In fact, I just began exercising again 2 weeks ago before all hell broke lose.

I began taking Dr. Schulze's Intestinal Formula about 2 years ago. I began having bowel movements daily! 

If I don't drink enough water and/or take the pills, I pay for it.

10 days ago I began having diarrhea. It stopped a few days ago but the lower GI cramping, the bloating, gas....MIND BENDING.

I couldn't bear it anymore so I went to the ER yesterday.

A CatScan revealed colitis in my sigmoid. I was referred to a GI and will go in 2 days.

Meantime, I've done some reading and the descriptions of MC sound *exactly* like what's been going on.

 Symptoms:

Weight loss (not much but since eating = pain...weight loss)

Belly pain

Bloating

Dehydration (diarrhea! And eat/drink = pain...so dehydration)

Nausea

Fatigue or weakness

Not being able to control a bowel movement

 
I know lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis are 2 types of microscopic colitis and that lymphocytic colitis is more common in older women...raises hand.

What I've been reading is disheartening. Uninformed doctors. Meds with lots of side effects. 

I'm lactose intolerant. I avoid dairy or take lactase pills when I can't.

I've tested negative for celiac.

I don't smoke or drink.

Meds I'm prescribed are the only ones I take.

They will last around a minute at a time and can be quite painful and then pass.

 I was diagnosed with colitis 4 years ago and had two flare ups within the first year but nothing since. I’ve not really had any symptoms or pain up until around Christmas time this year, since when it’s been quite regular.

Been a bit of a slow process trying to get anything medical done in the uk during lockdown etc. But all blood tests/stool tests I’ve done have shown no indication of a flare up and I’m not having any other symptoms/losing weight or anything. The only other real issue is tiredness- I work full time and feel absolutely wiped when I get in from work, nap in the evening and then sleep for 8 hours or so a night. 

Anybody had any experience of this when not flaring and anyone have any suggestions? Ive taken buscopan and simeticone which seem to make a bit of difference but not enough to stop the regular cramps. I also went gluten free for a month but noticed no difference.

I’m just after some advice and some of your experiences with Infiximab if anyone is happy to share. I was diagnosed with UC in January and had a bad flare in April that led to steroid treatment. That really seemed to solve my issues but another recent flare has prompted my IBD team to recommend switching to the immunosuppressant infliximab as my maintenance drug. I’m really concerned about making this move. My symptoms seem to be heavily diet related as both flares followed immediately after consuming what I know to be triggers. They’ve restarted the steroid course to try and get things under control and I’m really reluctant to move into immunosuppressants as my maintenance drugs as I am hugely concerned about side effects. How do you all find Infliximab? Does it help? Are the significant side effects? Thanks in advance.,2021-06-25 17:00:20

I recently moved to a place and immediately got problems with my stomach and haven't had problems before. It started with going to the toilet right after meals. But I didn't really pay much attention to it. Then it escalated and got severe pain in lower-right stomach for 3 days and had troubles standing up. And it reminded me of broken appendix when googling. Then it suddenly was gone and good. Then it came back some week later and loose stool with pain.

Then for some reason I thought it was something with the water. It felt greasy. So I tried only doing bottled water for 1 week. It was pretty good. Then I tried tap water and had severe pain immediately with 3 loose stools within 30 minute and total of 13 loose stools for 2 days and blood in it. Stopped with crane water immediately after and bottled water again for 1 week. Stomach got better after 2 days with bottled water. Maybe 1 loose stool and some pain. Then after 1 week I tried tap water again and had same reaction as before with many loose stool with blood.

Asked them to take test on the water but they found nothing. Doctors took test and my fecal protein showed 5000+ with elevated CPR but found no parasite. They now sent me to do a colonoscopy .

I still think it was the water that caused it, but now when I try with bottled water it makes no difference. My theory is because my stomach now is so inflamed that it doesn't matter if I do tap water or bottled. Can they see or examine if there is a parasite or alike during a colonoscopy? I'm afraid that it is my water causing me issues without knowing it and still drinking it.",2021-06-26 10:49:02

From time to time, I get a 'flare up', where my bowels stop working. I end up even more bloated than usual (when a fat guy has a solid hard stomach, it's kinda odd). 

I then get 'the event', where... let's say it all starts working again. Can be a day of non-stop events, back and forth. It's awful, it's smelly (sorry) and messy (sorry), but by God it's a relief.

Today is that day. 

In addition to this, I get some kind of recurring abscess around rectum (not pilonidal, lower down). Mom had similar, and they operated to deal with her abscess / fistula; it was a massive failure, and she spent the rest of her life needing regular care to address it - no one's going near my ass with a knife. 

Had colonoscopy in the past (years, now) that read fine (but I'd argue, didn't occur anywhere near a flare up). 

I get pain in the right mid side (ileum - it's cramping as I sit here). 

Appreciate the rule on ""no diagnosis"", not looking for one, as I personally feel the severe psoriasis / abscess and bowel symptoms warrant further investigation - I guess my question is, how do you get a diagnosis with a flare-up condition? Just hope that recurrent flare-ups do enough damage to show up, outside of a flare up, and then show on inspection? How the heck I'd get put forward in COVID times is another issue (NHS).

Back in early 2019 during my first flare up, I was prescribed pred. This only started to work as I was finishing my final week on the drug, which I’ve since been told is longer than usual. It made me feel better, but it didn’t fully get me out of the flare. A few months later I was instead prescribed ‘Clipper’ steroids, which were wonderful because it was just one a day, and didn’t fuck with my moods. After about 2 weeks these worked wonderfully and put me in remission. 

Fast forward to May 2020 and I fell back into a flare up. I had to change doctor as I moved which delayed treatment massively leading me to get worse than ever before. Went through the whole rigmarole again, pred messed with me emotionally even worse this time and did nothing. Made no difference. Then I went on clipper, expecting to be temporarily cured. Instead there was a minuscule soothing of symptoms. I’ve had weeks during this flare up where I’ve been okay but by and large I’ve not really changed at all. I did take a shorter course of clipper again in the autumn but my pharmacy messed up and would only give me half a course so I couldn’t really tell if it would have helped.

For just over 5 months now I’ve been taking a small dose of Mercaptopurine and haven’t really noticed any improvements from that either. They’ve got to monitor my bloods to see if it’s harmful before they can up the dose but I’m getting impatient. I haven’t been able to work since graduating last year due to covid and my illness and I’m just getting scared I’ll never get any better.

I was diagnosed with IBD 16 years ago, which was a year after I got my wisdom teeth removed.  A few years later, I had to get two root canals - my two back molars on the left side. Neither my dentist nor my orthopedic surgeon asked why these two teeth needed root canals. One had a filling but the other died at the root. This makes no sense. \*Unless\* there is another infection! 3 specialist later, I found a holistic dentist that wasn't just recommending removing the root canals. He noticed a dark spot on my CT san that indicated that my wisdom tooth never healed!! 

He removed all the infection and the two teeth. This is the crazy part. The wisdom tooth on the left is connected to the Chinese meridian (as in acupuncture) that the colon is on. I don't believe this is a coincidence, especially because I was diagnosed so closely to the initial removal. 

I have been on Entivyo for 1.5 years and it has been slowly helping, but I had reached a plateau, until I started getting ozone injections in my jaw. Then, I saw improvement. It has only been three days since my surgery, but I believe this is the answer. I believe the endotoxins from the infection is causing my colitis. After 16 years of suffering, I have serious hope that I will get into remission!! 

When I asked how many people have infections and don't know it, my dentist said millions!  Most root canals are infected and regular dentists are taught to save the tooth no matter what. Teeth are so important to overall health. I hope to be a walking fucking billboard for this issue. Of course I am not suggesting that all UC patients have infected root canals, but the common denominator, I think, is endotoxins. And \*hopefully\* I have found the root cause of my IBD! I will update in a month when I get my colo. Thank you for reading my story!",2021-07-01 17:06:05

My symptoms started at the beggining of May, after covid and after a course of antibiotics for a tooth infection so my doctor thinks this is related. I'm afraid I have colon cancer but she thinks my chances of it are extremely low.

My symptoms are:

\- Going to the bathroom more often 2-5 times per day somedays, others just 1 or 2 times. 

\- Blood mixed/on the surface of stool, it is a really little amount.

\- Mild abdominal cramps 

\- I took a medicine for intestinal flora that my doc suggested for 10 days and my symptoms went away, no loose stool, no blood. 

\- I alternate between constipation/loose stool that come in tiny parts/almost diarrhea.

\- My sedimentation rate (that is a marker for inflammation) was 25 that apparently is slighly high

I have a colonoscopy in 5 weeks and I'm terrified of colon cancer but I'm not anemic or losing weight. Fiber tends to make me go to the bathroom waaay more.

In short, just received a calprotectin result of 86 (I know not that high but it was at least something medically credible) and not just me whinging saying how terrible I feel all the time. I was squeezed in for a second colonoscopy yesterday and my results are below.

&#x200B;

Any advice other than waiting 4 weeks for the follow-up and see if the biopsies return anything? Could I push for a small bowel scope if they have the technology at my hospital? Anything else I could ask my doctor to test me for?

I really thought this one would show something but now I am just really sore from the procedure and feeling a little defeated as it's yet another test with no definitive results :( (that is short of the biopsies returning microscopic colitis - unlikely considering I suffer mainly constipation and not diarrhea)

Hello, I'm 26 and I've had colitis for the past 6 years, I managed to get the inflammation down but it's pretty much impossible to gain weight or expand my abysmal diet, the next step that would potentially ""cure"" me is the removal of the colon. It's important to note that my liver suffered from the colitis and I may potentially have to get a transplant but if the colon isn't removed the liver will definitely need a transplant at a later time since we're talking about the primary  sclerosing cholangitis and there is also the threat of colon cancer which is growing with time.

Until I showed her 6 pictures of my blood stained toilet, she then urgently referred me. 

But April, got hospitalised the whole shebang, you know how that goes. Good ole camera up the ass, told I have UC which I suspected the entire time due to the heavy bleeding. Got put on 60mg pred, taper 5mg every 7 days and it worked a charm until I got down to 30mg where it just stopped working completely, I lost a lot of the weight I gained from pred(which I was really happy about because I was extremely underweight) and started bleeding and frequent pain again. They just put me on a higher dose of pred again. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, was put on Pentasa which only seemed to make things considerably worse, before the pain was maybe a 5, It wasn't nice but I could ignore it and carry on with what I was doing most the time. Now it's easily a 7-8, whenever it happens I have to stop whatever it is I'm doing and focus on powering through the pain. It gets so bad sometimes I'm on my knees punching the floor to try and take the pain away from my intestines. Luckily the pain only last for 2-3 minutes so I just have to knuckle through. I asked my GI about pain relief and he just said to take paracetamol, which does absolutely fucking nothing because it's not going to scratch a 7-8 pain at all. 

I did want to ask about stronger painkillers(codeine, etc.) But from what I've seen opioids do nothing but cause more issues for us, due to them slowing down your gut, etc. But they're really the only ""strong"" painkillers around, or am I mistaken? Is there possibly anything else I can do to help out my pain? Diet changes pretty much do nothing for me. I smoke weed but I'm in college with no job so it's not like I can be smoking it very often, but it did provide good pain relief for me. Is there anything else I can do? Because Idk if I can take this much longer, but my GI doesn't want to put me on biologics yet if the pentasa has a chance of working because I'm ""young"" (his words) but until that point, I NEED some form of pain relief. 


TL;DR: What can I do for my 7-8 scale pain? Paracetamol doesn't scratch it, and from what it seems opioids just cause us lot issues, or should I maybe ask for them anyway? Weed is too expensive to be smoking 24/7 and it's illegal here, so I can't be high all the time anyway. What the hell can I do because I cannot take this much longer.",2021-07-03 16:30:21

- I wouldn't necessarily call it diarrhea but i often have loose stool that ive never found the right words to describe, it looks like it didn't compact together like it should if that makes any sense. Its never been so bad as so that i was worried i would go in my pants. This is why i always figured it wasn't ibd since every story I've heard about that involves diarrhea. 

- When my symptoms are at their worst i have awful constipation and it feels like my entestines are... tight. I can barely even pass gas, and when I try to go to the bathroom it feels like my anus is prolapsing. (I tried ""digital stimulation"" hoping it would help and my anus was extremely tight and my rectum felt ""off"" as well there was a lot of mucus present) at one point i though i crapped my pants but it was just a large glob of mucus with bright red blood in it (this is the only time ive seen blood)

-constant passing of gas and belching to help with discomfort, acid reflux aswell.

I've been struggling with the disease itself for over 3 years, but have only been diagnosed now due to the crazy waiting lists of the NHS, and a lack of being taken seriously until my symptoms worsened (sever fatigue, blood in stool, constant severe pain, liquid diarrhea over 15 times a day). 

I was given steroids to treat the inflammation. They worked fine at first, but once the dose was gradually reduced to 15mg (from 40mg), all of my old symptoms came back. I was given IV steroids, then put on oral steroids again (same dose, 40 and decreasing each week).

Now, I'm on 20mg, and they have stopped working again. However, I have been approved for Humira injections which will be shipped out to me within the next two weeks or so.

However, for context, I am a student doing A Levels (further education after high school). I was behind from the start due to COVID interrupting my GCSEs, and the fact that my school only offered Double Award Science rather than the Triple Award everybody else in my new school took. I also missed months of school at a time due to my flareup. Any grades I got this year don't count due to COVID, meaning that my final A Level grade depends entirely on next year.

I'm still behind, and I want to make sure that I am in remission for my final year, since otherwise, I would still be in the middle of starting my new medication when the school year starts, and I would already be under so much stress and pressure.

I considered, and was recommended to take next year off entirely, and return to finish my studies the year after. I could take this time to recover, catch up on my studies, and enjoy my life stress free.

But as people with crohn's and your own struggles with school, what do you think about this idea? Please tell me your advice and experiences, if you have any to share ❤️ Thank you very much, and wishing anyone reading this the best in your journey and recovery.",2021-07-08 23:29:40
1859,"Post-diagnosis, Pre-doc tips?",resemi99,6,oggqh3,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/oggqh3/postdiagnosis_predoc_tips/,12,"Hey all! I had a colonoscopy in May as a result of significant pain in my left flank and abdomen. (I’ve had symptoms like diarrhea, fatigue, blood in stool, rectal pain, frequent fevers and aches, etc. for awhile). The doc finally called me with biopsy results after a month because it went to the wrong doc. He said there was active inflammation and wanted me to see a specialist to determine between Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis. (I did not have a GI before the colonoscopy). He said to see them within 2 weeks and he’d help set it up. 

Long story short, both my colonoscopy doc and the specialist left the practice and the first available with someone else was mid august. That already sucked, but they called last week and said they overbooked that day and I’m now end of September.

My question is, anything I can do in the interim to help with symptoms? The pain, bloating, and burning in my stomach are the worse symptoms. The flank pain feels like pressure and deep ache. I keep track of everything I eat and try to be mindful of what is making things worse, but I’m very new to this, don’t have a doctor yet to talk to, and feel like I’m in limbo.

As an aside, I’m fully vegetarian and most always vegan.

Fast forward to now. My husband's company got bought out and our insurance changed, and there was an issue with cost of the mesalamine. I went without it for 7 days and started having symptoms, really bad stomach pains, fatigue, bathroom probably 10x a day, loose stools, the whole 9 yards. I haven't missed a dose of my entyvio and I get it every 6 weeks. The fact that I stopped the lialda and symptoms returned makes me think the entyvio isn't working for me. I never knew what truly put me in remission because I was pregnant and on 3 different medications. Does anyone have any insight to this for me?

I’ve been diagnosed with ibs and Ehlers-danlos syndrome and have always had gut problems but pretty mild and also my grandma had colitis. But in the last 2 months I can’t eat anything without feeling so so unwell and it came on pretty suddenly. I’m having constant diarrhea literally every day , way more joint pain that usual, lower right stomach pain that hurts to push on, feeling so dizzy and weak, fatigued and feeling like I might be sick and nausea. This is all after I eat. Sometimes within a couple mintutes of a meal I feel this coming on. My stomach starts making so so much noise, hurting and I have to go and lay down or run to the bathroom.

Ive been losing so much weight and im to tired/ in pain to do much at all. Its making me so miserable. My doctor has really fucked me about claiming its just ibs and also blamed my ritalin which i had to come off for 2 weeks (it made not difference) so ive asked to change. Ive had ibs all my life and its never been this bad and its usally when im stressed and im ok atm. I cut out dairy and gluten and this didnt change anything. I have had blood test which came back normal and just did a stool sample but its all taking so long and its hard to get a doctors appointment atm. I really just want to know what it is so I know what im up against. Just wondering if this sound similar to anyones experiance? And wondering how long it took to get diagnosed.

At 14 I took antibiotics for acne. Immediately developed bowel symptoms (pain, constant nausea, developed lactose intolerance) and was diagnosed with IBS.

At 17, it worsened. Passing lots of mucus, bright yellow diarrhea, pain, constant nausea, passing undigested food, etc. Stool and blood tests came back normal.

At 18 it hit rock bottom, I constantly vomited for 2 weeks straight, lost 3 stone in a month and was admitted to hospital. Ultrasound, bloods and stool were clear except for fatty liver syndrome likely from rapid weight loss (8+ stone in 2 years).
Had endoscopy a month later which was clear but developed black stools & extreme pain after, it went away eventually. They come back after exercise/exertion. Stool showed no blood.

At 19 during COVID, my symptoms suddenly got worse and couldn’t tolerate food at all. Lost a lot of weight rapidly and was so ill I couldn’t get out of bed. By March 2021 I was so unwell I couldn’t walk and was admitted. Ultrasound, bloods and stool were clear again. Calprotectin was ever so slightly raised and bloods only showed moderate malnutrition. 
I’m deficient in:
- Vit A & D
- Selenium
- Protein
- Albumin
They’re adamant it’s psychological. Had a CT scan a few months ago without contrast (allergies) and showed nothing significant. Due a flexible sigmoidoscopy soon (god only knows when, thanks covid) but I’m so unwell again. I was supposed to be tube fed in hospital but refused but now wish I did because I can’t sustain myself nutritionally. My albumin is very low and I’m so weak I can’t do anything but stay in bed. The nausea is horrific and constant. Most of my hair has fallen out.

Alongside the bowel symptoms I get:
- Sore, gritty eyes
- Painful joints
- Lower right pain which moves to my shoulders during a flare
- Rashes
- Mouth ulcers 
- Severe bloating to the point of breathlessness 

If my tests are clear but I have most IBD symptoms, what on Earth am I supposed to think? My GI doc says it’s severe IBS. At what point is is NOT classed as IBS because I’ve never known IBS to completely disable someone the way it has me. I can only eat rice cakes, and I’m done.

At the end of my tether. Any advice would be welcome.

EDIT: should also mention that bowel problems run in my family, we have Crohn’s and UC. Also have upper right quad pain, upper left pain after eating something fatty. Gallbladder and pancreas are fine too apparently.",2021-07-13 18:09:59

Post-colonoscopy & biopsy,headofachicken,2,okj9a3,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/okj9a3/crohns_or_uc_postcolonoscopy_biopsy/,8,"I just had my first colonoscopy last week after years on on and off diarrhea, abdominal cramping, joint pain, mucus in stool, but no visible blood (dark diarrhea occasionally). My doctor saw what he described as “patchy colitis” with scattered ulcers throughout my entire colon but worse on the right side (I have the colonoscopy pics but didn’t want to post in case they’re too graphic 😬). My terminal ileum appeared normal, though, and the best portions of my colon were the sigmoid and rectum based on appearance and the presence of ulcers. After the colonoscopy, my doctor said he was almost positive I had Crohn’s but needed the biopsy results to confirm. 

My doctor also took some tissue samples to biopsy, and the results just came back tonight. All of the four areas he took specimens from (ascending, transverse, and descending colon and rectum) showed “severely active chronic colitis/proctitis with ulceration.” I read that Crohn’s often involves the terminal ileum and UC involves the rectum but not the rectum so wondering if I might have UC instead?

Also, my doctor took at least two samples from each area (10 in total) and all came back as showing colitis so not sure if that means my entire colon is inflamed, like with UC, even though the visible ulcers were in patches.

1923,Seeking advice/experience during diagnosis,Ecstatic-Attitude-73,4,olo9bf,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/olo9bf/seeking_adviceexperience_during_diagnosis/,5,"As the title suggests, looking to not feel totally lost in my journey. To caveat, I am in the process of seeking medical diagnosis, but gaining education / what’s normal has been non existent from my doctor. 

Back story:  30, F, been on BC since 16.  Had zero IBD symptoms until a recent travel/hospital visits. Traveled for a staycation and while at the airport had a salad with chicken/ wine — boarded the flight and an hour in experienced what felt like intense bloating/gas pains.  During that week, I had what felt like period cramps on/off. But no diarrhea, no blood, no mucous, no issues with eating/drinking. Slight constipation (which happens when I travel). 

Fast forward, get back home. I’m still having random pains (they last for 3 seconds), but double me over. Call a tele doc and they prescribe Meloxicam, which I’m on 6/19 and 6/20.  6/20 — I go into the ER because now I have a fever. End up being admitted because my HR won’t drop below 140 bpm.  During this time, they do a CT scan and diagnosis infectious colitis and begin administrating BOTH cipro and flagyl (on these from 6/22-6/24). At this point, this is when my body deteriorated. While my Heart rate dropped to under 100, I begin to have severe diarrhea, complete with blood. Drs say, it’s normal.  They discharge me. 

I stayed on the antibiotics at home, but my bowel movements got worse. I was going almost every hour/2 hours. The smell of food made me violently ill (yay for popping blood vessels in your face when puking!). It got so bad, I could only get out of bed to rush to the bathroom. 

Check back into the ER on 6/25 and stopped taking my antibiotics. Almost immediately, the diarrhea chills out. They put me in for another CT and colonoscopy.  CT now shows a more inflamed colon (shocker) and post getting out of the colonoscopy, the GI says, ‘you likely have UC’ — I start crying and and then he just walks away (the most callous way to tell someone they have a disease IMO).  Hospital gives me extra potassium and sends me on my way with Prednisone 40mg till I get in to my local GI (this is scheduled! But drs take forever to get in).  

Fast forward, the Prednisone 40mg helped in 1 week to get me down from 3-4 bowel movements to 1-2 that are Bristol 4. 

I receive the hospitals pathology report, which reads: A. RANDOM COLON, BIOPSIES:
-Diffuse moderate chronic active colitis with erosions, cryptitis and crypt abscesses. -See comment.
 MComment: The changes seen could be compatible with inflammatory bowel disease. The differential diagnosis includes chronic medication effect and infection. Clinical correlation required.

There is colonic mucosa showing diffuse acute and chronic inflammation in the lamina propria. Multiple glands show cryptitis and several crypt abscesses are seen. There are a few branched glands. No granulomas or dysplasia seen on the sections reviewed. Erosion is identified.

I then received the hospital GI’s ‘official’ biopsy results back in the mail and it said, ‘not polyps, the biopsy was normal.’ 

Y’all. I am so confused and am trying to keep myself out of the void of despair.  A lot of this came out of left field (I know that can happen) and I’ve been trying to scan for similar stories, but I’m raking my brain at how this all got diagnosed. 

Any help in deciphering the diagnosis process (is it normal to get a ‘normal’ biopsy but pathology reads differently) and am I crazy for thinking a mistreatment with the antibiotics caused gut dysbiosis? 

Again, I’m seeing a new GI soon, but the waiting is hard when I have so much conflicting information.",2021-07-16 21:35:17

I've been going to a walk-in so I saw a different doc the next time who said IBD is still possible despite normal blood tests, and put in a referral to a GI for a scope.

It's coming up on 2 months that I've been having symptoms, but it's so much better now. I'm only going 6-10x a day compared to 25-30x. Able to eat, diarrhea is more solid, and the bleeding is really minimal just off and on.  Figured I'd ask you guys!

* If it is IBD, wouldn't it be getting worse instead of better? I'm only taking Imodium
* Do you basically have to be in a flare for them to see anything in a scope, or would they still be able to see something despite symptoms improving? I kinda feel like just not going through with it since I doubt they'll find anything.
* This also all started a week after my first covid shot, so I wonder if its all just a one time immune response?

Anyway, for some reason I thought it was the water that caused all this. I've always got a sensitive stomach but this was something new. What I find fascinating with the healthcare is how little they care about the cause of things. 

So I asked my municipality for a water test for my tap water. Copper was above the limits. But the way they tested it was wrong. She let the water run for a minute even for the unspoiled water. And it turns out it was even higher than theirs (around 0.7 mg/l) when done correctly. Copper cause huge issues with your stomach. My stomach immediately got a lot better when I stopped drinking. But I still suffer from it and afraid my stomach is so ruined and inflamed that it won't be able to heal. 

What I wanted to say; Please check your environment and especially water. Especially if you live in an old house with old pipes. A lot of stomach diseases and issues actually comes from there and it is so under reported. They don't even mention it as a possibility anywhere when you search for IBD or stomach issues.

NOTE: This is from a Nordic country with some of the best water in the world where everyone drinks tap water with regular tests yet there are issues.

My current doctor won’t give me anything for it except for Amitriptyline or harsh steroids that make me gain weight and give me other unpleasant side effects and then I feel the cure might be worse than the disease.  

Is my doctor being cautious because of a fear of me turning into a drug addict?  I understand that opiate meds can worsen things and make you constipated but I took mine when I needed to such as when I was experiencing horrible cramps and I never had bad constipation and I’m not sure why they’d give it to me in the hospital when I was super sick.

Is anyone taking anything for the pain that works with minimal side effects or has a doctor that lets them take something even like Tylenol with codeine?  It’s frustrating when you have a disease like this and are limited in what you can take.",2021-07-20 04:07:21

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but thought I would ask anyway. 

I'm currently in hospital with my son (11 YO). On Saturday we took him to A&E as he had blood in his stools and not just a little bit, it was mainly blood. This has been happening for 5 days now about 8 times a day. The doctors have done tests and have ruled out other things, they have also done an ultrasound and say they can see fluid? They're saying that it is highly likely to be IBD. I guess my question is do these symptoms sound like IBD to you and if so how long does this last? 

They going to discharge him while we get an appointment to see the specialist, but this is likely to take 4 weeks. He is in pain as he goes to the toilet and 4 weeks seems a very long time to wait. Has anyone else been in a simular position and know what to expect/anyway that I can help him?

Thanks


Update:

We have just returned from the colonoscopy, they have confirmed that he has IBD, they had to stop as it was too inflamed which suggests the UC type, but apparently that could change? They have given a lot of steroids and other medicine to take, 11 in total . They were really good and provided lots of information that we will read through with him once he has had some rest tomorrow. Thanks for the information everyone, I'm sure we will be quite active in this community as we learn more about IBD.",2021-07-21 18:11:09

I’ve been trying to diet and get fit, which was ok for a while, but every time I have a flare up I worry I’ll end up making it worse.

I have an urgent appointment coming up due to family history of IBD and elevated calprotectin levels. My symptoms are: lower left and lower right abdominal pain, sometimes lower left abdominal pain when walking / breathing deep, pain in rectum, anal fissures, fatigue, diarrhoea, mucus, stomach cramps, and arthritis (previously diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis.) Symptoms have come and gone for years but I’ve spent most of the last year in pain.

I feel somewhat in limbo currently as my GP said it’s likely IBD however further tests are needed through the gastro unit. Until then I’m not 100% sure what’s up and am on no treatment. I don’t know what might make it worse or better.

My main worry is the pain I get in my lower left abdomen with certain movements, which is especially worse during a flare up. I don’t want to be lifting weights and ending up injuring myself or making it worse!

Any advice on how you balance exercise with IBD symptoms?

I started having a really hard time passing stool July 2020. I felt as if my stool didn’t fit in my rectal canal. Fast forward to April 2021. I was supposed to get a colonoscopy but didn’t because the doctor realized I had an active fissure that was causing the muscles in my anal canal to tighten up which is what was causing the narrowing of the anal canal. He said that we would treat the fissure with lidocaine and nifedipine ointment. It worked and I even stopped using it. About a month ago I get completely constipated. I’ve suffered from constipation all my life but not like this. I took Linzess which usually makes me go and it did nothing. I went to the urgent care and was prescribed steroid suppositories to decrease the inflammation in my anal canal and it did nothing. I then tried steroid enemas and they didn’t work immediately like I thought they would. I needed to go to the bathroom but my stool couldn’t pass because my anal canal was really constricted. My stools were coming out thin and yellow, yet no blood. The only thing that allowed me to go to the bathroom was taking a laxative. I was so desperate and just wanted all the poop out of me since I had been constipated for 6 days, which caused tremendous inflammation in my stomach. It hurt to have all that poop inside of me. I’ve been better since but I still don’t go to the bathroom everyday, and have noticed that my rectal canal is still inflamed because when I use the lidocaine/nifedipine ointment it’s not as easy to insert as before. My gastroenterologist mentioned the possibility of chrons specially at my age but said we would look into that later on if problems persist. So far I’ve had these test done: endoscopy September 2020-everything normal except for a benign ulcer caused by a simple gastritis. FIT test October 2020- negative no blood in stool. Abdominal MRI April 2021-everything normal. I’m going to see my gastro again soon but wanted opinions. Thank you!",2021-07-23 06:12:18

No particular trigger I can identify. Between these episodes I have a few months to a year of normal-ish bowel movements with occasional disturbances. Initially I thought this was due to NSAID usage as I was taking quite a bit of ibuprofen for back pain so I ignored it the first few times it happened. When I mentioned it this concerned my GP as I had a slightly raised ESR (which he'd actually taken for the back pain) and my calprotectin came back as 302. Microbiology came back negative. 

Then I was referred to a gastroenterologist, but being the NHS it took a few months to get an appointment. By this time my symptoms had cleared up mostly, but they booked me for a sigmoidoscopy which was another month away. The sigmoidoscopy came back relatively clear (there was a mild change in granularity in one area) and so did the biopsies they took. I was discharged without any follow-up - the sigmoidoscopy results I just got in a letter and haven't spoken to anyone about it since. 

That was about a year and a half ago, and I think it's flared up about 3 times since then, each time for about a month at a time. I haven't touched NSAIDs in that period. Would my sigmoidoscopy come back clear if I had IBD but it wasn't flaring up at that point? Is it even possible for IBD to have that pattern of flaring up or is it more consistent?

I’ve had an endoscopy before, but the colonoscopy part is new to me.

However, I’ve run into a bit of a… situation.

So, I started my prep around 15 hours ago, but I’ve yet to poo. Actually, I haven’t been able to go since I started the low fiber diet. I’m not one who’s usually backed up (normally it’s the opposite — I go too frequently). I thought it was strange and wanted to take miralax over the weekend because normally I just need one 17g cap to get back on track, but I was worried that taking laxatives early would interfere with the mega poopening I was in for Sunday. 

Yet, nothing. My grocery store was out of dulcolax, so I ended up buying the store brand version, not realizing that they were 100mg soft gels instead of 10mg. Rip. I took one anyways at 3pm. Then, I took 6.5 scoops of Miralax (instead of the whole 8) because I was worried about combining both of them at such a high dosage of dulcolax (my doc had recommended only taking 10mg… this was 10x the dose). 

Still, nothing! By 8pm, I was feeling really light headed and tired, so I only took 1 cap of miralax. 

Got up around 1 am, nothing happened. Took 7 caps of miralax about an hour ago, still nothing! I’ve been drinking tons of fluids, didn’t have any solid foods. I don’t know what’s going on. 

I will say, I am a little scared of what might happen when it finally hits. Lol.

I haven’t been able to contact my doctor at all because it’s a weekend. I’ve tried calling the office multiple times to see if they have a weekend answering service, nope. I also haven’t been able to get a hold of billing, but that’s a whole other situation (they sent me an estimate that says the procedure will cost me $2,000+, even though I called my insurance and they said I should have no co pay). 

The office is closed for another 2 hours, so I won’t be able to call a doctor or nurse until then. Is this… normal? Is there anything I can do at this point, or anything they might be able to do for me when I get there (assuming I don’t have to reschedule)? 

Thank you for reading, I appreciate it. Wish me and my peaches luck. 

(P/S: I suspect that the low fiber diet threw me off because I’ve been vegan for about 3 or 4 years now. I’m not used to not eating fruits and vegetables, so I think the absence of them threw my bowels for a loop. 🥲😔😕)

(PP/S: I did drink a TON of fluid the entire time… still nothing, just pissing like a race horse)",2021-07-26 11:56:07

Needless to say I bounced back from the donuts on Sunday after an hour bike ride in the morning… but continued to be cocky and introduced the peanutbutter in my diet again.
It’s now Wednesday and I been passing blood since Monday morning. I messaged my doctor an told her about my experience and all she had to say was “up your fiber, talk to your GI specialist of symptoms continue”. But the thing is my GI hasn’t messaged me back in two months and they don’t answer or return my calls.
I have IBS A/M; and was prescribed Linzess but I don’t take it because it gives me explosive diarrhea. Anyway I decided to take some yesterday and that seemed to help clear me out an move things along; I go to sleep an can’t seem to stop passing blood and mucus every time I pass gas?? I wake up today and still the same story, more blood. It’s 10:00am now and I’m afraid to eat, I generally only eat in the evenings but sometimes I’ll eat in the mornings to move things. I’m in such a inflamed state I’m unsure of what to do? Should I fast? Or should I eat something along with some dietary fiber?

So I was meant to have the procedure done last week, I followed the prep instructions and ate low fibre then a clear liquid diet as suggested. But when it came to drinking the prep, I had moviprep, it took 6 hours for a bowel movement and it was pretty solid.

By the time of my appointment the next morning, I had a few more BM but not running clearish yet, the doctor still recommended I go in and attend the appointment. However the procedure was post-poned due to fecal matter still remaining in my bowels.

They finally figured out I needed my gullbladder removed. But after that things just went from bad to worse. Instead of back pain and heartburn every time I ate I started getting weak, cramps, sweaty, chills, diarrhea, and just plain miserable every time I put anything in my mouth. And it did not matter what it was. The doctors told my mom it was my diet, so we changed everything. Plain foods, bland foods, clear foods, soft foods, white foods, you think of every unappetizing diet that might not hurt your stomach and we tried it. But they never worked. My stomach still hurt. I could eat a carrot and get sick. Mashed potatoes with no butter, no milk, no salt, no pepper and get sick. I am 39 years old. I can eat something today and it will not bother me. I can eat the EXACT SAME THING tomorrow and I will live in my second bedroom for hours. There is no rhyme or reason for why my stomach hates me. They told my mom when I was a teenager that I have IBS. They put me on little blue pills that did not help but made me feel high and after months of dosage adjustments I stopped taking them. As an adult I get scoped every 5 years because they are sure I must have something else. But they never find anything. My mom has diviticulitis(sp) and my dad has had pulups off and on. Sometimes I am in the bathroom so long and it gets so bad my stomach bleeds, I also have an ulcer. Its not hemorrhoids, in case that's what your thinking because I never have to strain. Ok, so on to the actual point. I see all these ads for all these medications for IBS/IBD and they talk about how you may have it if you experience sudden weight loss. I have NEVER suddenly lost weight. I have suddenly gained weight. Plenty of times! I don't know if this is because when my stomach finally does calm down and I can leave my second bedroom I am starving because my body feels like it has rided itself with the last weeks worth of food. So I eat whatever is closest, and does not require me to cook. So usually a snack cake or a couple pieces of bread. Does everyone with IBS/IBD really loss weight or are there a lot more people like me who put on weight? I feel like maybe if I am the only one who doesn't loss than maybe I don't have IBS and if that's the case what the hell is wrong with me?!? 😭😷😬",2021-07-28 04:06:30

2. does colitis get worse in the future, or will it stay moderate. Right now, it hasn't really affected my life, but is there a good chance that it will in the future?
3. Does colitis always come back even after being in remission? or is there a possibility that you can be in remission forever?

I have been on weekly Humira for about 6 months after still having symptoms (though improvement) on bi-weekly Humira, and I'm doing great!. . .except my insurance company has denied my doctor's request for approval twice, saying that the FDA states that the guidance for weekly Humira is only if the patient meets the following two criteria:

1. They are in clinical remission on weekly Humira (I am)
2. They started taking Humira weekly prior to age 18 (I did not, as I was not diagnosed until I was 39).

I'm so upset, because I was so sick before we got on Humira, and prednisone made me better but completely insane. My doctor now says we can switch to Entyvio, but they have to start the whole prior authorization process, as well as the scheduling for the infusion center, all over again, and I'm very worried that there will be a gap in my treatment and I'll get sick again.

I guess my question is, has anyone else had this happen? My doctor's office reached out to the manufacturer of Humira to have them contact the insurance company as well, but I'm not optimistic that they'll be successful. My doc's office says this is the only plan she's ever heard of making this claim about the FDA approval for weekly dosing.

For anyone who has had to switch from a medication that was working to an unknown medication due to an insurance issue, how did it go? Was there a gap in your treatment and did you get sick again?

I came across a certain flapjack that has made my toilet visits regular again, I only have one every morning but my issue is relying on this. I’m not sure if this is a good thing long term and what negative affects it can give me. 

Apologies for my structure of my post, it’s been a while since I’ve written anything lol.

I’ve been having a mixture of gallbladder and digestive problems for well over 12 months now. 
Only digestive issues I’ve had prior to this was being Diagnosed with acute onset of ibs in 2016, that has flared on and off since. 

In 2020 I was taken in to hospital by ambulance and diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. I was in for 5 days, given 3 different lots of IV antibiotics and morphine. 
Since I was discharged From hospital in 2020 I’ve been having a number of bowel related symptoms that have increased in severity.

I have been back and forth to my GP with various symptoms like… pain in lower right abdomen, 
Blood in stools, fatigue, fevers, generally feeling unwell, intense daily nausea, headaches, joint pain, chronic diarrhoea, passing orange/maroon jelly like stuff. 

On two occasions this year the GP has sent me to a&e, because of the complaint of lower right quadrant pain they wanted to rule out appendicitis. A&e ran tests and I didn’t have appendicitis. 

In late April 2021 I was taken in to hospital again by ambulance, same thing again. Upper right quadrant and lower right quadrant pain. 
This time I had acute cholecystitis (no stones) as well as peritonitis. 
This was all shown on CT. I stayed in for 5 days and was told I would need to return as an out patient for cholecystectomy.. the specialists at the hospital also suspected something is going on with my bowels separate to the gallbladder issues so they said they would refer me to lower GI.

I’ve had 3 telephone appointment letters come through the post since, first one for 2nd sept 2021, this was cancelled by the hospital, second was for 23rd sept, again cancelled by hospital.. I now have a telephone appointment scheduled for 2nd December. 

I’m just wondering if anyone one else in the UK has experienced delays with appointments like this? 
I still haven’t had my gallbladder removed either. 

Just feeling very unwell all the time and frustrated with everything. 
For anyone with IBD that has also had gallbladder issues, did the symptoms overlap?

I have had a mass on my rectum for 5 weeks, I have seen my PCP, urgent care and the ER. I was told at first it was a hemorrhoid. After weeks of following directions for care there was no relief. Now I am being told it is a fistula. The fistula is discharging a yellow/green mucous. I am really frustrated and scared as I’ve been brushed off this whole time from all of those drs. I went to the dr again and demanded blood work. In the past week my symptoms have worsened. This morning i woke up soaked in sweat but felt fine otherwise. At night I get really fatigued, low grade fever (99-100), and now i am noticing I have not been eating as much as I normally do. Last night i had my favorite dinner meal and didn’t finish it. Im not sure if it is symptoms or anxiety for not knowing fully what is going on. My blood work came back normal except my SED rate is slightly elevated and I do have some inflammation. Dr said he wasn’t surprised since I do have this lesion (fistula) but the report was not all that helpful since the reading for SED rate was not very high. Suggested this could be IBD of some sort. I am not sure. Have never had gastro issues in the past, I don’t have stomach pains, I do not have diarrhea, I don’t have frequent urges to go to the bathroom. I am seeing a colorectal surgeon on Thursday for a consult but at this point I feel kind of hopeless. I know something is not right.

Even my friends and family can't relate to dealing with an autoimmune disease and the struggles with pain, diet, fatigue, extraintestinal symptoms, etc. How does one even approach meeting and pursuing a relationship?

I finally saw a GI who took me seriously and had the decency to listen. 

I’ve had ibs like symptoms for as long as I can remember. I’ve been tossed around to GI to GI - never had scopes done. No one listened and I was told I have “anxiety”. 

Sure, I may have some anxiety but it doesn’t leave me riddled with GI symptoms that can be absolute hell. I never had any blood in stools which is why I think I wasn’t taken seriously. 

I have psoriatic arthritis and celiac disease already. I take xeljanz 5mg 2x per day and religiously eat gluten free or there’s hell to pay. After I started xeljanz, my stomach issues lessened. My CRP and ESR are still elevated. My liver counts also improved. My rheumatologist asked me about my “IBS” and has grown suspicious I have a mild form of IBD. 

I saw GI and she also raised an eyebrow about xeljanz helping my IBS-D symptoms and urgency. She ordered a calprotectin test and is starting there. She said I could really go either way - IBS or what seems to be a mild IBD. 

I dropped off the sample today so I have a few days I assume prior to results. I’ve been fairly good lately. No major flare ups. I’m taking Levsin 2-3x per day every day which has helped. 

My question now is would xeljanz completely skew results of the calprotectin? I didn’t think to ask the GI. She only said to avoid NSAIDS which I do anyways.",2021-08-10 21:16:37

Since my entire life has been dealing with doctors, hospitals and quacks, I used to think the absolute rubbish treatment I was getting in the medical community was normal or just me. It blew my mind when I realised I'm not alone, that this happens to basically anyone with chronic illness to a degree and this made me really angry.

I am also a researcher working at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research looking into the genetic drivers of autoimmune disorders which puts me in a unique position of being both patient and researcher. And I get ranty about patient advocacy. Luckily, my boss is awesome and took my rants to heart. After heating some of the stories that have happened to me and fellow spoonies, she got angry too. So we set up this project on chronic illness diagnostic journeys in Australia, including self diagnosis and self medication.

For this project, 'autoimmune disease' is being used as a umbrella term because of changing definitions and the like. So we are including ME/CFS, MS, Parkinsons, anything with chronic presentation. If it's not on the list, please put it in the 'other' section. The survey should take roughly 20 to 30 minutes, is easier to do on a laptop than a phone (sorry, ethics had opinions about which platform we are allowed to use) and if you need to stop, you’re sent a code to resume where you left off.

The further we can get this distributed, the more solid the statistical trends we can infer - and numbers are a lot harder for medical professionals to ignore than anecdotes.We  need you, as **healthy controls** as well as **spoonies.** If we can spread this far and wide, we hope we can get a good enough response rate to build an online platform that patients and doctors can use to expedite the time it takes to diagnosis.  

We have ethics approval, emails to myself and my boss are on the project website below, data is de-classified and everything will be open access. Info on the project and who we are, ethics and links are on the website below. If you have a look and think this project has merit, please participate, send to family, friends, different community groups and if you have any suggestions on how we can get the word out or any other feedback, please let me know.

I am on the prep day for my colonoscopy which is the day after.

All that is too say - I'm not a very strong person. I've struggled with many health issues in the past, some chronic some temporary. In particular I deal with the constant struggle of mental disorders. The whole ordeal; anxiety, depression and worst of all suicidal thoughts.

I have scoured the internet for everything related to my symptoms and my stool test results. It just points me towards IBD. And I am so afraid. I don't want to live like this. I just want to be normal.

If anyone can offer some advice or solace to me, I'd greatly appreciate that. I don't have much to live for if I'm being honest and I don't know if I can handle the possibility of an UC or Chrohns diagnosis.

Does anyone have success stories with thioprines as they are my last option. 

Also any suggestions for what to look out for while on pred? Is a 30gm taper over 6 weeks a lot? Will it make me susceptible to infections especially covid or is it a small dose?

2084,My butthole is a trainwreck and I'm pissed off at my doctor.,vurpine,17,p3nlat,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/p3nlat/my_butthole_is_a_trainwreck_and_im_pissed_off_at/,6,"Y'all, I don't know whether to feel pissed off and bitter at my gastroenterologist (GI) or frustrated with my body or my apparent lack of self-advocacy or whatever the fuck but I am really upset about what's been going on. I finally got my GI to order an MRI for a problem I have been describing pretty perfectly since AT LEAST October 2020 and I feel like it should not have taken this long for a diagnosis. Also, surprise, >!I have a moderate rectocele with moderate rectal descent.!< 

For some background:
I'm a 37 year old uterus-and-vagina-haver and I've had a gastroenterologist for 19 years. During that time, I have been diagnosed with, in order: ulcerative colitis, anal tumor (benign; removed), tortuous colon, hemorrhoids, and hiatal hernia. I see my gastroenterologist regularly. I have also reported being sodomized (it was rape, but nothing against consensual butt sex). I am also an avid weightlifter, and I've been lifting weights consistently since age 16.

For the past 10+ months I have been reporting: rectal prolapse that is getting harder to reduce and the feeling that something is ""pushing"" it out, occasional fecal incontinence, rectal pain, and something ""herniating"" through my surgical scar. My GI has done 2 rectal (""digital"") exams and a sigmoidoscopy/endoscopy (""the spit roast"") and just sort of threw up his hands and basically said it's probably nothing.

I finally found a new PCP and reported the same symptoms to her and told her my medical history and she decided to order me a pelvic CT. As soon as she did that, my GI decided to cancel the CT and do an MRI defecography instead. 

So the MRI revealed a moderate rectocele with mild pelvic floor dysfunction and ~~a partial rectal prolapse~~ **edit: moderate rectal descent**. I got the MRI results on August 9th from my PCP, who told me to talk to my GI or a colorectal surgeon about it. My GI has been *radio silent* and I've sent 2 message to his office asking to talk to him about it. It's now August 13th and they still haven't shared my MRI results with me. The only explanation I can think of is that he is consulting with a team of specialists before responding. In the meantime I have been in some pretty significant physical discomfort as well as a lot of crying rage. 

From what I have read, conservative treatments such as pelvic floor physical therapy with biofeedback and management of constipation are recommended before surgery should be considered, as surgery can be complex and require a 3-7 day hospital stay with significant recovery period...and may only make the problem worse. FML.


TL;DR My uterus has collapsed onto my rectum, and/or my rectum into my vagina, and my terrorized anus is trying to escape the whole situation. And my GI won't talk to me.


Update: My GI is out of town this week, but he will be back in the office on Monday. I found a pelvic floor physical therapist in my city that specializes in rectocele and rectal prolapse and I've contacted them. I do not have a referral yet.",2021-08-13 17:44:34

I also have a lot of anxiety toward food, in my mind, being hungry -> and then not eating -> anxiety. When I don’t eat I get really weak and find myself losing vision/ being unable to think straight. I’ve tried to ignore feelings of hunger because I know I eat enough to be healthy but it’s still there and causing anxiety.

I seriously don’t know what to do. Also, whenever I eat ANYTHING I blow up like a balloon. I had a handful of Chex mix yesterday and if felt like immediately I was bloated.

2096,"Awaiting diagnosis while ongoing paid job search, can barely move/sit. What should I do?",Miscalaneousness,4,p4lpcq,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/p4lpcq/awaiting_diagnosis_while_ongoing_paid_job_search/,4,"I’m not sure who else to ask about this, or who else will understand the sort of situation I find myself in.

A while back, July 27, I was halfway through treating myself for a yeast infection. Well…

That yeast infection was not so. Or at least if it was, it was coupled with what is going on with my health right now. 

I find myself with ulcers on my actual bum hole. At least 2 currently. Though it looks like the last one that showed up (they didn’t come at the same time) is getting a little larger or worse. 

At first, they were thought fissures and tested for hsv at the walk in. This was aug 6. I was prescribed an anal suppository that I couldn’t imagine using that was supposed to help with pain.
Fast forward a week to Friday: in the middle of the night I’m in so much pain and crying that I call 811. When I tell the nurse my pain is 8 out of 10 she says to go to emergency. Emergency swabs me again for hsv and sends me home because the clinics results aren’t in the system yet. Saturday night I am crying so hard in pain I wake my mom, the pain gets so bad I almost passed out. The ambulance was called. I literally was lying naked in the bathtub screaming and holding ice cubes to my butthole while my mother held me. I don’t remember much of it. Paramedics came and I declined to go to the hospital because I didn’t feel they’d do anything.

My mother finally dragged me to a clinic and hovered through an appointment with me, which seemed to be the advocation I needed to be taken seriously, with now all my negative herpes tests in the system I was sent for ferritin, lipids, and b12 blood work along with a fecal cal protection test for Chron’s/ulcerative Colitis. I’m waiting for the results and should have them by Wednesday.

My dilemma is not just my personal health. At this time I am supposed to be ongoing supportive job search with WCB. I’ve cancelled the last 2 appointments because I am so lethargic I don’t know when I’ll be up, I’m malnourished because food is moving through me within 12 hours undigested, I cannot sit in an upright position for more than 10 minutes. I tried to see how far/how long I could walk tonight down the block… I’d say I made it 250 meters before it felt like razor blades and I had to turn around.

When I mentioned to My case worker that I was concerned about the effects of my health on reliability with potential employers, or even applying when I physically cannot perform anything… she said:

“well you could put your benefits on hold until you’re health recovers”

And there I am stuck. I have no clue what to do.
I have no idea how long this investigation into my health will take.
I have no idea how to supplement income after one has been on WCB for this long. If there are even programs for that.

I keep saying …
“I have 16 paid weeks, wait it out”

But then I also keep saying…
“It could take 8 of those weeks to see a specialist. What if you get more ulcers or get worse in that time? It’s only money. It will be there when you’re managing whatever is going on with you”

But then fear stops me dead in my tracks. It’s a different reason to be “off work” all together than a work injury and I don’t know when or how is the right time to make that call.

Can you help steer me in some direction here? Do you know anything about this diagnosis? Do you have any experience with a situation like this?

I have been given naproxen for pain. I am also keeping very clean and using a natural balm for pain/itching outside

My doctor thought that sounded like Crohn's and so I took a stool test that came back with elevated calprotectin, 130µg/g and lactoferron was 15.2µg/mL, but I also had a positive C Diff result, so my doctor prescribed antibiotics and within a week or so I felt way better ajd that was that. Until a month ago, when I started having some abdominal discomfort again (I initially thought it was bladder discomfort, but had no urinary symptoms.) I haven't had any stool symptoms either, but now my doctor is thinking it's Crohn's after all.

I'm going to see a specialist, but I sort of want to be mentally ready going in for what they're going to say - part of me is hoping the elevated levels were just from the bacteria, but part of me is very scared that it really is Crohn's

EDIT: As an update, I got a new calprotectin test and the result was 19µg/g. I haven't spoken with my specialist about this result yet but to me that's a good indicator that whatever I'm experiencing isn't crohn's or colitis.",2021-08-16 22:19:18

IBS with really odd symptoms?,brittanyd687,4,p70b7j,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/p70b7j/ibd_without_losing_weight_ibs_with_really_odd/,5,"I just want to start by saying that I am seeing my general practitioner doctor regularly and am on a waiting list with 3 Gastroenterologists for a colonoscopy... but for now I just am wanting to know what you think regarding if this is IBD vs a really weird case of IBS? I just want opinions while I am enduring a long wait. :)

History: I am a relatively health 30 year old female. Up until January 2019 the only health problem I ever had was being anemic. In Jan 2019 I started having some light blood in my stool I would say around 3 times a month, sometimes a bit more. As it was bright red and no pain and not too much blood really, I (stupidly) wrote it off as internal hemorrhoids thanks to Dr. Google and the fact that I was living in a very small northern Canadian town with crappy healthcare (so I didn't pursue further)

Fast forward over a year to August 2020 and this is still going on. However, one day randomly I wake up in SUCH stomach pain. It was like bad period cramps x3. I also felt like I had to empty my bowel constantly (like every 30 mins) but nothing would come out. Even when I would eventually pass a BM it would still not feel ""empty"". It was NOT like have to go urgently though like I have heard about IBS. It just was a constant feeling of having to go. After 2 days I could not take the pain after 2 days of this so I went to the ER. They gave me Dicetel (pinaverium bromide) to help with the pain and that did seem to work but also referred me to the city for more tests. Ever since this day FOR A WHOLE YEAR NOW my stool as been pencil thin. I do not regularly have anything crazy like diarrhea or anything else but it is ALWAYS pencil thin, not once has it been normal since that day in August 2020.

Because of where I live in Canada (I now have moved to a city, but it is a smaller one) the wait list for the Gastroenterologists is about 18 months. I was referred to one in Aug 2020 and my doctor referred me to a second one in June 2021. I have heard back from the 2nd one oddly did stool samples just the other week, while waiting to move forward. Recently, even taking the Dicetel is not working as good as it used to a year ago and I have a lot of stomach pain.

My C Reactive protein was High at 40.6mg/L in my blood test and my Calproctin level was 945 which was also very high apparently in my stool test. 

My doctor (who again is not a specialist) is convinced that I have IBD but everywhere I read says the main symptoms are weight loss, which I do not have. I am an average weighing 150 lb female at 5'5 and have noticed no weight change. Is this possible with IBD? Anyone else have a similar story?",2021-08-18 23:09:08

Examples: 

Okay, my stool has turned completely liquid now, but that means there are no visibly undigested bits of food in there, that's kind of a positive development, right? 

When I'm at home I pretty much run to the toilet every hour/half hour or so, but when I'm out and about it kind of stops, that's actually quite nice of my body, right? 

I have not yet found any kind of food that makes my sympymptoms noticably worse, that's good, right? I mean, it would be useful to know what to avoid, to get some kind of control back, but at least this way I can tell myself eating whatever I want is healthy for me because I need to gain weight, right?

I seem to have two different kinds of urges, those that will go away for an hour or even a few if I surpress them for a bit and those that will result in an accident within moments. I'm USUALLY quite good at knowing the difference/being fast enough in the 2nd case. Yay, right?",2021-08-18 22:47:19

There’s a clinical trial going on rn I guess ?

I probably don’t have a full understanding of this but the conclusion looks good enough for someone With ibd to at least try right ?

So I got diagnosed with IBD in December 2020, but I experienced symptoms from May 2020 (just took them really long to get me appointments/colonscopy/results etc etc).

Since then I've been on mesazaline 3g and it helps me not get pain or blood from some foods. However, I can't eat gluten or dairy, have them rarely, as well as some other things I can't have (spice, citrus fruits, I tend to avoid nuts too). I only began to have these intolerances when I first got IBD symptoms. 

It's been almost a year and when I was off the mesazaline for only 3 days, my symptoms came back immediately for nearly anything I ate. Despite it being a year, even when I'm on medication, there's still so much I cannot eat. If I do I get terrible pains and it's the worst especially if I'm at an outing.

I was just wondering if it gets better from here. I was diagnosed with ""mild"" colitis so they won't give me anything stronger than 3g mesazaline and I don't know how this works but it's been really tough. I don't want to live the rest of my life this way. It's so hard, only being able to eat (some) fruits, veg and very lightly seasoned meat. The doctors can't do anything else because the medicine is generally working. I'm going to try to talk to them again but appointments aren't frequent and it feels like I'm the only one trying. Has anyone experienced this or some similar situation?",2021-08-20 02:13:00
2130,Colonoscopy and Biopsy Results: Nonspecific Inflammation of the Colon + h-pylori.,m7e3d1,5,p7qbvy,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/p7qbvy/colonoscopy_and_biopsy_results_nonspecific/,2,"Hey all,

As a follow up to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/o3azlo/undiagnosed_after_urgent_care_pressure_left_side/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), my doctor recently conducted a colonoscopy and endoscopy.

TLDR of my previous post: Since May of this year I have had the following symptoms, with the symptoms peaking in June and now are relatively minor: increase in bowel movements to ~6 a day (now down to 2 or 3), narrowing of my stool (less pronounce now), pressure/heavy sensation near the descending colon (still there), dull pain in the descending colon region (mostly gone), nausea (now less frequent), and generally just an upset and sensitive digestive system (improved now). No blood in stool or abnormal blood/urine test results. Oh, and terrible heartburn, but has gotten better. 31 year old male.

Endoscopy results: *""Patchy erythema and congestion of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the stomach body and antrum. Findings compatible with gastritis. Cold forceps biopsies performed. Patchy congestion and erythema of the mucosa was noted in the duodenal bulb. Biopsy performed.""*

Colonoscopy results: *""Normal mucosa was noted in the whole colon, cecum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. No AVMs, diverticula, polyps, masses, evidence of colitis or other abnormalities seen. Cold forceps biopsies were performed. Small internal hemorrhoids were noted in retro flex.""*

Today I received a message from my doctor, requesting a follow up appointment to go over the overall exam and also the results of the biopsy, which noted *""Positive for h pylori bacteria and nonspecific inflammation of the colon.""*

I'm a bit concerned, and also confused with the biopsy results which show nonspecific inflammation. Has anyone here been diagnosed with IBD based on such findings? I had felt a big relief after the colonoscopy, since my doctor stated nothing significant or serious was seen during the colonoscopy. I know I'll find out shortly in the follow up appointment, but just wanted to hear of anyone's experience with such findings.",2021-08-20 01:31:24

2140,"Feeling anxious about being dramatic about my symptoms, have first colonoscopy Tuesday, putting my story out.",Sylilthia,4,p93yip,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/p93yip/feeling_anxious_about_being_dramatic_about_my/,15,"Hello everyone! I am finally getting a colonoscopy a decade after I was first told I need one. Access issues. I've gone through some intense agony in the past and I'm concerned that nothing will be found, that I'm going to keep fumbling in the dark with ""just IBS"". It's a hell of a case of IBS if so. I don't want to have UC or Crones or whatever else because having IBS is objectively better than an IBD (increased cancer risk, toxic megacolon which sounds like a fucking band name, ostemy bags, like fuck) but at the same time it feels like this is far more, getting worse, and the way I'm controlling my symptoms now is not sustainable.  

I have a tendency to minimize and deny my own reality and in 2019 I had a doctor at my free clinic all but call me a hypochondriac, which has stuck with me and makes me feel like I am just being dramatic. This is the top issue amongst a litany of other doctors basically telling me to just go seek therapy, like I hadn't been in it for years. I'm especially angry because my current doctor got funding for this procedure in a snap. I asked her how hard it was and she said easy.  I asked why didn't anyone justify this before, she gave me kind of a sad look and just said she didn't know. I'm going to be furious if I end up with something that isn't ""just IBS"" and if these funds have been out there this entire decade but no one thought I was worth justifying it. At best maybe they didn't know but, geeze, shouldn't a doctor know about these kinds of resources?

So because I've been feeling so much over my medical journey and feel like I minimize so much, I wrote up my entire history as clearly as I can remember it and I'm putting this out there because… I don't know. I need to let it out I guess. Bless anyone who takes a few minutes to read it.  

I am saving it to give to professionals when asked so that I don't have to keep telling this story over and over because it's filled with traumatic memories. 

Any comments are welcome, questions are as well because it will quite possibly lead to more details that I will keep logged. 

=======================

Mom reports as an infant I would have trouble moving stool. I would push a lot, but nothing would pass. They would have to rub my stomach in circular motions to provide relief. 

I lived with heavy smokers until I moved to college in 2007. Almost my entire family smoked; visiting relatives usually didn't provide reprieve. I didn’t have a door to my room until I was 12, then I could shut out a lot of the second hand smoke. 

Experienced first flare up at about 13 after eating ice cream, sleeping, then waking up in the middle of the night in agony. It was in my lower left abdomen, next to my hip bone -- a dull, but intense, ache. My lower back hurt as well. These pains are always present during these intense flare ups. I would only find relief after passing a massive amount of diarrhea, and it was difficult to pass it. I would have to push HARD and it would take hours of pain before my body would release any kind of stool.

Stools were usually 3-4 days apart during normal times, and I would usually pass large volumes of solid all at once.  No constipation issues until I was well into adulthood. 

Flares started to happen off and on, almost always at night. At 16, I felt feverish and fainted during a flare. I haven't fainted since, but I still get intensely lightheaded and feverish. There was no blood at this time, except on toilet paper which I don't stress about. 

At 18 I had a rare day spell during school and was sent to ER by nurse. Nothing came of it. Lost weight (200 or 210? to 180) because I became afraid to eat for a short period of time. I regained weight eventually after a couple of years. 

I moved to college and it started to happen far more frequently -- intense, dull pain, lower back felt locked up and so tight it hurts. 

Eventually I started to throw up so badly during these spells I would reach what I guess is bile. It was a bitter yellow substance. I started to camp in bathrooms as I wouldn't have enough energy to get out of bed repeatedly, several, several times. When the flare passed, I usually regained energy. The Mizzou doctor gave me IBS as an exploratory diagnosis and said I need a colonoscopy. This was 2010. I didn't have insurance and even if I did I couldn't afford copays. As of this write-up, I have yet to have one done. 

Time went on, spells became frequent and intense. Constipation started to be a plug sometimes. Rubbing my back where it hurt seemed to at least help a bit. I ended up in the ER several times because the spells terrified those around me. Eventually I just refused services when they were called. I lost a job because I was so fatigued after spells and missed too many days. I never finished college despite getting 90% of my degree done, and these flare ups are part of why I had so much trouble. 

Around 25yo, 2013, I met my partner, Rebecca and she witnessed them. They terrified her and kinda traumatized her because, well, it’s understandable when your partner is screaming in agony for hours and hours, up and down off the toilet, pale and intensely fatigued. We tried an enema once, and it made my world absolute hell for a period of time because more liquid was shot up and didn't get things moving. 

In 2017 I started to have occasional minor amounts of blood in stools during flare ups. Nothing major, I have no idea if it's just really pissed off hemorrhoids. The blood wasn't just on toilet paper, but in the toilet with the stool. I went to the ER the first time and the doctor, once again, suggested IBS and told me that it was being triggered by stress. 

I started to have mucus come out with stool, maybe even before this. I forget when mucus started but it was here by this time. I called them ass sneezes to find some kind of humor in the misery. Sometimes I would have to use the bathroom and would only pass a bit of mucus. I started to have issues with food not leaving my stomach and seeming to spoil in the top of my GI. I tried a low fodmap diet, but wasn't able to maintain it because food prep options were limited at the time and that resulted in a lot of not palatable meals. I forget how effective it was in addressing flare ups. 

As years rolled on Rebecca started to give me back rubs and both of us would use clockwise stomach rubs. It at least helped relieve pain and sometimes would get things moving. Eventually, after a few years, flare ups started to include hives and extreme sensitivity to things like even essential oils in my soap. 

During a particularly bad flare, Rebecca had me smoke tobacco. Very quickly I was able to move a large volume of diarrhea, the hives went away, and the spell was cut short by HOURS AND HOURS. This level of effectiveness only lasted for a few flare ups. It stopped being an insta-cure but WOULD still relieve pain and make it easier on me. 

Around 2018, I occasionally started to feel SHARP pains when things moved through the spot next to my left hip. The same exact spot it hurts during a full flare. It's like a knife is moving through. Usually it means I'll move something soon, but not always. Especially recently.  The sharp pain is brief and temporary. It doesn't happen all the time but I feel like it happens around when things are starting to flare.  

The hives started to get REALLY bad during flare ups. Large portions of my body turned beet red, itching intensely. Claritin helps, immensely. I have had occasional small hives on my lip and face since I was a child but this was, just, beyond anything I've ever experienced. It seems to happen towards the end of the spells when I am about to start moving things. OR it can signal a start to an episode, the back of my head gets hive-y and I now take Claritin when that happens. Usually some level of flare up follows. 

Hives happen even if I don't use nicotine during a flare up. 

2017-2018 involves us living in an intense flea infestation and I was bitten head to toe. I don't know if this is connected but only after we got rid of them did I start to have these bad hive reactions to this degree, I THINK. My memory is hazy here and it could be totally unrelated but the intense hives certainly weren't happening like this before. It could be entirely a coincidence but I figured since hives are immune responses I'd mention the fleas and how bit up I was, which the immune system doesn't like. I don't know if living through that could have left an ""immune memory"" of some kind. 

In 2019 I noticed my finger joints hurt during the spells. I tried the elimination diet and found my skin the clearest it's ever been -- I frequently have some kind of red splotches. My joints stopped creaking and clicking. I Identified some trigger foods (like onions, spiced meats like pepperoni). 

Rebecca delved into medical literature with the guess it might maybe be ulcerative colitis and developed a gut regimen from over the counter meds to see if we can minimize the flare ups. Multivitamin, turmeric, a probiotic. There was significant success, but not perfect. Food doesn't spoil in my stomach anymore, ever. Flare ups became more infrequent and shorter in duration. They stopped having mucus. I haven't seen blood in the toilet in years. I don't vomit until yellow stuff comes up. Hives still happen, randomly and whole body towards the end of a flare. 

In 2021 I have become kinda afraid of eating again. Since June I've lost 30lbs and I'm still dropping because I typically eat so little. I bought my own nicotine vape and my flares have been rare and VERY MILD. I use it quite a bit and it keeps the clenched lower back relaxed. 

The little eating likely helps to not create too much volume. Constipation isn't as much a concern anymore. I'm having trouble moving soft stool and small movements feel like I passed immense amounts. They are about the diameter of a quarter lately and even with a stool softener they can be hard to pass. 

=======================

That's it. Again, bless you if you made it through all this. Thank you for your time. I so appreciate it!",2021-08-22 04:01:10

My name is Tiffany, I'm a member of the team at a small autoimmune care startup called WellTheory. Many of us on the team have an autoimmune disease and are working toward building a long-term, autoimmune care experience.

We're currently surveying people with autoimmune conditions to learn more about how this new care experience might sound to people in their individual autoimmune journeys. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes. During the survey, you'll be able to: click through a prototype of our website where we explain the care experience and all its components, answer questions about your general impressions, points of confusion, what might be missing, etc.

Every day, I've been so inspired by the resilience and true determination behind the scenes in making this autoimmune care experience a reality (for people who have already gone through so much to find this type of care themselves). If you can spare even these 15 minutes, it would mean so much to us for you to include your voice and help us shape the future of autoimmune care! Thank you so much!

I have not been diagnosed with any stomach condition, however, my doctor is trying to figure out what it could be. She doesn't know if its an IBD, IBS, or something else. At first I believed I had IBS but I'm noticing some symptoms that aren't common with it.

I am 14 years old, and have had issues with my stomach for 2½-3 years now, however, its gotten so much worse in the past year. I have constant, horrible pain just above my bellybutton, and anytime I eat anything I have pain. Of course, there are certain foods that hurt more than others, generally meat is the safest food group for me, but regardless I still have pain. 

One abnormal thing is that when I wake up, my stomach hurts especially. I don't know why it happens. 

These issues have caused me to eat less, and have resulted in me losing 15 pounds. 

I have had an abdominal ultrasound, came back normal, and a blood test come back normal. My doctor is making me do another blood test, and she has now referred me to a pediatric gastroenterologist. 

If anyone could provide either tips for pain or ideas on what condition I could have, let me know. I appreciate any tips. :)",2021-08-25 06:51:12

It’s unlike anything I’ve felt before, and I’ve had stomach issues my whole life. It doesn’t feel like reflux, more like an intense scratchy burny crampy sharp feeling in my stomach, sometimes with vomiting too. I take Pepcid or zofran but they don’t always touch the pain. I contemplate the ER every time bc I’m shaking and dripping sweat, the pain is scary intense. I’m diagnosed with IBS-D and GERD, and have recently done a colonoscopy and endoscopy where they found a whole lotta nothing. I used to suffer from daily milder nausea, cramping, diarrhea, vomiting, but that seems to have been replaced with feeling mostly normal until these episodes hit. They only last a few minutes to a few hours, but I literally feel like I’m fighting for my life and have to give myself pep talks. Is this really just IBS? Any other testing I should ask for? When I had the colonoscopy I wasn’t having symptoms, does that matter? I have a close family history of Crohn’s disease. I also have a high positive ANA that is still a mystery.",2021-08-25 05:32:27

I was 6'2 175 pounds and started exercising daily and eating healthier which did make my stools look brown and healthy again but I still lost 50 pounds and now I'm 120-125 pounds. One day in the gym I couldn't lift any weight and was severely tired before I even started and got really weak and started having black tarry stool again. I did a carnivore diet to control my symptoms and my GI doctor diagnosed me with IBS and wasn't worried about my weight loss or stool color. Then I went to get SIBO breath tested which came back very high and I was given Xifaxan which didn't fully resolve my symptoms. I've had boughts of black tarry stools that usually occur when i've been eating carbs for too long and can last weeks to a month or stop taking supplements like berberine. I'm also usually constipated but I have had some diarrhea mixed in. Bloated constantly and have severe anxiety and food intolerances. I have only had red blood one time which was definitely from inside my colon because it was a lot. Colonoscopy didn't show anything and endoscopy showed erosions or something. I also feel weak and dizzy a lot of the time and can barely function. I literally cannot walk around consistently and feel disabled and like I would be fired from a job if i got one because I am so weak all the time. Calprotectin has come back high in the past as well. I'm going to get another endoscopy and maybe a small bowel study done to check for crohns and i'm eating mostly meat and small amount of vegetables just to barely control my symptoms.I only went to the ER once and my symptoms were severe bloating and what I thought was kidney pain but I think it was my intestines.

I’m 22/F. At the moment I am undiagnosed, but after over 18 months of chronic diarrhoea I finally went to the doctors and got blood tests and a stool sample (I’m aware of how bad that is, I should have gone much sooner). I assumed I had IBS but as symptoms persisted I wondered if it could be coeliac. Surprisingly to me, my blood tests came back fine, but it was my stool sample that was the issue. My GP said my sample was very inflamed and that I am being referred for a colonoscopy to check for IBD- something about being put on an urgent list, but it could take 3 months due to COVID backup (something along those lines, I’m paraphrasing because it was such a shock, but basically it sounded bad.) 

I had never even considered IBD because I’ve never gotten really sick, not lost weight, never had blood in my stool. Only diarrhoea, a sensitive stomach, loss of control and lots of tiredness/ lack of concentration. I know I won’t find out till after my colonoscopy but I can’t stop thinking about it, feeling guilty for not getting things sorted sooner, and possibly in denial because my symptoms aren’t reflective of what I thought IBD was.

Had some weird symptoms for 3 months like reduced flatulence, change in stool consistency, mucus, inflammed hemorrhoids. No blood in stool, normal Crp, high calprotectin and positive coproculture test for salmonella. 

Was reffered to an infectious disease specialist who concluded that those are weird symptoms for a salm infection, most likely it is some form of IBD, but to take antibiotics for 10 days , test again and then return to gastroenterologist for further evaluation. So the problem is that from the info I found salmonella is almost never treated and if it is the chances or a relapse or longterm shedding is high. That means no colonoscopy for me for god knows how long, and having an active inflammation without treatment.

I got diagnosed with a mild version of Crohns disease and my doctors wanted to put me on biologics immediately, but I'm in my early 20s and 50-60+ years of taking medication with a giant laundry list of side effects compounded over such a long time-span does not seem like a good combination.

I've read a few very high quality studies from Japan on EEN and PEN in Adults, and plenty of them about the use of EEN/PEN in children and the results of total EEN are statistically comparable to steroids (with added benefit of mucosal healing) and most currently used IBD medication. The problem being that compliance rates of EEN in adults are very low and the fact that as soon as EEN is discontinued the disease activity returns very shortly.

Now here's the deal - I'd much rather eat nothing but EEN formulas for the rest of my life than go on medication and risk the side effect profile over 50-60 years

**Sadly personal experiences with EEN and PEN are very difficult to find so If anyone has any experience with it, positive or negative, please be so kind as to share it here.**

___________

Edit1:
For the people who're bound to say ""Diet can't fix IBD, go on meds"":

-> I respect your decision on taking medication; but EEN is literally the only diet model with no side effects (sans bloating and diarrhea in 30% of cases) Thats been proven to be about as effective as IBD medication in achieving and maintaining Remission. 

Poor compliance rates with the diet in adults (less than 40% compliance in 3-6 months) are the reason it's not used as a main therapy - while being used to great success (up to 80%+ remission rates) in children. 
My mental fortitude is strong enough to completely give up food in exchange for not risking medication side effect profiles compounded over 50-60 years. 


Edit 2 - ""Mild Crohns disease""

->My inflammatory markers are below clinically detectable levels normally and below clinically detectable levels even during bouts of severe GI problems that are probably flares (diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating). 
My biopsy samples showed low-grade chronic inflammation in the last part of my small intestines and inflamed lymph nodes in the small intestinal area.

My brother had UC from the time he was in middle school till he died of bile duct cancer at 29. The UC undoubtedly contributed to his development of bile duct cancer. 

Now here I am, at the ripe old age of 25, having symptoms of IBD. I’m just trying to see a gastro but I’m waiting for them to call and make an appointment (I got a referral two days ago). My symptoms are getting worse. 

My parents claim my brothers IBD meds, particularly Humira and other biologics, causes the bile duct cancer my brother got. This leaves me three options - all likely resulting in cancer:

A: I don’t take meds, my IBD spirals out of control, I get cancer.
B: I do take meds, due to my unique genetic disposition, they give me cancer. 
C: I can’t get my small intestine removed because I might need it if I get bile duct cancer (bile duct cancer surgery involves removing the bile duct and using the small intestine in its place). Therefore my IBD in my small intestine can’t be operated on and I develop cancer in it. 

So to me, getting IBD truly does seem like a death sentence. I have no viable cure for it. Facing down my mortality at 25 is incredibly harrowing. I’ve never been more scared or anxious in my whole life. All my life plans are ruined. 

Sorry if this is doom and gloom or overly dramatic but it’s just how I’m feeling right now. Any advice or wise words would be greatly appreciated - even a “hey! Shut the hell up. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” would be appreciated.

2201,Low ish biopsy inflammation…. Can you have mild colitis?,Signal-Jellyfish6870,7,pgod18,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/pgod18/low_ish_biopsy_inflammation_can_you_have_mild/,10,"Hello, I’ve posted this on a couple of subs.

So I’m a little confused. I had a mega bout of bloody poop a few months ago. I was hospitalised for 5 days, by the time I got there it was pure mucus and blood, so they couldn’t even do a stool sample.
My bloods showed inflammation and they did a sigmoid scope and found some inflammation too. She took biopsies and said I had colitis. I didn’t have any infections or anything. I also had a CT scan. I stopped bleeding and haven’t had any bleeding since at all. I am currently on oral mesalazine.

The unusual thing is that I don’t have persistent diarrhoea. I have episodes about twice a week where I get pain, urgency and I pass huge amounts of slightly loose stool (4-6 times a day). The rest of the days are fine, although some mild pain. No blood.
My CT came back clear and now I’ve been told via a letter “biopsy inflammation levels are below that which we would expect for colitis, but it is still possible”. I have another autoimmune condition which he also mentions as there is often a connection apparently.

I was just wondering if you can have “mild” colitis, with mild symptoms?? Im worried I’ll be fobbed off at my next appointment because I don’t have typical or extreme symptoms. They are affecting my day to day life however. 
Any experience would be most appreciated. Thanks",2021-09-02 21:01:55

I assume the small bowel must be attempting to compensate in the large bowel’s absence, but I can’t find the info on how or why, and wondered if anyone could share more knowledge on it, or the mechanism? Or is it that the exit hole is smaller so it’s harder to advance that stuff through?

If I have bowel movements at afternoon, the stool is normal. I’ve been tired and performed poorly when running, that used to be easy for me. At this time I didn’t have bothersome stomach pains aside from quite frequent heartburn. The tiredness worsened and I sometimes started to feel lighthearted, which made me suspect iron deficiency. I had my hemoglobin and ferritin tested. Hemoglobin was fine, but ferritin was only 15. I started eating iron supplements.

Three weeks ago I started to have stomach pains (mainly at right lower stomach and upper left) and slight fevers. I felt like something was wrong and went to a doctor. He suspected IBD or celiac. I had lab tests done in which calprotecting was elevated (425). I also had positive result from tTG (17). My kalium level was also below normal. Here in Finland tTG level would have to be much higher in order to be able to diagnose celiac without biopsy. 

Since the calprotectin indicates IBD, I’m having colonoscopy done at 15.9. As far as I know, colonoscopy isn’t useful at diagnosing celiac disease? This makes me think that the doctor suspects that IBD is more likely in my case. 

Have any of you diagnosed with IBD had elevated celiac antibodies?",2021-09-04 15:54:39

I am in touch with quite a lot of people with UC which are doing great despite their condition. All of them are in remission, some of them for decades. Most of them are not even treated with biologics or immunosupression. One of them is treated permanently with topical mesalame (or cortison?), one is treated with oral mesalamine. One friend is not even treated permanently, he is only flaring every 2 or 3 years, one circle of prednisone and hes back in remission for couple of years. Only one friend has a refractory case and is in a flare for over a year and starting azathioprine for this right now. But even she is able to work ( actually she works a lot!) and is able to enjoy her life. One friend is in on humira for 10 years and said that he even forgot that he has UC because he never had any problems since that time.

I dont know people with Crohns though.

I just got diagnosed with crohns and asking if i can compare the situation of the people I know with UC with mine? I know that this is not a representive way of getting information and I know that anecdotal evidence is no evidence.

And i know that every IBD case is different.

But im asking myself if i would know more people with crohns, would it be a similar pattern? Are there more mild cases for people with UC than for people with crohns? Is UC generally more easy to get under control than it is for crohns? I guess that the really bad crohns cases are worse than really bad UC cases because it can affect more party of your body.

2240,Are these IBD symptoms?,dvorsakova,1,pjdp01,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/pjdp01/are_these_ibd_symptoms/,4,"Long story short: I have ankylosing spondilitis (since 2017, diagnosed late 2019) and it's apparently common that autoimmune disorders come in pairs. My doctor is suspecting IBD.

I had typical ankylosing spondilitis symptoms until late 2020. Since then, things started to get a little odd in my bowels as well. I have experienced a bunch of stuff, such as:

\- feeling sleepy to the point that my eyes get heavy and want to close AS I EAT. Not half an hour later, not even 5 minutes later, but *at the exact time* *I'm chewing*. When this happens I always get a weird sensation in my intestines.

\- having to poop immediately after eating

\- extremely dry eyes as I eat, also accompanied by weird sensation in my intestines - does not get better with drops, goes away randomly all of a sudden

\- eyes closing and extreme sleepiness as I put on makeup on my eyelids

\- breathlessness (sometimes extreme) after eating

\- breathlessness after pooping

\- nausea after pooping

\- if I feel tired my poop has a brown-yellowish color

\- feeling exhausted the day after I eat spicy food

\- poop in all possible consistencies throughout the week

\- poop with mucus

\- eyes with mucus in the morning accompanied by tiredness

&#x200B;

If these symptoms accumulate, I'm likely to poop twice or three times a day. If I'm having a chill day I'll probably just poop once.

&#x200B;

I see you people complain about pain -  I don't really have pain. As for bloody stool, I only had two episodes: one in 2018 (diagnosed as an internal hemorrhoid) and a pretty weird one in June 2020, when I was feeling weird all morning, then I had bloody stool (bright red) and needed to immediately lay down cause I got ridiculously exhausted and ended up falling asleep. My doctor at the time dismissed anything serious based on the color of the blood. Since then, no more blood.

&#x200B;

My ankylosing spondilitis treatment applies to IBD as well as any autoimmune disorder (Coimbra Protocol), and it's been working wonders for me, so I'm not very concerned that things will get worse, but I'm sure there are adjustments to be made in my diet - if I even got IBD, that is.

&#x200B;

Does anything of what I said sound familiar to you guys? Hmmmm!

I'm male in my mid 40s.  I could be wrong, but I'm guessing that it's a complication from contracting Epstein Barr virus back in early 2019, diagnosed when I went to the emergency room with a swollen throat.  I was very sick with that off and on for a couple months. Eventually those symptoms subsided and 2-3 months later I started having chronic diarrhea, watery stool with cramps/aches.  I knew right away that something was wrong because I immediately tried getting on a simple diet (which in the past would cure things in a day or two) and still had diarrhea that wasn't going away.  Little did I know how bad it would get!

Over the next few months I started waking up in the middle of the night with cramps and would end up spending 1-3 hours in the bathroom crapping my guts out every night.  And if I managed to avoid waking up, it would just happen to me in the morning, sometimes during the day.  Finally I decided to see a GI, and got a colonoscopy.  They biopsied parts of the colon and the test results came back ""colonic mucosa with mild chronic nonspecific colitis."" He put me on mesalamine and hyosciamine (as needed), neither of which seem to do anything.

I'm now trying a higher dose of mesalamine (2.4g/day, delayed release 400mg capsules) and it still doesn't seem to change anything.  I've been on this for a little over a month and I'm about to give up on it.  I don't know what to do next.  I totally understand there are people here who have much worse problems and I am in awe of what you have to go through, and I should be thankful that I haven't had surgery or bloody stool yet, but still this has really diminished my quality of life.  Every night when I go to bed  I expect to wake up at some point with cramps and spend a couple hours in the bathroom, waiting for when I feel like I can go back to sleep.  And very often I go back to bed and wind up back in the bathroom 20 minutes later.

I've tried hyosciamine sublingually but it doesn't seem to have any effect.  I've also tried Imodium and Pepto, but by the time those take effect, usually the whole thing is over.  For a little while I was drinking Imodium every night before bed.  It worked alright for a few days but then it seemed to stop working.  I guess I should try budesonide but I'm scared of the side effects, so I'm still praying that this goes away on its own, although after almost 2 years I'm losing hope.

I've gone back to eating whatever I want because it doesn't seem to matter that much.  I'm going to bed at a reasonable hour and then because of this 1-3 hour interruption, I'm sleeping in every day and people think I'm oversleeping!  I have to tell them that even though it seems like I got 10 hours, I actually only got 7.

Anyways that's my story right now.  This GI guy seems to have no answers for me.  I'm considering seeing another GI doctor, but I'm not sure if that will make any difference.  And maybe there is some other underlying cause of this that I don't know about, like bile acid malabsorption or something.  I keep wondering if maybe the mild chronic nonspecific colitis was something I always had but was nonsymptomatic and that this was actually a sign of another problem, but I kinda doubt that's the case.  From what I've read, my symptoms seem to be textbook microscopic colitis.  Guess I'll just keep hoping.  Anyone have any advice?

My question is, do you ever get used to intense pain? I have pretty high pain tolerance and most of the time I can deal with all the pain and discomfort. Sometimes, like last night the pain gets really intense and the meds don’t seem to help it enough. At some point the pain gets so bad that some “lizard” part of my brain starts to think that I’m dying or that my insides are going to burst. It gets quite impossible to reason and keep calm. Lucky the pain does ease eventually, but the experience is absolutely horrible and makes me fear the next time it gets bad.

I have had UC for 16+ years and have really struggled, particularly in the past few years. Whenever I have gone on Prednisone in the past, my doctors have put me on 40mg. It helped, but didn't put me into remission, ever. I had dropped to 77lbs. a few years ago and the norm for me was seeing blood and 15+ trips to the bathroom a day. I tried Budesonide, Mesalamine, Remicade, and Entivyo and they didn't work. When I first went on Entivyo, I was on 40mg of Pred for 6 months and still struggling.

A month ago, I got a colo and the doctor said I was so bad I should be hospitalized! She put me on 60mg of Prednisone because that is what they would give me via IV if I were admitted. It has been a month and I feel 95% better and am 8 lbs. away from my goal weight! Yay for me, yes, but my frustration is that no doctor had but me on a high course of steroids before this and I have had this disease for 16 years!!! I am just a bit surprised because there was no end in sight for years and now in a month I am almost in remission.  On paper, I have had some of the ""best"" doctors--leaders in the field. I KNOW THIS DISEASE IS DIFFERENT FIR EVERYONE, but does anyone else feel like there is a lack of a standard of care for treating this condition?

One more thing, I bought an infared sauna and started using it everyday when I started the 60mg. I have had absolutely no side effects from the steroids.

I've actually been getting worse over the past year as no other meds are working for me so I'm fighting between this horrible hunger and also everything I eat hurts. 
I just wish I didn't feel so hungry all the time, I eat as much protein as I can and I'm terrified of fibre but I eat mushy vegetables and soups so I can try and get the nutrients in. But I don't want to keep gaining weight because weight loss hasn't been a major problem for me and every time I've been on pred I've gained a bunch of weight. 
I also would love to exercise but I'm super fatigued and scared to leave my house in case of an accident, especially as I know any physical activity can trigger a bad flare for the rest of the day, on top of my long term flare.

On July 12 2021 I was hospitalized with severe anemia and later to find Severe Ulcerative colitis. Before the hospital I suffered with symptoms for the entire month of June. I was afraid to go to the hospital bc I didn't want to find out the worst.But coming to find out waiting so long made things much worse. I weighed 135 before everything happened. I was had 21 bowel movements of blood the day before my ER trip.As i was in the hospital for 21 days, I had 2 blood transfusions as well as constant iv liquids. In the time span of 2 months I lost 40 pounds. The severity of my condition had 3 roads I could take... 1. Remove my entire colon...2. Emergency start of Remicade(Infliximab) in the hospital...3. Lose my life.

Luckily insurance was able cover the Remicade so they got me on it right away. My CRP( the protein used to measure inflammation) before remicade was in the high 130's. The normal level of CRP is below 10. The day after my first Remicade infusion it dropped to 80 and every day after it dropped by 15-20 points. I had 1 blood transfusion the day before I got discharged from the hospital. I weighed 94 pounds....

3 days before leaving the hospital they put a PIC line in me(A iv line that ran in below armpit through a major artery all the way above my heart. I had a TPN bag hooked up to the PIC line 24/7 to give me the nutrients I needed because I couldn't eat solid foods. I had the PIC line and nutrient bag hooked up continuously for a month.

After gaining 10 pounds while on it I made enough progress to have it taken out in the last week of August.

Since then I am still on an Elemental Diet( Liguids only) made of supplement plant based protein powder and have gained 20 pounds since getting discharged from the hospital on July 30th 2021.
 
My journey is only beginning and I've been in ups and downs throughout my IBD start. I came here to find people going through what I am and to hear all the different experiences I can.

My friend has crohn's disease. I wanted to help him to track his bowel movements and learn insights about them, and as a big fan of spreadsheets – I developed a tracker using Google Forms + Google Sheets.

I made this and a couple of other templates for certain conditions at work with him, my team at work, and a GI specialist. It helped him to take action and be mindful of what he eats (and drinks!) so I thought it might be helpful to share here for others with IBD!

How It Works:

1. **Make a copy of the GI Tracker Template.**  Get the tracker [here](https://www.wingspanhealth.com/blog/gi-tracker-google-sheets?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=gitracker).
2. **Make entries about your bowel movements through Google Forms.** Fill out that newly created Google Form (Titled: Copy of GI Tracker Template) wherever you saved the copy in your Google Drive every time you want to make an entry about your bowel movements.
3. **Discover insights about your bowel movements through data points and graphs in Google Sheets.** Check out the Dashboard tab in the Google Sheet for data points and graphs about your bowel movements. You can play around with the filters such as dates, symptoms, and the impact on your day to gather insights about your bowel movements through the dropdowns in the tan-colored cells. Then scroll right on the Dashboard sheet to see dynamic graphs and data lists.
4. **Review notes based on filtered criteria in Google Sheets.** Hop over to the Notes sheet after setting the filters in the Dashboard tab where you can review your notes based on those criteria.

Please check it out and let me know what you think! I'd love some feedback to make it more useful and better.

I’m 24 and AFAB, white half-Jewish American, no other physical health conditions.

Main symptoms are little to no appetite, feeling full/sick after eating only a little, nausea, constipation and some diarrhea, abdominal pain - both general and sometimes specifically lower right quadrant, and undereating as a result of the appetite loss/nausea. It’s been this bad for over 5 months (started to ramp up a bit before that though), and is hugely affecting my QoL, preventing me from working full time (even remote), particularly I think undereating is causing fatigue. I’ve visibly lost weight.

I’ve had a CT and ultrasound to rule out appendicitis/ovarian cysts plus some blood work at the ER - all normal. colonoscopy and upper endoscopy with biopsies, they saw mild inflammation but all biopsies were normal. Did some stool tests, fecal calprotectin was a bit high, so they gave me a short course of budesonide (2wks at 9mg then 2wks taper) which helped a lot but only while I was on the highest dose. Did a small bowel barium X-ray, bacterial overgrowth breath test, gastric emptying study - all normal.

Currently on budesonide again but after 1.5 weeks it’s not helping except I have slightly more appetite. It feels like I keep getting hints that it could be crohn’s but no clear evidence and I think we’ve ruled out pretty much everything else. If anyone relates or has other insights I’d appreciate it.

I was diagnosed with relatively mild ulcerative proctitis in 2017. I've been on mesalamine on an as-needed basis, rarely any blood. My main GI symptoms are mucous, bloating, and alternating constipation and diarrhea, but honestly not too disruptive.  


What I've found to be the most disruptive actually are a constant stream of canker sores / apthous ulcers, which my gastroenterologist says is a common manifestation of IBD, but I haven't seen them discussed much here. They ebb and flow but typically appear for 10-14 days each time, and I occasionally have them in quick succession. These are really quite painful and make eating difficult and drinking difficult, to the point that it's almost a nutrition issue. I've tried to isolate some environmental causes such as toothpaste that contains sodium laureth sulfate but they still persist so I'm certain this is an autoimmune/IBD mediated issue.   


My gastroenterologist has prescribed a mild steroid paste that ""caps"" over the sore called Kenalog in Orabase, and greatly reduces the pain, but I have them so commonly that I don't want to overuse the steroid. My understanding is that oral ulcers seem to be more common in Chron's rather than Ulcerative Colitis - do you think having them this often makes it more likely that my IBD might also have a Chron's element?

Went to the hospital for possible fistula, GI requested for a colonoscopy, found out my ileum's inflamed (possibly Crohn's) and confirmed I have complex fistula (3 tracts: 2 tracts meet, the other 1 has an abscess inside). GI suggested I get surgery first before we start medication/treatment on the IBD. Got a pelvic MRI, and then went to two separate doctors for opinion.

CRS: Suggested to do start medication first on my IBD as fistulectomies heal extra slow with its presence. Besides, he said fistula may heal and close with medication. (Is this true?) His reasoning was as long as the IBD's not managed, recovery will be very slow. Obviously, this goes against what the GI suggested.

General surgeon (but has lots of experience in rectal surgery): Wants to proceed with surgery, applying seton suture on the 3rd tract. Opened the possibility of giving me a colostomy bag to prevent feces from passing through my rectum, thus aiding in the recovery of my fistula.

So I need help deciding which course to take. If you had an experience close to my condition, or any experience with anal fistula and IBD, I'd love to hear what you can say about it. Thanks!

Fast forward to now, same problem.
I stayed underweight for nearly ten years after the first flare up.
I’m anemic, I stay tired and dizzy. No matter what I eat right now, within ten minutes it goes straight through me. I have what feels like intense hunger pains even when I’ve eaten and I’m not hungry.
I haven’t gotten a diagnosis yet, but I don’t know how it could be anything else. They agree that it is more than likely Crohns. 

Anyway, how the heck can I gain/maintain weight. I’m not super underweight, just by 5 pounds right now but my body just isn’t absorbing anything. Life is really stressful right now, and I just got on antidepressants/anxiety meds this past week to try and just make it through this whole ordeal.

I've been pretty unwell this past week, more than usual. For context: I'm currently in a colitis flare and I am on pred taper whilst waiting for my humira to come through. I usually go to the toilet like 4-6 times a day and it's all types on the Bristol stool chart. Last Tuesday I started to get horrible diarrhea and cramps which has been coming and going in waves but then I spent the entire weekend on the toilet and its only just started to ease a little again today, I'm in so much pain and so gassy, my stomach is really bloated and it just feels heavy I also can't press on it without being in a lot of pain. 
I've contacted my IBD team and they're super good and they ordered stool samples to check for c diff and all sorts as well as my calprotectin (it was 1800+ about a month ago before pred).
I'm doing my best trying to help myself feel better by trying to keep up my protein and fluids eating and drinking small amounts regularly and staying away from trigger foods but I'm just stressing myself out not knowing why its come on so suddenly. 
I've never had c diff before but I've recently come off 4 rounds of continuous antibiotics and I know that can cause it but also I dont know if the diarrhea can be easier some days and then come back horrible the next like it has been with c diff.
It also just doesn't feel like how I've been flaring before so I'm not sure its that.

I've also not had any illness since being diagnosed with colitis so I don't know what affects me how so I'm just sat here feeling useless not being able to work because of how tired and in pain I am (when I'm not stuck in the bathroom). Has anyone else had something similar and what was it in the end and what helped make you feel better? I won't know the results from my sample until Thursday at the earliest, probably Friday.

So, here goes. about two and half years ago, I started getting really sick. Constant nausea, no vomiting, abdominal pain, acid reflux, very early satiety/fullness, even worse constipation than I had most of my life. In the first 3-6 months I lost a total of about 50 pounds, and I struggle to stay above 110. Symptoms always seem to get worse as the day goes on. About 3 months ago, I finally met a GI doc that gives a damn. 

Had me do a delayed emptying test, but results turned up non-diagnostic because I couldn't finish the meal they had given me. Then I recently started having diarrhea and blood in it out of nowhere. I did a stool test, and my Calprotectin levels were upwards of 2,200. So my GI ordered a Colonoscopy, Upper Endoscopy, and this week I just had an MRI of my Small Intestine. None of them showed any signs of inflammation. 

GI Doc says she's spoken to her colleagues and they're all as baffled as she is. I'm going to be having a wireless capsule endoscopy in the upcoming weeks. Does anyone have any idea what's going on, and what they're missing?",2021-09-22 18:02:50

2339,Interpreting results? Suggestions for my GP?,flups444,6,pt91ar,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/pt91ar/interpreting_results_suggestions_for_my_gp/,12,"I was wondering if someone can help me make sense of my results. My GP didn't really engage, and I don't think he really understands them - though he has referred me to a GI (now I'm on a waiting list for January!)

I went for a endoscopy (gastro + colon), and the results of the scope came back as: ""*Mild patch inflammatory changes in colon of uncertain significance. Very mild IBD? Recent infective process? Await histology*""Full description: ""*Area of mild mucosal granularity and erythema around appendiceal orifice. Multiple focal areas of mild erythema and granularity with punctate erosions and presumably haemosiderin deposits through the mid to proximal colon that appears to be centred around lymphoid follicles. Rectum and ileum normal*"" (Histology summarised this as ""*Mild inflammation around caecum + focal areas through colon*"")

Histology just came back as: ""*Features are that of non-specific active chronic proctocolitis. The differential diagnosis includes infection and IBD. Clinical and endoscopic correlation is recommended*""

The specifics sound more serious than the summary

* Caecal biopsy: Colonic mucosa with severe active chronic inflammation. Marked architectural distortion with cryptitis. No crypt abscess or granuloma formation. No dysplasia or viral cytopathic changes.
* Random colon:  Colonic mucosa with severe active chronic inflammation. Marked architectural distortion with cryptitis and crypt abscess formation. No Granulomas. No dysplasia or viral cytopathic changes

I looked up *non-specific chronic proctocolitis* and saw it's not the most informative term. But the findings seem consistent with some form IBD. Though given it sounds fairly IBD-like, is it normal that they weren't sure? And is it normal for the scope and histology to differ as such?

Also, perhaps of greater concern, if I have an active infection or an IBD flareup - is it right to not be trying anything to either further diagnose or treat the issue? Seems worrying to just wait to be seen by a GI in a few months. I think my GP would be happy to assist, but just doesn't know what to suggest.

Note I don't really have many IBD symptoms, e.g. in terms of diarrhoea etc. Scope was for possible GERD (though upper GI results fine), and an anal fissure which was managed by taking movicol (a stool softener) at a low dose for a while just to ensure no tearing. No diarrhoea even with that.. A few years back I had pain for some time in upper left abdomen (just below ribcage). That seems to have come back now post endoscopy, quite a bit worse than before, but seems to be subsiding. I was on doxycycline for a year which I've just stopped, but now read might be linked to CD ...

So a quick synopsis of what I've been dealing with and been through TL/DR at the bottom...In late July I started having uterine pain. I struggled in pain for weeks trying to get in with my OB and ended up going to the ER where they didn't see anything glaringly wrong. I asked an OB friend that I work with about it and they did an ultrasound that showed 3 large cysts on my right ovary and fluid accumulation behind my uterus. Fast forward a month later and I was still in pain and worried, I reached back out to my OB and could not get an appointment any sooner than 2 weeks. I went back to the ER, and again they sent me home with no reason for my pain. I reached back out to my coworker OB that found the cysts and she brought me in and wanted to do a Diagnostic Lap to see what was going on. I went in for the lap on 9/17. After the lap, I was told that I had ""a lot"" of adhesions and scar tissue all over my abdomen. (I've never had surgery before this lap.) They had to call a general surgeon in to find my appendix (wasn't in the right lower quad), and found it encased in adhesions/scar tissue in my right upper quadrant - they removed the appendix due to the weird location and it being wrapped in the adhesions. I was told I would be referred to a GI specialist and would need a colonoscopy since I had so much scar tissue and inflammation. My uterus was flipped over on itself cutting off blood supply and my friend OB fixed it. I'm now day 6 post lap and having terrible pain under my right rib. I know CO2 gas used during surgery can cause pain and I had that initially but at 6 days my neck and shoulder pain are gone. The pain under my ribs is constant and aches terribly. I've been constipated and am on day 11 of no bowel movement. I am moving gas (I have to force it - sorry TMI). I'm taking Miralax, stool softeners, gas x, and laxatives twice a day with no improvement. I tried an enema 2 nights ago and had one small marble-sized ball come out about 5 minutes after the laxative. Nothing since. My question is - could constipation cause the terrible pain under my ribs (right side)??

TL/DR- 11 days with no bowel movement. 6 days post lap with appendectomy. Adhesions/scar tissue/inflammation found all over bowels with no previous surgeries or c sections. Taking Miralax/stool softeners/gas x/laxatives twice a day with no bowel movement. Tried an enema two nights ago - only one marble-sized ball produced. I am able to pass gas with moderate exertion.

So I went back to my GI to ask for his opinion what step should I take for my complex anal fistula: should I take medication first or should I proceed with surgery?

I was surprised that the GI went with medicating first before surgery. After my colonoscopy, they recommended I should go for surgery first because I'll be on anti-inflammatory & immunosuppressant meds, and now they're backtracking on what they've said before. They then gave me a prescription for Mesalazine, even though in my MRI  an abscess was found and that I still leak pus from my fistula. It just doesn't make sense to me to be taking immunosuppressants when I still have signs of an active infection. Well they said it is still up to me what I should do (they probably felt I wasn't satisfied with his choices) but I left their clinic confused.

To add further confusion, the two surgeons I consulted with said what I have is Crohn's, the GI said they weren't sure what it is specifically, they're just certain it was an IBD.

I want to give them benefits of the doubt since in where I'm from, IBDs only became prevalent recently (around 2010s, as one of the doctors said). Maybe they haven't had enough experience with this disease. But... IDK.

So yeah. I just want to rant and air out my frustrations because I want to start with the correcting of my condition. I've been bouncing around doctors for months, going back-and-forth between saying I have to have surgery or medication. It has affected my life: I'm afraid of going out because of my symptoms; I had to turn down a job interview because I thought I'd be going into surgery soon. I don't even know at this point what I truly am facing, and the uncertainty's so frightening; and the added hassle of our third-world healthcare system + the adjustments with COVID has been extra tiring and frustrating.",2021-09-23 07:42:14

I was diagnosed with IBSD 10 years ago. About 2.5 years ago I developed chronic diarrhea that occurs 8-16x/day, all watery, all urgent. I went to a GI doctor 2 years ago and got another colonoscpy. He said I had collagenous colitis. He wrote me an RX for Xifaxin, dicyclomine, told me to take pepto and immodium and go on a low residue diet.

This did not work. After a few more months, I went back and he wrote me more Xifaxin with Mesalmine. He told me to continue the immodium, dicyclomine and pepto

FFW 2 years and I'm still suffering. I tried budesonide, xifaxin 4x in 2 years, meslamine 2x.

Currently, im on the max dose of pepto (8x/day), max of dicyclomine (160mg/day), immodium 2x/day, Viberzi 200mg/day and mesalmine. I currently have 12 or so soft stools with urgency per day.

My GI did some labs and I tested ""non equivocal"" for a biomarker of crohns. We have another appointment in late October (his first available). In the meanwhile he told me to take IB Guard and add simethicone to my daily meds.

I have developed pretty severe depression through this. I cannot sleep, I don't eat fruits or vegetables. I've lost a lot of weight. I asked about Humira or Remcaid and my GI doctor said that once you start those, you cant quit so he wants to treat me conservatively. I went for a second opinion and the 2nd doctor said the same thing.

I need advice prepping for a flex sigmoidoscopy Friday at 11am under propofol.

He told me I don’t need to do prep the night before. He sent me home with a document that said don’t eat or drink after midnight the night before UNLESS the procedure is at noon or later. If it’s at noon Friday or later I can drink water until 8am. 

So I called and asked if I could drink water at 6 am or 7 am. The doctors assistant told me no because I could aspirate and die….but how does that make sense if I could drink water until 8am with a noon procedure?

I ask this because I wake up at 5-530am (I have toddlers and work) and I can’t imagine having no water before 11am.

I feel mostly fine, just tired sometimes and I can't eat raw veggies, lactose, or sugary/oily foods like I used to. I've had proctitis for a year now, mesalamine worked for a bit but then failed miserably, and I just took prednisone. What did I get from it? Insomnia, anxiety, and minimal inflammation reduction. How can I feel fine, but have insanely high calprotectin results and fail steroids??? It feels like a fucking joke. There's something disturbing about knowing you're festering on the inside, but not even being able to feel it or do anything about it. 

I just got that last round of calprotectin results last night so I'm waiting to see what my doctor says about that, but I'm starting Humira soon either way. At this point I'm terrified Humira won't work, either. None of this feels real. I don't want to be that patient who's unresponsive to everything and needs their rectum or colon removed, especially when I can't even feel the damage. I mean, I'd much rather remove it than get cancer, but it's infuriating either way. Why me, you know? I always ate healthy, never had health issues, and then boom IBD. Fuck me.

31M, recently diagnosed with mild colitis and so far handle it good, but what concerns me is my mind.

My biggest concern is traveling. Traveling is the one think that fulfilled my life, I am traveling since 18, approximately 8 times per year, abroad, to rich countries, to poor countries, I ate good food, and bad food, but was always happy to try varieties.

Since I am diagnosed, I am afraid to travel anywhere. There are thousands of questions in my had, what If I get flare on airplane, what If I get it in Africa country with poor health system, what If I get it on business meeting. My colitis is mild so far thankfully, but I read that people get hospitalized, and what if happens abroad.

4 months of disease and so far it is under control, if it does not get worse I would be happy, but I don't know how to put mind in a control, forget about this for a moment, and be happy again. Is this really possible?",2022-01-02 09:50:41

I was diagnosed with IBS at 15, no tests were given to confirm this, I have been completely symptomless after cutting out lactose at 18. Consequently, I didn't believe I had IBS, just that I was lactose intolerant. 

GI symptoms started about 6 months ago. Pain, cramping, nausea. Pain is usually mild but constant most days but has sometimes been so bad I have been in tears. I also experience rectal pain every time I poop, although that also varies from mild to agonising. Nausea is pretty much constant also. I generally have diarrhoea, although sometimes find it hard to pass and usually need to visit the bathroom several times to feel fully empty. I do experience constipation, but less frequently. I experience sudden urgency and cramping regardless of the consistency and it's led to me feeling anxious and avoiding eating during busy days. I also went from having mild travel sickness to awful nausea, retching and diarrhoea if I'm even in a car for 5 minutes.  I have been unable to travel by car since and all attempts (despite prescription travel meds, IBS meds and anti nausea) have led to me having awful diarrhoea and vomiting, and having to be driven home instead of making it to my destination. I have tracked symptoms for 3 months and have found no link to diet, exercise or stress. I generally live a healthy, active lifestyle, I enjoy cooking, walking and I meditate daily. There have been no concurrent changes in my life, and if anything I'm less stressed than I have been in recent years.

I'm currently awaiting a gynaecology appointment for suspected endometriosis, after anaemia probably caused by heavy periods and awful period pains. I know endo can affect the bowel too, so I don't know if I should put these symptoms down to that. It's an 8 month wait to be seen at present so I'm worried about feeling this poorly all that time, especially if it isn't even caused by the endo.

I have psoriasis and eczema, which I experienced very rarely and mildly until recently, where it has become more of a problem and unresponsive to my usual treatments. I know endo, psoriasis and eczema have an inflammatory component which is what led me to look into IBD. I'm really lost at the moment, and I know nobody can tell me what's going on with my body, but I'd appreciate advice on wether IBD is something I ought to bring up to my GP. I did mention my bowel symptoms when asking for an endo referral but they were dismissed as IBS and not even noted on my medical record.",2022-01-04 18:06:18

I'm looking for some advice on what to do until I see my new GI. I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet.. My old GI was incredibly unhelpful. She didn't even want to do a colonoscopy even though I've been in severe pain for weeks and my stools all wonky. They finally did one. My colonoscopy report said: 

**Ileocecal valve, biopsy: 
- Focal chronic active colitis 
- Negative for granulomas 
- Negative for dysplasia 
- See comment
The differential diagnosis includes inflammatory bowel disease, infection, drug-related injury, diverticular disease-associated colitis, among others.**


My GI said ""it's too early to say it's IBD, let's check again in a few months"" meanwhile I've got pale clay color stools, haven't had a solid stool since before Thanksgiving, and still having lots of pain in my upper right quadrant just below the ribs, all of my symptoms preventing me from working because I am just in so much pain all the time. Said she doesn't think my issues are GI related. Offered no advice on what to do in the meantime. I kid you not, she gave me NOTHING to work with. Didn't offer any kind of dietary changes, medication changes, if I should see a different specialist. She told me to see my PCP because she can't help me at this point. 

I put myself on the low FODMAP diet and it helped. I stopped taking pantoprozole and my right side pain has finally started to go away. (My upper endoscopy revealed no damage in my esophagus and my stomach itself was medically boring. I felt safe to stop it. My GI insisted I just had acid reflux until I had the colonoscopy.)

31M, 4 months ago diagnosed with mild colitis, went into remission quickly.

4 months in remission, on 2g Mesalamine per day.

However, I noticed in the last couple of days that I am losing hair drastically. It does not fall out during the day, but in the evening when I wash my hair, later I can find 50-100 hairs in bathroom, which was not the case before.

I am sure it is not from flare, since my flare was mild, only 3 days, and my full blood test is perfect including thyroid, liver, vitamin d and biotin.

My conclusion is that it can be from mesalamine or anxiety since I worry too much about colitis.

Since I assume it does not make sense to interrupt mesalamine therapy that keep me in remission, my question is what is your experience from mesalamine and hair loss. Does body adapt to it eventually and reduce the hair drop, or I can expect it to become worse/bald completely during the time?",2022-01-05 18:53:42

I’ve had severe intestinal pain since early November with the new symptom of blood in my chronic diarrhea.

I’ve been on 3 rounds of antibiotics with no improvement and The ER doctors and my own GP suspect an IBD, yet despite all that and my CT scan as showing my stomach as unremarkable my GI thinks it’s stomach related.

I am male with diagnosed indeterminate colitis, had only mild symptoms before I was put in remission where I am currently for 6 months on Mesalamine.

My stool got back to normal, formed properly, 1 per day, no blood or mucus. However, I am still having days where I am having abdominal pain, cramps, and increased gas. I get only 1-2 diarrhea per month. My bad days can range 2-5, after I still have no any bad symptoms for 10 days, and then I suddenly develop cramps and pain again. 

I went to my GI to ask for rectoscopy to check for flare and he said that If I have less then 3 stools per day with no blood I cannot be in flare. He sent me to do blood CRP and Fecal Calprotectine and both came back very low in normal ranges. Based on results my GI did not wanted to do rectoscopy, instead he told me that I probably developed IBS since I am too worried about disease.

Is he having a right? Is it possible that I got IBS due to anxiety associated with IBD? Is it  true that pain and cramps only are not symptoms of flare?",2022-01-14 21:47:28

Had a checkup with my PCP who’s also a GI specialist (two for one is great). My symptoms are basically just diarrhea that I think is food related or IBS. I have an abdominal pain that’s very localized and seems to be muscular in origin, but to be on the safe I told him about both. 

He’s doing a blood test for celiac and gave me a breath test for sucrose intolerance. He says that if both of those come back clean, then the next step would be colonoscopy. However, he doesn’t seem that worried and thinks that it would most likely be microscopic colitis considering I have no blood or severe pain. 

Here’s my question. Is there a test I can take before doing a colonoscopy? Obviously I’m going to ask him about this as well, but wondering if anyone has had experience doing something like a stool test, etc, that could indicate whether or not a colonoscopy is needed? My insurance isn’t great and I would probs need to pay out of pocket, otherwise I’d probably just go for the scope.",2022-01-14 19:53:07

My pathology diagnosis is:

\- Non specific colitis in ampulla recti. No clear sign of IBD

\-Colone tissue with no inflammation, cekal region inflammation free, ileocecal valve inflammation free.

My GI says this is probably UC even there are no pathology signs yet (mild level). When I asked about the Chron since terminal ileum is affected, he said it is probably not Chron.

Can it still be UC even terminal ileum is inflamated? What do you think?

2471,Wife's symptoms during a UC flare,UCHusband101,2,s5g0cm,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/s5g0cm/wifes_symptoms_during_a_uc_flare/,16,"Apologies for the wall of text, I haven't talked to anyone about this, so this was rather cathartic for me even if I don't get any replies.

&#x200B;

My wife has had UC for 10 years, she had been in remission for the last 5 but is currently in the middle of what i would call a bad flare. She had a colonoscopy a week after the flare had just started and that seemed to make it go from mild to pretty bad. They noted the inflammation after the colonoscopy and prescribed her 40mg oral prednisone a few days later, by then the flare was at its worst. Her doctor also prescribed Inflectra.  She's currently on asacol and mesalamine enemas, and I think one other pill, this is the first bilogic she will have tried. It's been about a month at this point since the colonoscopy and maybe 3 weeks of prednisone, she tapered to 30mg.

We've been waiting for the Inflectra to get approved, that in itself has been a headache worthy of a different post (The doctors office acts like I'm out of line for calling and getting updates, despite being the one to figure out the pharmacy and insurance companies were on different pages and the whole thing was stuck in limbo). But in the meantime, her symptoms have changed. Her abdominal pain has mostly gone away, and number of BMs she thinks has dropped a couple. Overall quality of BMs has slightly improved, but there's still blood and still urgency and probably 8+ times a day. She's sleeping or trying to sleep around 14 hours a day.

But the worst part is the headaches and nausea. It seems like some BMs trigger nausea, and headaches are pretty severe and last quite awhile on more days than not. I'm also concerned about her heart rate, it seems like resting on the couch the rate is around 120BPM and walking up the stairs gets it to 150. She also has a dry cough occasionally. I've checked her temperature multiple times to make sure she doesn't have toxic megacolon or a perforated colon, those don't seem to be likely. She's eating a pretty limited diet of things she says have always been safe for her, no raw vegies of course. I've bought ginger tea, ginger root pills, peppermint tea, CBD pills. Some of them seem to work some, but it's hard to tell if it's placebo just due to time passing, or if they're really helping. She thinks the ginger root pills help so she takes one of those most mornings. She likes the smell of the peppermint tea when she's nauseas. We also bought a gel headband thing that you stick in the fridge for cooling your head when you have a headache, she likes that but is still pretty miserable. I think one of the worst things is the sense of general malaise and dread that she just constantly feels sick.

Her doctor told her to go to the ER if things got worse, but my wife replied with the state of COVID in our hospitals, she would have to be really bad off before going in. Her doctor didn't push against that, and it's hard to say she's gotten worse since the abdominal pain and BMs haven't gotten worse.

Pretty much all of her symptoms are ones I can find online of people suffering from UC, so I don't feel like there's anything new or noteworthy about her case. It sounds like people just suffer with these symptoms, and apart from waiting to find and receive a medicine that works for you, i'm not sure what can be done. I think the only thing the ER would be able to do is maybe IV prednisone and fluids, but she doesn't seem to be dehydrated, she drinks a ton of water and gatorade and pees regularly.

&#x200B;

I guess my question is twofold. Is there anything I should be watching her for beyond TMC? Something that should make me push her to contact her doctor again or go to the ER?

And two, what is the biological process that's causing her to feel nausea, headaches, heart rate, and tiredness? She's probably getting close to anemic, but her hemoglobin was still pretty good (she told me it was pretty good, i think it dropped from an all time high near 12 down to 11?) when she had it tested during the Inflectra approval process a couple weeks ago. I was raised in a religious home that didn't allow medicine, so I'm still pretty naïve when it comes to basic human biology, but I imagine her body is just putting everything it's got towards healing the ulcers.",2022-01-16 17:57:20

I'm 35(F) and have recently had the various tests that come with diagnosing IBD. 2 x calprotectin tests 2 weeks apart (1st over 800 2nd 40), stool tests for the usual e.coli etc are clear and blood tests are normal and no infection markers. My colonoscopy report says there is focal active chronic colotis in the sigmoid colon. It also states to treat as self limiting in the first instance and if that doesnt work then look to an IBD diagnosis with possible need for more biopsies. I'm not after a diagnosis here, I'll get that when i see my GI in feb, I'm just after a little more info to prepare myself. My questions are:
1. Are there any other causes of Self limiting colitis aside from medication (NSAIDS) and infection? I cant remember the last time I took ibuprofen and there are no bacteria in stool, nor any infection markers/symptoms (like fever)
2.. How long would someone expect to have self limiting colitis? My own symptoms have been for the last 8 months. Would you expect it to have cleared up by now? 
I'm not sure if this entirely the right place to ask this but I guessed you guys would know a bit about it. I just want to be fully informed for my appointment given that it's now 7 weeks post colonoscopy and another 2 to wait and I want to make the most of it.

This was my first really severe flare and I was naive enough to assume I’d leave the hospital fully healed. I am better than when I went in but I am still flaring. The doc said this is normal but it’s very new to me. He described me as a cruise liner that had been going in the wrong direction. Turning back around takes time. The IV steroids they gave me brought my CRP down and reduced me from 20+ movements to ~8-10 and we are upping my biologic. He said I can expect to take up to a month to get better but, if the steroid tablets keep my inflammatory markers down, I can recover at home. The main issue now is sleep. I get most of my movements in the night. In the day I can go several hours without needing a toilet. I can go for a walk in the park or go out to the shops. At night, I’m up every few hours and I really want to try and reduce this. Is there anything I can do/take/eat before bed to increase my chances of a good nights sleep?

The one thing I could always count on was my good health.  

Recently I've been undergoing a handful of tests due to some bowel pain that I've been experiencing. I have minimal symptoms other than a feeling of persistent pain/ discomfort/ cramps. I've had countless blood tests, a colonoscopy, and a CT Scan. Nothing seemed to be too alarming in any of those tests. Mild segmented colitis was seen in the colonoscopy and the CT scan was ""unremarkable""

I have also submitted two stool samples for testing. The calprotectin levels in the first test were 55 ug/g, and in another test 3 weeks later the level had elevated to 900 ug/g. 

Is such a large jump over such a short period of time common? What could cause something like this? The abdominal pain that I'm feeling seems to migrate around my lower abdomen and becomes more and less intense at random. 

If anyone here has any insight as to what may be going on, your thoughts would be appreciated. Is there any further testing that I should request that may help with a diagnosis? The GI specialist that I'm seeing has been underwhelming in terms of interest and attentiveness, so I'm doing the most I can to learn about what may be causing my issues without jumping to any premature conclusions.",2022-01-19 16:46:01

So I'm currently waiting for a colonoscopy to diagnose or rule out Crohns or Ulcerative Colitis.

I have has symptoms for years and years. Unnecessary bowel movements, cramps, bloating, general pain and unwellness. 

Recently, this has got worse! To the point where I have almost taken myself to A&E after being doubled over and crying in public whilst thinking my intestines are going to burst 😭

I was taking Laxido but it was too much for me so now on Fybogel. I also take codeine for general aches and pains and wonder if this is making things worse as I know it can bung you up. Although, I don't feel like that is what is happening. I've also had a blocked bowel which resulted in the Laxido etc. 

My most hated thing is that I don't feel like I absorb any nutrients from my food as it goes through my body too quickly. Any ideas or recommendations how to change that? I have dark circles under my eyes, struggle to lose weight and am generally EXHAUSTED all the time. I just want to be happy and healthy and this is not currently (hasn't been my whole adult life; 35 now.) 

I've tried IBS diets I.e. FODMAP and all fermentable sugars had to impact on me at all so it's not that.

The idea of IBD is new to me so if I could get ahead of the game, that would be great. Any advice, suggestions or help would be wonderful.

My first stool test showed inflammation, around 190. Referred for colonoscopy which showed my whole colon, bar the rectum, had light inflamed. They called it indeterminate colitis mayo score 0-1. Biopsies just showed the same, mild inflammation. A recent stool test was again 190. I also have GERD and gastritis if relevant.

I've been brainstorming what could be causing it. This all started when I had constipation for 4-5 days, like I said in May, and just couldn't poo despite feeling the urge to. I eventually did so a massive poo, which had loads of mucus which was unusual for me. I definitely didn't have any mucus in the month or two prior (I'm a hypochondriac, so I checked my poo in April 2021 at least). Since that constipation episode I've had these symptoms.

He put me on a heart monitor for two weeks, I’m getting an ECG next week, and said to hydrate really well in the meantime.

25 male. Roughly two years ago I started having recurring diarrhea. Typically once or twice a month I would have a total blowout which was always almost totally corrected the next movement. I would get terrible cramping and rushing water noises from my abdomen. However this pain went away the moment a movement was finished. My doctor did a sample for parasites etc, Clear. Doctor did ESR to check inflammatory markers which was clear. The only oddities were mildly low B12 indicating some level of malabsorption, and slightly low MPV which I’ve heard means not much but can be associated with IBD. Anyway as I’ve worked on my diet being better the episodes have gotten further between but still once a month or every other month I get the runs. With very bad cramping. I am more gassy on average as well in general and I often get cramps even with normal movements. Doc said without any ESR levels being raised or weight loss it’s unlikely any IBD and to be fair a friend I have with Crohns does second that in his experience. Plus he said my pain going away the moment a movement is done isn’t par for the course with Crohns, is that true? 

In the end the doc said it’s likely IBS, it started after moving and major life changes so the stress part fits. It’s intermittent but still fairly far apart and the pain is gone with a movement.

I’m moving to South Korea in two weeks, and I need to bring 6 months’ supplies of cooled injections with me, on a trip that’s about 25 hours from my home to my new apartment. After spending months searching for a delivery company that can do international shipments of injections that need cooling, I came across these special coolers that keeps temps of 2°-8° (35f-45f) for up to 50 hours, which completely solved my problems and eased my worries. But looking through the communities many people are searching for a solution for the same problem and are unaware of these coolers. They have models starting at about $39.99 USD I think which is not expensive at all considering the hassle it saves.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I don’t work for this company, I just messaged them with a lot of questions I had about the product and they were EXTREMELY helpful and responsive For the first time after years of struggling with my autoimmune disease, and difficulties with medicine and insurance, I felt SEEN. I told them I wish I was aware of it sooner, and they asked me if I would like to help make people aware of their coolers. I personally bought 3 (and paid full price) and measured their accuracy, I managed to get the needed temperature 36 hours after putting the medicine in, without any electricity connection. I really believe this is a lifesaver and if you go to [4ALLFAMILY website](https://4allfamily.com?aff=22) and use the code SAFE10 you can get them at a discount. Feel free to ask anything and I’ll try to help :)

I will try to make this as short and organized as possible. I am 21, symptoms started in July 8  2021after I had a big bowl and caused bright red bleeding ( that same day a close relative died from cancer), the next day I woke up with a sore left abdomen which just got worse, I developed Diarrhea, constipation and loose stools, I went to the ER and demanded to get a CT scan because the first time I went they just said I had IBS, The CT scan with dye showed everything looked normal. For the next 2-3 months I still had loose stools and left abdominal pain (same spot everyday) I never saw blood In my stool or after wiping. But ever since I was a kid my body tends to chaife and needing me to go wipe an hour or two after cleaning but now when I would chaif after a workout I would wipe and have some bright red dry blood along with dry stool residue. After the third month the left abdominal pain subsided and I still get it sometimes but not often and the loose stools stopped for the most part and I still get some constipation but my stools have never gone back to the size they once were from when I had blood back in July. Fast forward to today I went for a walk where I felt burning in my anus from residue from the last time I went to the bathroom and again I had bright red blood with some residue of the stool but I never had or saw blood in either the stool or the wipe. The bleeding only tends to happen when I do exercise or walk and didnt wipe properly the stool before (which have never had blood in the actual stool or paper after)  and its always just one wipe, by the second wipe I no longer see blood. Other note: normal bloodwork, no loss of weight. Regardless I already made an appointment for a colonoscopy but I am just very concerned and wondered if anyone might make sense of the bleeding which makes no sense to me. Has someone have a similar experience?",2022-01-28 05:41:52

I posted a while ago because my gastroenterologist suspected Crohn's based on my symptoms. Basically bloody stool, a lot of mucus, stomach cramps, chronic diarrhea, canker sores, joint pain, and the strong urge to go without being able to. Also the fact that periodically I have a night where I spend it throwing up and having diarrhea in a lot of pain. They ordered an endoscopy and colonoscopy. Colonoscopy was clear, but my endoscopy showed a stricture in my esophagus and gastritis. As far as I know they're still suspecting Crohn's based on my symptoms.

I haven't had a night of intense pain since this time in 2020. Until last night anyway. It felt like knives or razors were moving through my digestive tract. It hurt so bad I couldn't walk comfortably. Today, after managing to fall asleep the cramps are still there and the stomach pain is still there, just a lot less severe. I'm still having watery diarrhea too. I figured even if this isn't IBD (I honestly don't know if it is) I'd ask you all how you deal with this. If there's anyone who has tips of dealing with pain like this it'd probably be the people on this sub. It hurt worse than I remember the previous ""episodes"". I should've gone to a doctor then honestly, and I still might if the diarrhea doesn't go away soon.

One of the things that I've had difficulties with lately (I'm hoping that this has more to do with fatigue and brain fog than age) is waking up in the morning not remembering the precise number from the night before.  It can be anywhere from two to five - but with so many awakenings I'm usually a wreck in the morning; and this has been going on so long that it seems like one miserable night is like any other, so I'm not always clear on the details.

As I pass by my washer-dryer on the way to the bathroom, I've started leaving a bag of wool dryer balls on top of the dryer every night - and I remove one from the bag every time I need to ""mark"" the occasion, so to speak.

The irony for me is that this not only helps mitigate the effects of my enfeebled brain in that I have an accurate count in the morning - but these lovely little discrete, formed dryer balls also remind me what I'm ""aspiring"" to (I'm lucky if I score better than 7 on the stool scale).

my symptoms: i am unable to eat much of anything. ive been avoiding eating, even, because i feel so sick afterwards. occasionally i can eat a meal (i had a sandwhich today finally around 4 pm) but then pretty soon after i eat *anything* I get very bloated, and it feels like i urgently need to have a bowel movement but when i go to the bathroom, nothing happens. I also start getting sharp pains--mostly in the left side of my abdomen--which gradually get worse. usually but not always, i get nauseas at some point an hour or so after eating as well, which is either very slight or very extreme. and thats all if im able to eat solid food, sometimes i can't eat solid food at all because of intense nausea and pain. sometimes the symptoms fade during the night but more often if i eat something the day before, the symptoms carry into the next day and I can barely function. i rarely vomit, i never have, the nausea and pain just feel so debilitating. and not eating has really been affecting me because i have no energy and im exhausted all the time and it's hard to concentrate. and even at night i have trouble sleeping because im either waking up drenched in sweat multiple times or my whole body just hurts, which doesnt help. in addition my p00p is all kinds of screwed up. it started out as diarrhea and then switched to intense constipation and then switched to diarrhea again but it was mostly just like i felt like i was going to have diarrhea but when i tried it was clear, mucousy, and gross. and then it went back to constipation with lots of mucous and now im not sure what it is. there is even occasionally blood in it, mostly when i wipe, but the last time i had a bowel movement it was the most ive been able to go in months and it was very dark (almost black?) and the best word i can think of is ""tarry"" which i know can have to do with blood as well. i had a stool sample container and so that is in the lab right now. 
ive been missing work and i really cant afford to because if i cant pay rent i have no where to go, so ive been really trying to advocate for myself but im not very good at that and im not sure what to do. does this sound familiar to anyone? or does anyone have suggestions on what to do? i have had an upper endoscopy, an ultrasound of my stomach, a gastric emptying test, and a hida scan, all of which were normal. i asked about a bowel disease and my gi doc said that i could do the stool sample but he didnt think i could tolerate the prep for a colonoscopy which i do agree with, but im discouraged and i dont feel good and all of that is making me anxious, which of course makes it all worse.

I have bright red blood mixed in with my stool and sometimes I get it by itself with nothing but mucus. I also sometimes get mucus in my stool, but other times I have it by itself with either blood or nothing else. I also have had black stools. There’s been times where I’ve been going to the bathroom every hour and I’m almost in tears because it hurts so bad. I’m not sure if this is relevant, but I’ve been pretty tired at times, my body hurts, I don’t sleep too well, I’m prone to migraines, and I have two autoimmune diseases. 

I went into the ER for abdominal pain in late September. They ruled out any reproductive issues, appendicitis, STDs, and a UTI. They diagnosed me with “belly pain.” I had a CT scan a few days later and it came back normal. Finally a nurse at my primary care office referred me to a GI. I went in for my first appointment two and a half weeks ago and they ordered nine stool samples and blood work. I went in today for my follow up appointment and they said that everything was normal. No parasites, no celiac disease, no thyroid issues, no anemia, no inflammatory markers, and no blood in the stool samples that I gave them. I'm going to have a colonoscopy and an endoscopy hopefully within two weeks. Has anyone had normal blood work and stool samples and still been diagnosed with an IBD?

But the last 2 weeks he was pooping water — so this was a huge issue. He was lethargic. Had a bout of vomiting. A fever.. but the diarrhea with water persisted. 

We had labs done. His Sed level was high (14) it says anyone his age should be under 10, c reactive protein was higher limits (.62 mg/dl). And he was positive for lactoferrin. 
Higher range neturophils (48%)
Lower range lymphocytes (42%)
Has a low RBC — anemia etc. 

They tested for every bacteria, parasite, and food-related illness — all came back negative. 

His ped is not acting concerned about IBD and keeps thinking he had some sort of infection or virus. He hasn’t been exposed to anything and I’ve expressed how no one in the family was sick — but him.

Trigger warning ⚠️ *sensitive content concerning IBS and bowel movements*

I’m pretty terrified that I might have IBD. It’s been known I have IBS (both kinds), and lately in the last month I’ve had chronic diarrhea. I’ve had at least one movement each day that’s incredibly loose. I also have canker sores which I’ve never gotten before. I know those two things make it sound likely that I have it, but I’m not sure. The doctor is running stool samples now and I’m just so afraid. I’m 26, and for the last three weeks it’s been non stop diarrhea. The doctor prescribed Bentyl for the diarrhea but I’m afraid of the blurred vision side effect. I have a ton of medical anxiety and I get really freaked out when anything messes with my eyes. 

I’ve had IBS flare ups (at least that’s what I thought it was) but never for this long or this bad. 

*further warning* ⚠️ *even more discussion about symptoms*

No weight loss at least not a lot of weight. I’m 200 lbs and have been that way or just around that weight for a while. I still have a decent appetite but not a ton. And there’s no blood in my stool. 

Anyways. I just need some insight here. My mother’s brother has Chron’s but there’s so much online that’s confusing about whether or not it’s genetic. I know it’s a rare disease but I’m genuinely afraid here. 

I’ve also been on a “bland” diet for about a week and no change in symptoms. Canker sores seem to be healing just fine and have only been here for a week.

I was diagnosed with Crohn’s about 3 years ago, but have been suffering with it for about 7. It took a while for me to be diagnosed because I present pretty atypically. My main issue is constipation and I never had a high CRP and had only noticed blood in my stool a few times, which was blamed on hemorrhoids. 

Anyway, I feel like my flares are a bit weird. Often, before I feel any GI symptoms, I start to get super tired and achey all over and get headaches. And since I started my treatment (4 Apriso per day), I won’t really get blood or diarrhea during these flares. Honestly, my main complaint isn’t even the GI stuff (I’ll usually feel somewhat constipated and bloated during this time). The issue is, I can’t really get my GI to help me during these times. He checked my fecal calprotectin and CRP the last time this happened, and when they were both low he just blamed it on something viral. The thing is, this is exactly how I felt before I was ever diagnosed, and I never had a high CRP then (though FC was never checked). 

So, I just want to know if anyone can relate to my pattern of symptoms? I know that I don’t have super severe crohns but the quality of life concerns are becoming super real. 


N.B. I had my vit D and B12 checked about 6 months ago and have been on supplements since. Haven’t gotten these re-checked but I don’t think it’s the issue.",2022-02-12 00:14:15

-rectal spasms (rare - maybe once a month or so - they last 5-10 minutes after having a bowel movement - they are painful and typically have me crouching on the floor hugging a towel until they pass - for some reason this seems to help them pass)

Recently, I’ve been having lower abdomen burning. Mostly on my right side, but it radiates all over. It feels inflamed and having gas can be painful. 

Is the lower abdominal burning something you guys have experienced? It gets pretty intense and has been very bothersome for the past 1-2 weeks. I know I need to speak to a professional and I will, but I was just curious.

2617,Life after IBD diagnosis,AdSpecific2929,4,sqiaz4,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/sqiaz4/life_after_ibd_diagnosis/,16,"Hi, so this is actually my first time writing on here. Sorry if I make mistakes since english is not my first language and I am in a state of absolute panic.


I'm a med student who's been dealing with on/off digestive problems for maybe 3 years. My symptoms have always been pretty mild until december where I started pooping blood out of the blue. Of course being the hypochondriac med student that I am I realised that this could IBD so I went to the doctor to get some blood tests. The doctor called back and told me everything was normal and I can confirm she was right because I saw the results myself today. Everyting is normal... EXCEPT that god damn CRP which is elevated at 9.7.  Even if it is not THAT elevated, it stills makes me freak out about the possibility of it being because of IBD.

I know that panicking wont solve anything and I can't do anything besides waiting for my colonoscopy results that I (test that I will have to pass on valentines day, how nice) but I am trying to accept the fact that IBD is probably what it's gonna be. 

I always wanted to help and cure people, now the idea of being sick myself makes me extremely anxious, so I really would like to hear about some of you and how your life has been since your diagnosis.
I think this could help me to accep this diagnosis.

Thanks!

Edi: My biopsy results showed activated lymphoid follicles without any sign of activity so it doesnt really fit with IBD. The part that the doctor thought was irritation in my colonoscopy was probably some activated peyer patches. However my biopsy samples contained very few glands and a lot of lymphoid tissue so it's not completely clear. Since I dont have a family doctor / GP I'll never get investigated any further. So that's about it.",2022-02-12 04:58:56

I am 24 F, who has been struggling since OCT 2020 with GI symptoms. Referred to GI for blood in stool, abdominal pain, the works. I got a colonoscopy in June of 2021, where inflammation in my terminal ileum was found, but the biopsies were negative. They told me to go on a FODMAP diet, to which it did not work. I got checked for Celiac's, and everything. Everything was unremarkable with the exception of my CT scans and recent MRE. I have been following up with my GI, but she has not gotten back to me about my current results on my MRE. I will put the results down below. 

Impression: 
1. Mural thickening and gadolinium hyperenhancement in region of distal ileum
with right lower quadrant lymph node enlargement, suspicious for inflammatory
bowel disease to include Crohn disease. Recommend colonoscopy for further
evaluation, as clinically warranted.
2. 1.8 cm gadolinium enhancing soft tissue mass within right supragluteal fat.
Recommend sonography for further evaluation.

Is it possible for the Crohn's to have been too early in the disease to come up positive on the biopsies? I am just at a loss and seriously hoping that I can get some closure on whether its Crohn's or not. My GI system is hating me and if treatment can help me get some sort of normalcy, that would be nice!

For my first post, I’m gonna ask if UC can cause some symptoms that go beyond the what most people know to be IBS symptoms, frequent use of the RR, blood, cramping and pain in the guys, difficulty maintaining weight, etc. 

I ask because I have a few other things going on that I just wonder if they’re caused by my UC, my diagnosed depression, both, or maybe something else. 

In the last 2-3 years, I’ve been almost constantly tired or just had low energy in general. I feel like I need a nap almost every day, but I usually get at least 6-8 hours of sleep nightly, and I’m only in my late 20s, so I find this to be odd. I do think that this has something to do with the depression, initially I thought that was the sole reason, but then I got to thinking - maybe it’s also a symptom of UC because my body isn’t getting the nutrients it needs from food due to my UC in comparison to someone who has a healthy gut who does get the nutrients they need. I also regularly wake up feeling queezy or with an upset stomach and I can’t eat breakfast until I’m up for 30 mins to an hour. If I do eat, my stomach gets really upset and I have admittedly thrown up in the past, before I recognized it to be a normal thing for me. I also regularly have heartburn and its at the point in the last year or two that I’m regularly taking Prilosec. I try to get some breaks in there, because I know you’re not supposed to take them for more than I think a week or two straight, but if I’m not taking them it can get extremely annoying. Not unbearable, but definitely more than just an annoyance. 

These are the three big ones I’ve noticed, but I also feel like I get frequent headaches, my joints have started to occasionally ache, and there’s a few other things. Maybe it’s just me getting older and nearing my 30s lol. But does any one else experience things like this, or are there a lot more “other” symptoms of IBS conditions that go beyond the standard symptoms most people know about?",2022-02-14 06:34:44

I have now been referred for an endoscopy and colonoscopy being carried out this Thursday but won't get the results or consultation with the gastroenterology department till the 19th march!

Frequent urination as well.  In the last six weeks I’ve also lost ~20lbs (146-124lbs), the last two weeks I’ve also been weak and fatigued, almost blacked out a couple times from standing or when I was stretching to reach something, also worsening abdominal pain. The last two days I’ve had black stool, had an exam today and no blood. My appetite was a little better a few weeks ago but now I’m back to eating almost nothing everyday. Good days I have a protein shake (plant based nondairy) and or chicken noodle soup. Maybe some peanuts for a snack. I know I need more fruits and veggies, I’m trying to combine the protein powder into smoothies. 
No one really has an idea, the most common is ulcers or ibd or ibs. I quit my job to focus on school more this past summer. I planned on getting a job a few weeks into fall semester but got sick. I have no money, massive medical bills and no answers. I’ve been given so many different meds to try and the only things that’s helped and only reason I get to my exams and some lectures is marijuana, only time I eat too. But the pain goes away by late afternoon or early evening? It always has since the start. 
Because of the dark stool and worsening pain and I haven’t been able to see a primary care provider for 4ish weeks, so fatigue is new since last seen. I went to urgent care who sent me to the ER. My labs came back perfect yet again. That’s all anyone ever does. I had a rectal exam today and that’s more than anyone else has done. Ibd has been mentioned almost every time I’ve seen someone along with ibs, and ulcers. No one has tested or talked to me about how to manage it I have any of those or even in the mean time while I wait until June to see a gastroenterologist.

I have what is potentially a really silly question, but I figured the people here would be best suited to know! I have my first colonoscopy on Thursday (diagnostic—some doctors, and I, suspect IBD while others insist it’s IBS. Place your bets!), and although I don’t begin the formal MoviPrep process until tomorrow evening, I’ve been on what is effectively a liquid and soft food diet for several days already because my body is refusing to digest stuff (even my pills aren’t breaking down properly anymore). I’ve been really ill for months this go-around, but over the past couple of weeks especially I’ve had a lot of mucus/pus, and for the past few days I’ve been passing a lot of solid intestinal lining as well; I’ll spare you the photos, but one was a chonky boi of about 8 inches that literally looked and felt like someone had put a section of colon in a dehydrator. 

My question is, if my body has shed all this already, is there a risk that all the nastiness will be cleaned out by Thursday and I risk having my colonoscopy look falsely ‘clear’ in terms of acute inflammation? On a related note, if the exacerbation of symptoms over the past couple of weeks stems from something like an infection, would that mask any chronic issues on the scope? The surgeon will be taking biopsies which I know can give more info than visuals alone, but after seeing accounts on here of people who had delayed diagnoses because of ambiguous inflammation in their colonoscopies, I wasn’t sure exactly how much my doctor *would* be able to tell.

Apologies if this is really weird or obvious—I’ve tried doing my own research and come up with nothing.

Thank you!",2022-02-22 22:59:22

* In December 2021, I went to another restaurant and ordered a big plate of pasta. My wife and I also finished 2 bottles of wine. (very rare! We were on vacation). The next day I went to the washroom and this time I was 100% sure there was blood in my stool. The blood was coated (not mixed in).
* The next couple of weeks there was intermittent bright red blood in my stool(very very little) and that is when I decided to go get a colonoscopy and gastroscopy. The results came back normal. Biopsies also showed normal.
* My doctor said there is a ""tender"" area in stomach lining and prescribed me Omeprazole. He told me the bleeding was from 1st degree hemorrhoids and my stomach issues were from IBS. I have since then been on a diet (not 100% strict)
* For the past two days. I have had shooting/sharp pain in my abdomen. Nothing painful but just discomforting. I also noticed that my back/kidney area was not feeling regular.
* Today I went to the washroom and there was blood mixed in my stool (a darker kind of red). I don't want to be graphic but the best way I can describe the blood is like ""raisins inside of stool"". There were numerous ""raisins"".

I don't understand what is going on. I am reading online that blood in stool is not a symptom of IBS but my doctor is telling me 100% it is not IBD.

Diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (specifically proctitis) back in 2020, but confirmed it was in remission a couple months ago via colonoscopy + stool samples.

For the past few days now I've been dealing with a mixture of constipation and diarrhea. It feels like I've drank colonoscopy prep and simultaneously angered some ancient IBD god right now-- every 20-30ish mins I get the urge, bad cramping, and then proceed to only have a tiny bit of diarrhea that leaves me feeling like I barely got anything out, and now my asshole feels like the 9th circle of hell. I haven't been eating any different, haven't taken any other meds. Haven't been particularly sick recently, except for the fact that this seems to get significantly worse recently when I had some strange allergy/sinus flare-up (which I still don't even have answers to what that is tbh). The diarrhea comes with a lot of pelvic pressure/heaviness/pain, bloating, loss of appetite. I'm getting a little worried about partial bowel obstruction, especially given that it seems that people with IBD are more prone to that kind of situation. It doesn't help that I've also been wanting to get my uterus kind of checked out (mild but increasing period issues).... just have been waiting to talk to my PCP about it. Worried that something funky in there could be causing this issue.  


What should I even do right now to try and bring myself some relief? I don't even know whether to take meds for diarrhea or constipation 😅 since I'm feeling constipated in the way that I can't get everything out, but I'm technically having diarrhea right now.  


I'm a little hesitant bothering my GI over this, given that I've been talking back and forth and back and forth with my GI and other doctors over other health issues, I just don't know if it's even worth to bring up another thing unless I'm on the floor dying or something.",2022-02-28 01:23:13

I have a phone appointment with my GI on Thursday, and already know that I've been referred for my third colonoscopy.

A brief timeline:

* July 2020: Had extremely bad constipation and lower right abdominal pain. PCP did a CT that showed constipation, ileus, and dilated small bowel loops. He sent me to the ER a few days later and the dilated small bowel loops had disappeared.
* August 2020: Had an intake appointment with GI. Fecal calprotectin came back very slightly high above normal and my vitamin D and B12 were a little low. Started having diarrhea more than constipation. GI told me to drink water and eat fiber and schedule a colonoscopy for November just in case I needed it. 
* November 2020: Had the colonoscopy, which showed ulcers in my ileum with clear biopsies. I was then sent for pillcam and CT enterogram. The pillcam found some evidence of bleeding in my jejunum, but not much and didn't make it to my ileum. The CT enterogram showed a small area of inflammation in my ileum. 
* December 2020: GI says it's probably mild IBD but is stumped by the clean biopsies. She puts me on a 3 month trial of budesonide to see if it helps my symptoms. I have notable changes for the better in fatigue and bowel movements and slowly backslide as I taper off. 
* February 2021: push colonoscopy. This time everything is clear, except my biopsies show acute inflammation. GI says it's still suspicious for mild or early stage Crohn's and gives me the option of 6 months on budesonide or nothing to see if I get sicker. I choose to do nothing.
* May 2021: B12 has tanked from 360 in August to 235 in May. A follow-up calprotectin is totally normal. 
* July 2021: MR enterogram is clear. GI says it's IBS now and tells me to come back if anything changes. 
* July 2021-current: symptoms are stable but sucky. I have fatigue to my bones and about 80% of my BMs are diarrhea and usually 2-3 times a day. Nowhere near symptoms I hear on here. However, I went in to my PCP last week because I started having blood in the toilet--she found a hemorrhoid that's bleeding, and said that my rectal wall looked patchily inflamed. She sent a message to my GI, who immediately said that she wanted to see me ASAP and referred me for a colonoscopy. I also got a CBC for an unrelated reason and my platelets are 451, up from \~350 for the last 4 years (everything else is normal). 

\--

TL;DR: suspicious for IBD but mild symptoms, and my last round of tests didn't find anything with no changes in symptoms. Is it still worth going through with a colonoscopy given that my symptoms haven't changed at all? I'll do it, I just don't want to go through the whole big process of blood tests and scopes and stuff if it's not likely that things will have changed.",2022-03-01 23:41:50

Hello everyone, i’m a 20 year old male asking for help, if anyone is experiencing or knows anything, advice is highly appreciated.

I will keep it short and simple 

About 3 years ago, i’ve had on and off pain with my digestive system. i’ve been diagnosed with stomach ulcers (Helicobacter pylori) and since been treated roughly 2 years ago. 

For the past year i’ve experienced gut burning and blood in my stool occasionally, it comes and goes every so often. i also have gotten blood/stool/x-ray tests and they all came back normal.

Currently for the past 3-4 weeks i’ve gotten sudden constipation (never had before), and been treated with laxative and Relaxa (polyethylene glycol 3350 powder). I’ve taken it for a week straight as recommended by a doctor. So far i’ve been able to use the bathroom multiple times but still have the feeling of constipation and incomplete bowel movement. i am worried because this week i’ve noticed intestinal popping sounds frequently, nausea, chest pains, right abdominal pain, lower left abdominal pain, abnormal smelling stool and dry throat.


i have also noticed a distinctive smell from my breath everyday now and also have gotten random middle spine pain and left neck and head soreness started happening today and also have right upper thigh soreness for 3 days in addition nose and throat feel like something stuck for 3 days too (i don’t know if they correlate)

i just feel generally unwell. Thanks for reading i will reply to all comments!!",2022-03-01 22:21:24

The interviews can be completely anonymous and will be held over Zoom - you do not need to turn on your camera ever. I will turn on my camera (and tell you my full name) though, so that you know exactly who I am, in the interest of full disclosure.

If you are interested, I ask only that you be over 18 years old, and that you have been officially diagnosed with IBD, Crohn's, or Ulcerative Colitis.

There will be at least two interviews, each about an hour or so long, occurring about once a month. The first interview should happen as soon as possible. The interviews will be recorded, but will never be shared with anyone.

I am conducting these interviews to write an essay for a class. This essay will focus on the experiences of those with IBD, specifically experiences with medical professionals, medicine, and people without IBD.

Please DM me or comment below if you want more information - I will be happy to provide it. If you want to read my full proposal for this essay (which details exactly what my essay will be about), please ask.

Edit: I am using a throwaway account but I will tell you who I am once we start working together.",2022-03-07 20:27:11

My last calprotectin test in February came back around 750, and an MRI in 2021 showed left-sided colitis, which means I have an active flare, but due to bad experiences in the medical system, I have resisted medication/treatment for around 12 years, during which time my state of health has gradually worsened to its current state. I am now seeing a gastroenterologist again and weighing up treatment options. 

My main problem now is that my small bowel transit is sooo fast, that I have to run to the bathroom (loose stools, sometimes with mucus and blood, depending on food eaten) just 30 minutes- 1 hour after attempting to eat. Because of this, I mainly subsist on a liquid diet, because it just doesn't seem like I'm digesting food properly. I told my gastroenterologist about my rapid bowel transit, but for some reason, he does not believe it is possible it could be that fast and that the food I just ate 1 hour ago is really coming out that quickly. 

Just wondering if anyone else with Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis has had issues with rapid bowel transit/mal-digestion of food and what it typically means in terms of IBD? 

I did a brief search on the internet but can't seem to find much about rapid bowel transit in IBD, other than that it could point to inflammation. Can medication fix this issue? I looked into getting FMT, but it seems hard to obtain if you have Crohn's. Can diet, probiotics or supplements help?",2022-03-07 07:08:10

Hey all,

I created this account because at this point it seems like there is no semblance of privacy anymore in my search for workplace insurance. I have had UC since 2012 and in 2021 had to go on marketplace insurance, Oscar - which I've paid $0 for! Great so far. Then I went into a bad flare that has lasted for a year and a half now. Long story short, beginning of 2022 all of my doctors stopped taking Oscar and I had to stop receiving my Entyvio infusions.

2 weeks ago, my beloved part time job offered me a full time position. I hoped all my problems would be solved by getting employer insurance. Turns out, my boss has been doing HRA (reimbursement) programs with the other employees, but wants to start a group plan. He has put me in charge of finding a good plan, even though I am not remotely versed in healthcare. I haven't told him about my UC.

I've been reaching out to different health insurance agents to find a small business plan. The agents all ask for the medical history of the employees. When I tell them I have UC, they backtrack and say I have to be on a different plan. I just spoke to another agent on the phone who said that if I get on a workplace plan without telling the insurance company about my preexisting condition and then in a month or so start applying for eligibility for my infusions again, I'll be in trouble.

Does anybody in this community have experience with this? Am I listening to the right people? All I want to do is get decent insurance, even if it doesn't cover my Entyvio (I can apply for grants). But I don't understand the legalities of companies asking about preexisting conditions. It seems like if I got a new job and the employer already offered insurance this wouldn't be an issue, I could just get on the plan no matter what. Does anyone know of a UC healthcare/insurance advocate that could help me with this? My boss is expecting me to set up a new plan and I don't know how to continue.

Thank you so much, you've always made me feel less alone in this.

I have a long history of GI issues. Started probably when I was 17 or 18 - super mild - just some occasional nausea, diarrhea, bloating, occasional bleeding with BMs but just assumed it was hemorrhoids, etc. I found certain foods would trigger it (wheat/grains, anything fatty or fried) and eventually got fed up and decided to try going gluten free when I was 18-22. Didn’t really have too many GI issues then, I actually felt amazing, but still had tons of joint pain (I’ve had joint pain forever, started when I was 16 around the time I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism). 

Once I started eating a regular diet again, my GI issues came back and have very slowly been getting worse over the years. I’ll go through flares where i’m unwell and then stretches where I feel totally fine. 

About a year ago, I was in a phase where things were the worst they’ve been. It started with painful bowel movements & bleeding - felt like I was shitting out glass. Then came diarrhea with mucus and blood, painful abdominal cramps, stabbing pains beside my bellybutton and in lower right quadrant, nausea, crazy bloating, decreased appetite. But no urgency, and the diarrhea was quite infrequent (at this time it was maybe 6-10 times a month - almost every time it happened, it was in the middle of the night, I’d wake up with severe/painful abdominal cramps and nausea then have diarrhea). Went to the doctor. My CRP was elevated. Got a colonoscopy, they said they saw nothing but my biopsies showed mild inflammation. Then my symptoms quickly resolved. Got a referral at that time to a gastroenterologist but the appointment is not until June. 

Since then I’ll randomly get the midnight diarrhea with mucus or blood in it, cramping, stabby pains around my bellybutton and in lower right quadrant, joint pain, decreased appetite, bloating, etc. It comes and goes. The last month or two it’s been getting bad again but honestly it’s manageable. I can still go to work and live my life, I just feel crappy and would like to feel better 😂

My GP can’t move up my referral and I’m looking for suggestions/insight as to what might be going on. They didn’t think it was UC or crohns because I don’t have the urgency/crazy frequency with my diarrhea. I really only have diarrhea episodes maybe 2-10 times a month when I’m symptomatic, but sometimes it’ll come on seemingly out of no where when I’m in a phase of feeling well. I also don’t get fevers, no eye issues, no weight loss. Occasional canker sores but no mouth sores otherwise. They also don’t think it’s IBS because they think it’s weird my diarrhea always wakes me up in the middle of the night, and nothing was ever mentioned about celiac. 

I have autoimmune hypothyroidism. My uncle has ulcerative colitis. My dad has had polyps removed. 

Is this maybe crohns or UC? Or do you guys think it’s more likely pointing to something else? If so, what? I’m open to any info/guidance! Thanks in advance, I appreciate it 💕☺️ and I’m an infrequent user of Reddit so if there’s somewhere else I should post, just let me know 😂",2022-03-13 23:36:57

So dry I have to trouble because I have no spit to swallow and I choke on the dryness. I’m trying to avoid IV fluids but that seems to be the only thing in the past that has worked. I got liters last time and didn’t even pee until an hour or so after. 

Is it possible to hydrate at home during a bleed or is going in for fluids the only option that works? I’m calling gastroenterology and rheumatology asap, but I’m trying to avoid the ER because I’m on strong immunosuppressive drugs. 

Tips and tricks appreciated, but doctor IS going to be aware it’s just hard to get in touch in a Sunday and the on call doctor isn’t always superb.",2022-03-13 23:12:13

Despite stopping the dairy and going back to my old diet, the diarrhea hasn’t stopped. Any ideas on what’s going on and what to do?",treembame,13,tcysth,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/tcysth/went_on_a_prolonged_strict_eliminationfodmap_diet/,9,"Went on a prolonged strict elimination/FODMAP diet. I tried to reintroduce dairy and got diarrhea after the second day. Despite stopping the dairy and going back to my old diet, the diarrhea hasn’t stopped. Any ideas on what’s going on and what to do? 

I went on a very strict elimination diet due to severe esophagitis and dysphagia due to severe gerd and possible EOE. I also have what is diagnosed as IBS, but haven’t had a colonoscopy yet. I cut out all possible food allergens like soy, dairy, gluten, fish, eggs, nuts and all GERD forbidden food like beans, lentils, tomatoes, etc. I pretty much ate only soft bland vegetables. I lost a lot of weight, but the esophagitis and dysphagia  improved tremendously. I stayed on this diet for 6 months because the acid reflux  is still bad. I was able to reintroduce eggs, nuts, and soy and vegetables and fruits I had cut out like broccoli and mangoes no issues. 

However, when I reintroduced dairy, hell broke loose. I introduced lactose free cheese thinking it would be easier. I ate too much at once and should have staggered it. After the first day, I had diarrhea which got progressively worse to the point that it was completely loose with undigested food. Before this, my bowels were soft and full and regular except for a few days here and there with constipation. I stopped the dairy after 3 days. The diarrhea stopped, and I did not have a bm for 4 days. Then for 2 days, it was hard pebbles. However, after that, the diarrhea and cramps have started again, every time I eat, although not as loose as before and no undigested food. I have not had dairy since and my diet has been all the foods I was able to eat fine before I introduced the dairy. 

I’m having diarrhea all day, I’ve tried only eating plain foods, I’ve tried eating no foods at all, and just drinking foods. Nothing is working to stop the diarrhea. 

Any idea why the diarrhea has started up again even though I haven’t had dairy since? It’s been a week and a half since I had the dairy. Did I majorly screw up my micro biome? Cause some kind of allergy/intolerance/histamine reaction? Trigger some kind of immune disorder? Is this like some form of c dificcile?",2022-03-13 05:18:34

I had severe diarrhea for almost a year at that point, and it finally stopped at the beginning of 2020 and I went back to my usual 1-2 times a day of regular stool, and no stomach pain.

Since November 2021, I’ve been having more bouts of diarrhea again with lots of mucous and undigested food, 3-10 times a day or more. But, I also seem to have days of almost normal stools, and even sometimes I feel constipated. Usually the constipation feeling comes the day after a particularly rough day and night of diarrhea.

I contacted my GI and he’s prescribing me Budesonide as long as my stool tests come back negative for infection/parasites.

My worry though is that maybe this isn’t a flare? My first time around it was non-stop diarrhea with no normal days or constipation. This time seems more mild and I even worry that I’m just overthinking it or being dramatic about my symptoms lol which sounds dumb. Like I just don’t want to take the medication if I’m not completely sure it’s a flare.

Does anyone else experience any normal days during a flare, or is this just my new normal? Would you try the medication and see if it goes away completely? Thanks in advance!!",2022-03-16 15:39:22

I (30M) am having my first colonoscopy tomorrow and this prep thing is really awful.  The dr prescribed SUTAB for this - I thought it’d be less bad than the liquid, but I am having a tough time.  Having a lot of pain - 8/10.  Also nauseous.  I feel closer to vomiting than pooping.  Is this normal?  Reason for colonoscopy is painless bloody BM/diarrhea along with myriad of other symptoms since Jan 1.  (Dr said my GI sx sound sort of like Crohn’s but also sort of not.)  I’m supposed to drink another 16oz of water imminently and idk how I’m not going to barf it up.  This all seems like a terrible idea for a person after not eating all day!!  (Some instructions said you can have a light breakfast today - mine said I could not.)  I hardly drink this much water in a normal day and am somewhat concerned for hyponatremia (have had numerous episodes in my lifespan.)

Any tips to make this less bad?

Bonus question: I am not having anesthesia tomorrow because I am a single guy and don’t have anyone to babysit me.  (Idk why clinics don’t offer like a pay-for service to take you home if that’s your situation…)  If I’m in pain now, is it going to be really, really bad tomorrow?

He hasn't ever passed out, thankfully, but it's definitely still a prevalent problem. He also gets winded more easily currently, because he's lost a lot of stamina with this flare. And when he gets winded, he always gets lightheaded, but sometimes he gets lightheaded without getting winded. He has been attributing the feeling of lightheadedness to consistent blood loss in his stool for well over a month at this point, probably more like two (he's in recovery now, though, and it's getting better).

Many years ago, after a kidney stone, I did a regular 24-hour urine, which I found pretty straightforward.  But for this test, there's a whole list of foods one has to avoid for three days before the collection date (and the day itself, of course).  

I've sorted out that I can't have any caffeine (which will be a literal headache), and I rarely eat any of the foods listed - but I did a bit of research, and I've also uncovered a ban on alcohol, antihistamines (which I take at night for my allergies and to help me sleep), and muscle relaxants (I take a small dose at night for a variant of restless leg syndrome).

So now I'm looking at having a caffeine withdrawal headache for four days *and* potentially not being able to sleep for several nights, thanks to the demands of this test.

This comes as a shocker to me and my GI since I never had such before prior surgery. I’m close to 3 months out.

Before surgery, I would eat some cheesy pasta and all sorts of stuff. Bloating usually eventually subsides. Stool test pcr shows no inflammation except some candida overgrowth. I had no constipation but mostly bouts of GI issues like reflux and bloating which could be attributed to my compression syndrome (SMAs).

After surgery to fix my compression issue via resection, I had worser bloating and occasional heartburn symptoms depending on food I eat, and something new such as constipation.

My GI doctor is suspecting it’s possible that I have an infection strain that isn’t detected in the stool test and prescribed me antibiotics. If not it’s possibly IBD.

Anyone had similar issues before?

**UPDATE**: Doctor does not think it’s IBD because calprotectin dropped after one month from 1000 to 200 ish on flagyl and augumentin.

For past years, I had incidences of diarrhea (mostly connected to stress) but, ten years ago I had diarrhea that I could not stop for a month or so, with pain In right lower abdomen - it was really weak pain, and when I was trying to focus on it - it was gone every time. After the time, it stopped, and it didn’t come back - I mean I had days when I felt it, but I could count it on one hand. Then, 5 years ago, I had again the same - but it went away quicker, after about 2 weeks. For all of this time, I was also struggling with ulcers in my mouth and dry skin.

But things got a bit crazier 2 weeks ago - I got the symptoms again after heavy stress, but this time, after having normal diarrhea for half of the day, in the second half - I got diarrhea with blood (and I mean it was not huge but, significant amount) and then, was pooping only blood and mucus. I took some drugs to block diarrhea, and it was gone for a few days. But during the first bowel movement, I got a dark clot with poo. Since then, diarrhea came back, but no blood.

Has anyone had a bowel resection/bowel surgery without doing a bowel prep? How did it go?

I have to do the bowel prep tomorrow before my surgery Tuesday and I’m so nervous.

I’ve done 1 bowel prep successfully before a colonoscopy (pico salax) and attempted another bowel prep (peg lyte) before another colonoscopy.

Even with anti-nausea medication, I could NOT stomach the peg lyte. Even tiny sips came back up seconds after swallowing and hitting my stomach. It was awful. I maybe was able to get half a glass down in total but it was all thrown up anyways.

They are making me do peg lyte again as they said pico salax will dehydrate me. I have warned them I am nervous that I won’t be able to do it because last time it just didn’t sit well in my stomach and each sip I would immediately almost throw up.

I’m just super worried that i’m the event I can’t complete it, my surgery is going to be awful and full of risks.

I also asked if I can take a laxative before the peg lyte just in case I can’t complete it at least that way my bowels will be a bit cleaner but I was told no.

It’s definitely not a “mind over matter” situation. It just doesn’t sit in my stomach. I tried so hard last time and it was awful. Almost makes me want to cry thinking about it because it was just horrible throwing up so much. 

Does anyone have experience NOT doing a bowel prep before surgery? Were there any complications? 

I’m kinda freaking out. Any answers would be so appreciated.",2022-03-21 01:13:11

Ive had GI issues for years and the doctors kept calling it IBS. Last October I had extreme bloody diarrhea and they checked calprotectin after the bleeding stopped and it was high. My ANA was also high and I had persistently elevated lipase which they still cant figure out why (pancreas is fine) They did a colonoscopy and endoscopy and found that I had esophageal candidiasis which they could not figure out how i got. I had internal hemorrhoids but other than that the colonoscopy and biopsies were normal. They did MR enterography and other scans that also came back normal. 

A few months later they figured out I have a different autoimmune disease (AS), and i started sulfasalazine to help with peripheral joint pain. It didn't do much for that but my GI symptoms practically went away, which I was not expecting! I had to stop the sulfa for about a week and the diarrhea came back, calprotectin was still elevated. I went back on the sulfa and it all went away again.

My rhuem thinks its IBD and that the biopsies missed it but my GI dr is calling it IBS still. Sulfasalazine wouldn't help if it was IBS though. Im starting a biologic soon for the AS so if I do have IBD  it should be helped with that.

Im wondering if anyone else has had negative scans but ended up being diagnosed later. Can the scans and colonoscopy miss it? 

Do I really even need to worry about getting an official diagnosis since im already going to be on a biologic? Im not sure if I should worry about it being missed or not.",2022-03-22 07:50:42

I'm a long time lurker on here and thought I'd ask a couple of questions since I'm sort of losing my mind. I am yet to be diagnosed (in the process actually). My symptoms include: moderate amount of urgency, loose and floating stools, bloating, stomach rumbling while lying down and when I am stressed, weight loss. On two different occasions I noticed blood in my stool (on the stool just a peanut size). I went to the GP and got some tests done. Both my calprotectin level (223) and my ESR (22) were elevated and for this reason I was referred to see a GI specialist, although he doesn't think I have IBD (I go once or twice to the bathroom, which is a difference as previously I would only go once every other day). I am also slightly anaemic. 

Unfortunately since I am in the UK, I have an appointment only towards the end of July. I am not looking for a diagnosis as I know I have to wait to get scoped and reviewed by the specialist. Just wondering:

1. Is it okay to wait for that long for the appointment with the specialist? Do you think the wait will make it worse?
2. When exactly do I go to the A&E (ER in the UK). Is it only when I start seeing a lot of blood in my stool?",2022-03-24 11:56:26

I wanted to get some suggestions on medications to possibly bring up to my doctor to help me stay in remission. 

Here is my IBD background:
I was diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis, which is inflammation of the lower part of the colon and rectum. It’s very similar to ulcerative colitis. During my flares I usually experience cramping, urgency, irregular bowl movements, and bleeding. I started to experience this when I was 18, I’m now 23 and have had a flare almost every year that will last anywhere from 3 to 9 months. This past year I was doing really good. This was my longest remission period (10 months!!) and recently I started noticing the signs and realized I’m in a flare up. Idk if it was triggered by stress at work or what makes it come back, but I’m taking my mesalamine suppositories again and reverting back to my safe foods. 

For some additional general health info: I’m very active. I was an athlete through out high school and college, and I still continue to participate in my sport on top of working out 5 days a week. I also eat pretty healthy, very limited dairy (unless I get a good cheese at Whole Foods <3) and not a very big red meat eater. 

I would love any suggestions for medications that people have been taking that has successfully kept them in remission for long periods and/or if anyone has any suggestions on how to get back into remission quickly. The shortest my flares have been are 3 months, and like most people, I want to be back in remission asap.

I was diagnosed with IBS when I was a young teen (12-13) and I have been content with that diagnosis and have been treating it ever since. But lately I have been questioning this diagnosis. I am getting a colonoscopy in a few months and I understand you can’t diagnose but I wanted to hear your thoughts on this, and if maybe anything resided. 


So my episodes consist of both constipation and diarrhea. Sometimes just constipation or diarrhea, sometimes both at the same time. The episodes last for hours sometimes or are as short as around 45 mins. The pain is excruciating, and has brought me to tears on many occasions. I can only describe this pain as my gut committing self suicide and ripping itself out. All I can do is expel whatever demonic thing I have within me and wait out the pain. I get excessive bloating and the gas pains hangs around even when I’m not in an episode. I get occasional nausea but I’ve never puked or anything from it. (Usually during an episode or if my gut doesn’t approve of something I had eaten), it fades usually in an hour. I also get hot with hives but that usually goes away within an hour. 

My stools are super inconsistent and can be anything, but lately I have gotten blood (maybe?) in my stool. I do have hemroids but I haven’t felt any pain from the one that I  KNOW about. It’s a light red or orange and seems to be leaking from the stool or around it. I’m really worried about this and honestly its what made me reconsider my diagnosis. 

What do you guys think? Does this reside with your symptoms at all or does the IBS diagnosis still seem most likely?

Make sure you clear your damn bowel. With the laxatives your are given make sure everything is clear about it. Make sure it’s still in date and used with the exact instructions. If not you will seriously regret it. Today I went in for my colonoscopy but I didn’t think I was going to do it because my medicine didn’t work .(didn’t use the toilet at all even with taking laxatives). I was hoping that I would just get given different laxatives and would come back another day. Well lord have mercy I was wrong. I got given a enema. A nozzle is pushed up your ass and liquid is squeezed in. It’s not as bad as it seems but it was definitely very uncomfortable but it worked pretty well. The worst part about this liquid is that you have to hold the nozzle in your bottom for about 10 mins and you feel the liquid entering. After 2-3 mins I screamed at the nurse to take it out due to the really uncomfortable feeling. I used the toilet after and about half a bottle was able to clear me out. But the nurse insisted that I used the rest of it which would result in me having to have the bottle in my bottom for about 10 mins. I told the nurse that I’m pretty sure I was clear and was not going to have that nozzle put in my ass again or I was going to pull out and not do the colonoscopy. So she called the doctors and I told him that the poo was completely clear like water. He told me that we would just do the colonoscopy again and I would have to use that nozzle again. For most of you who are doing it tue laxatives will work so don’t worry about this. As long as you clear your bowels your chill. The procedure it’s self was really good. Had a student nurse put numbing cream on my hands so when they put the anesthesia in I didn’t feel a thing. After the procedure I was given crisp, sandwich and jelly . For anyone who is doing this please don’t worry it’s a breeze and feel free to ask me questions",2022-03-29 17:54:19

I thought it was a stomach bug, but it was lasting an unusually long time. No blood in my stool, however I was shitting liquid around 6 times a day. 

6 days in (21 March), I started a course of 5 day course of anti-biotics along with a 2 day course of anti-diarrhea medication. Within one day (22 March) I noticed substantial improvement and after 2 days my symptoms disappeared. Fever stopped, cramps stopped, I regained my appetite, my stool was normal-ish (solid but in small pieces/nuggets) and I was only shitting once a day. 

I completed my anti-biotic course on Friday, 25th March. Felt great over the weekend, then on Monday, 28th March I developed a fever and diarrhea again. The GI issues were not as severe as the last time, minimal stomach cramping and only pooping twice a day. But my poop was liquid and I was once again feeling ill and flu-ish. 

On Tuesday 29th March I went for a blood test, and the results showed signs of both infection and inflammation (no anemia). So my GP suspects that I may just have a bacterial infection (which didn't fully die during the first antibiotic course) and prescribed a second 5-day antibiotic course. I've started this course today (Wednesday, 30 March).

However, since both my parents have ulcerative colitus, my GP said that there's still a high chance of ulcerative colitus and recommended that I go to a gastro if things don't improve (or return again).

So right now it's just a waiting game. Any opinions?",2022-03-30 23:43:53

2878,UPDATE: Marijuana Usage for IBD Symptoms,menacingdoor,23,tshcnw,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/tshcnw/update_marijuana_usage_for_ibd_symptoms/,8,"Hey everyone. First off, I want to sincerely thank everyone who not only took the [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/tps1lo/marijuana_usage_for_ibd_symptoms/), but also took time out to provide details about your experience. For those interested, I wanted to provide a summary of the results below, purely for educational purposes.

POLL RESULTS:

* Of the **251** people who responded, **121 (or \~48% of)** people responded that marijuana helps with symptoms.

KEY INSIGHTS FROM COMMENTS:

* The primary use case for marijuana was **pain management**
* Marijuana is by no means a cure, but rather a **complement** to traditional treatment
* People have their own preference with respect to what form of marijuana (edible vs. vape vs. flower) works best (i.e. responses were across the board)

PERSONAL THOUGHTS:

Seeing almost 50% of people with IBD finding relief with marijuana is incredible, and access to marijuana for you should be easy and seamless. I understand that there have not been enough scientific studies done but frankly there are so many substances out there that have been shown to be far worse. Just upsets me that my friend has to go on the streets to find something he's found incredibly helpful for him and it seems like he's not alone.

This year I've been having more complications, a big one being chronic constipation,

I've previously been tested for crohns in the last few yrs which was negative, so colitis looks more like whats going on, still have more tests to come, meds to get on, but that's a waiting game.
Another thing I'm confused with, is that my symptoms are different to the regular ones, like diarrhoea is never a symptom for me, always the opposite, and bloody stools, doesn't happened, only has the tiniest bit once, does anyone else relate to this?
Its hard finding anything similar to what im dealing with online, thought here with real people would be a good bet.
In the mean time while waiting for far away appointments and help, I have to completely change my diet with no help to get some sort of relief, so I guess if any was has any diet tips for flare ups it would be greatly appreciated
Im clearly gluten and dairy intolerant as is, can handle small amount of dairy, and although a low fibre diet as recommended usually is probably more dangerous for my specific situation, though fibre causes serious pain, I need the fibre for the constipation symptoms, im in a confusing pickle when it comes to food now.

TL;DR symptomatic for 6 months, tests coming back clear, inflammation in intestines, dismissive and unprofessional doctor

Since November 2021, I have been struggling with a bunch of different symptoms. Nausea, diarrhea 6+ times a day, urgent need to poop immediately after eating, and abdominal pain. I have a very stressful job and know that my anxiety manifests physically at times, so I ignored these symptoms for a while assuming they were just manifestations of anxiety. After I started calling out of work because I couldn’t stop going to the bathroom, I finally scheduled a consult with a GI doctor in December. 

He ran the full panel for blood work and everything came back completely fine. I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia ~7 years ago and have received monthly vitamin B12 shots ever since. So other than that, everything was fine. My partner has celiac so I already naturally eat GF most days, but I tried all those routes as well to identify triggers. There was nothing noticeable. 

I got a colonoscopy in January. It came back completely clear. My doctor’s next plan was to schedule me for a SIBO test. I never got the test because a week before my appointment, I ended up in the ER. I was having explosive diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for three days straight and could not keep food or water down. The ER did a CT scan with IV contrast, and found inflammation in my intestine. I was told I had terminal ileitis, and the doctor said since he’s not a specialist, he can’t give me a concrete diagnosis, but that this is exactly what they see with Crohn’s. 

I took the results to my GI doctor and he scheduled me for a capsule endoscopy. I ended up waiting almost a month for this while they got insurance approval. While I waited, I was given Zofran for nausea but otherwise was told they couldn’t do anything for me until the procedure. The medicine didn’t help too much and I ended up losing 12 pounds over the next two weeks because I could barely eat. I spent weeks in pain, missing days of work at a time, until I finally got the endoscopy. 

I got the call yesterday saying my endoscopy came back completely clear. My doctor stated “maybe you just have irritable bowel syndrome, you know?”. I was surprised by how dismissive he was, but he asked how my symptoms were and I recounted everything. He again offered Zofran, and I said it was really the pain and diarrhea that was bothering me. He responded saying “oh you’re in pain?” and when I said “yes, it put me in the ER”, he acted as if he had no idea that I was in the ER. Which is extremely concerning considering that ER trip is what led to the discovery of intestinal inflammation and terminal ileitis diagnosis, and it makes me worry that he hasn’t even looked at those scans because he clearly doesn’t remember any of that. 

He said the only other thing he can do is the SIBO test. So he had me call to schedule that. And they can’t get me in for another 6 weeks. I’m at my breaking point here. All of my symptoms and my CT scans point to a very high likelihood of Crohn’s, yet my doctor is not seeing anything. 

I am miserable most days. In and out of the bathroom, and unable to get out of bed some mornings because of the pain I’m in. Afraid to eat literally any and everything because I’m worried it’ll put me in the bathroom all day, or make me nauseous. 

Should I seek a second opinion? Or am I being over reactive? It’s so hard to tell with all of this and I’m so tired of looking for answers or treatment and coming up empty.",2022-04-07 22:41:56

Thank you guys for taking the time to reply, your words mean a lot!! 

Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but I'm gonna go ahead and post this here because I don't know where else I could go. I would appreciate it if you read this because I feel lost.  I'm 19F and I've been having bloody stools and diarrhea for the past 5 months.

it started last fall. I had a slight change in my bowel movements, but I didn't think much of it until one November day when I literally shit out nothing but blood. I was terrified, but I told my mom and she reassured me that it was normal and if I just eat more vegetables and water it’ll go away. 

So I did. For the month of December, I changed my entire diet. Cut off junk food, caffeine and soda, and drink more water. But without fail, each time I went to use the bathroom, there was always blood.

I was very confused because my appetite was normal. I had no nausea. No dizziness,  no pain. no straining to use the bathroom. I wouldn't know anything was wrong if it wasn’t for the blood. i tried searching up what it could be but i didn’t fit any of the symptoms of the major stuff like IBS, crohn's, ulcerative colitis etc

but i was afraid of going to the doctors because well, i was completely clueless. I didn't know who to call or what to say, and my parents were no help because they didn’t want me going to the doctors in the first place. I stalled for so long because I had anxiety about looking like an idiot. I don't know what changed, but I realized that I had to put my health over my pride, so I sucked it up and called a clinic near me. 

So in January, I went to my primary doctor. She ordered a blood/stool test and told me she would refer me to a specialist. which confused me because she never gave me a number/ name and no one ended up calling me.

I did surprisingly well taking the blood test, but on the stool test, not so much. Maybe it’s immature of me but I was very disgusted, I was holding down vomit the whole time I was scooping it.

I sent in my samples, and anxiously waited but I did not hear back for weeks. I have NO idea how this all works so I figured I had to call back. I scheduled another appointment in February, where I met with a different doctor.

nothing came back on my blood or stool. In fact, it was showing great things. no anemia, no risk of diabetes, normal cholesterol levels etc. my doctor pretty much just praised my genetics, told me he didn’t know what was wrong with me and not to worry because people my age don’t get colon cancer. I told him about how I was starting to have abdominal discomfort and persistent diarrhea, and so he just prescribed me medications that would “stop contractions” and harden my stool.  Asked about a specialist and again I never got a name, number or call. 

I felt very brushed off. I never took the pills because honestly I did not like the idea of taking medication without even knowing what the exact issue was. i fear it would just make things worse

Those 2 appointments and the lab tests already had me tired of going to doctors so I got the mindset that maybe I could fix this myself. I switched from diet to diet, trying to see if anything would improve it. I chugged water all day, exercised, cut off everything that could possibly be harmful. but nothing changed. In fact, things were just getting worse. 

Now I wasn’t even passing anything solid, I was going to the toilet 3-4 times a day and each time, more and more blood came up. It smelled awful too.

The worst part is that i couldn't tell anyone about these struggles, i had to go to school and smile and interact with people ignoring how i was literally having bloody diarrhea everyday. 

So around march, i had a breakdown in front of my mom, just sobbing about how exhausted and terrified i was. and all she did was suggest ways i could change my diet and say that it’ll eventually go away. and I felt even worse after crying to her. I was just thinking why no one else was as concerned as I was. Shitting blood is NOT normal and it cant be fixed with a stupid diet

so i called my primary doctors again, angrier this time because i wanted something to be done. I met the same doctor and I tried to be more demanding that time. 

The doctor felt my stomach (which he didn’t do last time) and said he felt a mass but “wasn’t sure” and that I needed to get a CT scan as soon as possible. He gave me sheets of papers with dozens of locations. 

scheduling that was a nightmare. i made a call to one place and they hung up on me, i assume because i kept asking dumb questions (which i do because of anxiety) other places offered an appointment several months from now and i finally got one scheduled within a week, but i remember hearing something about my insurance not being accepted and i’ve been worrying about that. (I have no idea how insurance works either). I also checked my appointment on their website and they completely messed up my name, even though I remember spelling it out for them. and now i’m just thinking how that’s gonna cause issues. the appointment is in 2 days and i don’t know if that’s enough time to fix it

Finally, I was able to get a number to a specialist, where they surprisingly got me a next day appointment. Which brings us to today. 

The specialist told me that they think it’s some sort of inflammation. They ordered another blood test, and a stool test that they wanted immediately. They also want to do a colonoscopy somewhere in these next few weeks. 

But I'm in college and the finals are nearing, and I'm dreading thinking about all the classes I have to miss, all the emails I have to send to professors, and the time I'm losing for my final projects. it’s sounds stupid to worry about school at a time like this but i really do value my education. 

I'm also dreading the more phone calls I have to make, and 2nd stool test and especially the colonoscopy. I know it's necessary but it doesn't change how I feel about it. 

It's late at night,  I'm lying in bed, just thinking how awful I feel. I feel so lonely and exhausted. tomorrow I have to go to class, meet up with friends and pretend nothing is wrong. it probably sounds entitled but I feel too young to be dealing with this. I’ve just been praying they find something. There's so much going on that I'm even forgetting that the primary doctor said something about finding a mass in my abdomen. It's all so much and I don't know how to deal with it.

I'm not sure how to end this post. I feel terrible but exploring the subreddit has made me feel better cause it’s easing off the loneliness I feel. And Thank you for reading all of this, it means a lot.",2022-04-13 07:53:07

2937,I feel like I'm too young to be this sick- and I'm tired.,jesseistired,28,u3nohk,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/u3nohk/i_feel_like_im_too_young_to_be_this_sick_and_im/,5,"Hi everyone, I'm new here and this will be my first post. Beware, it is long lol. TLDR at the end.

For a little bit of background, I've kind of always had stomach problems since I was born really (I'm 19 Y/O currently). I was diagnosed with GERD (acid reflux) before I turned 1, and commonly had severe stomach bugs growing up. A few even landed me in the ER. Anyways, fast forward to the last couple years and life just starts hitting me like a truck. I've dealt with a lot of crap, but things have just been so extremely bad for me since the start of the pandemic. 

My mental health took a turn for the worse, and then I started noticing persistent diarrhea that seemed to be related to food triggers. I ignored it, but it only got worse. But then, things in life genuinely started to get better for me around 5 months ago. My mental health improved, I started college, started dating my wonderful wonderful girlfriend, and began looking for a job.

Then... BOOM. One day after going to one of my favorite restaurants in late Jan of this year, (usually gave me mild diarrhea, but this time was worse) I came down with what I suspected had to be food poisoning from undercooked meat. I was having completely liquid bowel movements and extreme diarrhea cramps for about 2 days. After the diarrhea stopped, the pain moved into my lower back and hips. I thought maybe the pain and cramping caused my hips to need an adjustment, so I scheduled an appointment with the chiropractor. Just to explain how bad this pain was though... Y'all, I literally couldn't stand up without shaking. I knew something was seriously wrong, but the adjustment a couple days later almost completely took care of the back pain.

Then comes a Saturday morning about a week later, and I wake up feeling very strange. I hadn't been having diarrhea or any other GI specific symptoms since before the back pain started, but I had been feeling ""spacy"" for the last couple days (sort of hard to explain, but I felt really out of it like I was on psych meds or high). My head was hurting and I was feeling very dizzy, so I decided to eat something and hop in the shower. After sitting in the shower for about 15 minutes, I started feeling even dizzier and very nauseous, then felt my heart rate spike. I started feeling like I was going to pass out, so I jumped out of the shower and wrapped myself in a towel. About 30 seconds later I flung open the toilet lid and started VIOLENTLY vomiting, like full body force for more than a minute. I open my eyes and look down after I'm done, and the bowl is full of bright red blood/blood clots. I think I passed out after that, maybe from exhaustion or maybe just from seeing that horrible sight.

The day goes on and I don't throw up blood again, but I continue vomiting for the rest of the day and can't even hold down water. I also begin having liquid diarrhea again, uncontrollably (like I'm talking leaking into my boxers type of diarrhea). Later into the night I start to lose consciousness, and my family and I agree it's time to take me to the ER. Get to the ER and they treat me like total crap, but that's a story for another time. They do a CT scan and some bloodwork, and determine that I probably have food poisoning. They told me my colon was inflamed and full of fluid, but couldn't see anything else abnormal and that I should see a GI doc ASAP, and sent me home pumped full of antibiotics and anti nausea meds.

Couple days pass and I'm still having the same level of diarrhea, but no more vomiting and no more blood. Head over to the GI doc and he prescribes a powder packet that will stop the diarrhea, and agrees with the ER doc's assessment of my situation. Tells me to come see him again in 2 weeks.

The 2 weeks go by and I slowly get better, but my stomach is still extremely agitated. Still having diarrhea and cramps 2-3 days out of the week. GI doc tells me to take some OTCs (metamucil and another probiotic I can't remember the name of) and come back in another month, and if I'm worse he'll schedule a colonoscopy.

So I take the meds, take extreme care in watching my diet, and try to keep living my life. I start having diarrhea less, but still a couple times a week. Then I start noticing blood in my stool here and there. Then it turns into the occasional blood clot. I see GI doc again, and he hears ""blood in stool"" and says ""Ok, no more questions asked. Hate to do this but you're just not getting to where I'd like you to be. Let's do the colonoscopy and the endoscopy just so we don't miss anything"". This was in late March, and I go ahead and schedule it for mid May, after my classes will be wrapped up.

Literally THE NEXT WEEK, I have another flare-up, but this one is much worse. I start having very very bloody diarrhea with blood clots. My family influenced me to go to the ER that's in the same hospital as my GI doctor to see if I can get them to reschedule my colonoscopy/endoscopy to an earlier date, and get bloodwork and CT scan done just to make sure I'm okay. I was initially reluctant because I felt okay other than the horrible diarrhea, but ended up going anyways the next morning. 

ER found nothing abnormal with CT scan OR bloodwork, and couldn't find any reason for me to get an emergency colonoscopy or admit me. It was incredibly frustrating, and I feel like I lost a whole day for nothing. I was able to reschedule my procedures to April 26th (I guess they magically have earlier dates available for you if you're sicker), and that's where I'm at now.

All my doctors, (PCP, GI, and ER) are assuming I have Crohn's or UC. This is so extremely disheartening to me. I know these conditions are treatable and can sometimes even go undetected because they're so mild, but I know that's not the case for me. I also know the extreme side of UC, because my best friend has it, and it absolutely incapacitated him for over a year. No matter what happens, when they stick those scopes up in me, there's a 90% chance they'll find a chronic illness. If not IBD, then... Something worse, I suppose. I don't like to think of the worst case scenario, but I still find myself worrying about the possibility of having some sort of cancer. It most definitely runs in the family. This mystery illness is pulling my life apart, and I'm so tired and worried, and tired of BEING worried. I just want answers, but it also makes me so sad that I'm ill enough to need these procedures before I'm even 20. I'm falling behind in school, I struggle going anywhere because of constant urgent bowel movements, and I'm starting to feel depressed again.

Advice going into this is appreciated, but I really just needed to vent to strangers who get it. So regardless if you read this or not, thank you for being here. Wish all of you the best.

TLDR; I vomited blood 3 months ago and now I have bloody diarrhea on a regular basis. I'm 19 and I will probably have a chronic illness for the rest of my life :( My upcoming colonoscopy and endoscopy and time will tell.

PS: I will update this post if anyone would like me to after I get my results!",2022-04-14 20:13:22

2940,Signs of IBD? Should I find a new gastroenterologist?,Practical_Season_908,5,u38fn6,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/u38fn6/signs_of_ibd_should_i_find_a_new/,2,"I’ve had gut issues for a while now (extreme daily distension, chronic loose stools, pain) but things took a really dark turn after a COVID infection several months ago. I had several episodes of severe bleeding - like the amount of blood you’d expect to see while on your period. These episodes were during times of constipation though so perhaps they were hemorrhoids. I tend to have an average of one bowel movement each day in the morning that is usually on the looser end and it usually happens after drinking water and I have an urgent need to go (lately I’ve gone less frequently perhaps due to antihistamine use). During my colonoscopy prep yesterday I saw some small black pieces of stool or perhaps it was undigested food. Also saw a little bit of blood in bowl at one point. I am also constantly getting food stuck in my throat and experiencing throat tightness after eating. Post-COVID I can currently only tolerate a handful of low histamine foods without having anaphylaxis symptoms. I have been rushed to the hospital several times, I have been diagnosed with anaphylaxis during some of these events, and prescribed epipens (fortunately have not had to use as Benadryl has always helped and I’ve never gone into anaphylactic shock). I’ve had several urgent care doctors tell me I need to do a scope asap because they think I might have IBD. Also have a lot of undigested food in stool and sometimes mucus. I can also see raw red patches at the back of my throat that I never had prior. 

I was told by the gastroenterologist that I probably just have “functional GI disorder” and not Crohn’s or UC and so a colonoscopy /endoscopy is elective and in other words, probably unnecessary. (He also doesn’t believe that I’m experiencing anaphylaxis lol). Therefore, my colonoscopy/endoscopy was put on hold until I sort out my allergies.  

Do any of you have similar symptoms? Doc thinks the bleeding is likely hemorrhoids. I do have a family history of colon cancer but I haven’t been concerned as much about that due to my age.",2022-04-14 05:51:22

At the ER, I had normal blood tests results that ruled out celiac disease. I also had normal blood sugar levels. Low CRP as well. X-ray was fine as well. They gave me Metronidazole (antibiotics) and Omeprazole for 5days and mebeverine (antispasmodic) to try for 2 weeks. But they told me to get the colonoscopy done ASAP. I tried omeprazole before with no effect. The night after my ER visit, I had 2,3 **spots of blood in my stool** for the first time which has made me anxious.

I had minimal post steroid inflammation due  to being on 4 bags of steroid a day during a 7 day hospital stay, before they could fit me in for the FS. My symptoms are worsening and I now have a blue badge due to some frequent embarrassing public accidents,  and my new consultant has referred me for a full colonoscopy to investigate further. I am being sedated but I am petrified. The Flexible sigmoidoscopy was so traumatic and painful due to already being in severe pain and the lack of any sedation that any time I think of it I begin panicking, teary and feeling like I’m going to vomit. I tried to explain this to my consultant who laughed me off and told me I denied sedation the first time. I explained that no I was told I couldn’t have it and given Entonox which didn’t help much other than me being a confused wailing mess on the bed as the procedure happened. 

A few things: I’m really frightened of the full colonoscopy that it is going to be just as bad an experience or that I will clam up and panic too much for them to do it. I’ve got to start prep tomorrow which is also filling me with dread as I’ve only just got over recent flair ups and am already super tender and sore. I have been given Picolax which I’m hoping is a more pleasant experience than the Enema I had in hospital. I’m also really worried that as I’ve been on my meds due to a recent flare up they won’t see much and even though day to day my symptoms aren’t great whilst they suddenly feel settled they will revoke my diagnosis. I can’t cope without my meds and have a blue badge to enable me to park nearer facilities and don’t want to lose this. My partner seems to think as the biopsies were conclusive last time that this shouldn’t happen. I’m also petrified they’ll find something more sinister. I’m all over the place to be honest.

Along the time, I have noticed the stigma about poop and basically anything related to the digestive system. We, as a planet, just choose to throw shit (pun intended) at everything that has to do with the functioning of the digestive system, proper or not.

 We think pooping is embarrassing, we think burping, gas, etc. are embarassing.
I've seen numerous diseases romanticed in movies, but that is never gonna be ulcerative collitis.
I think one of the biggest challenge of people with UC is actually the stigma that society has on it because it is, well, ""yucky""...Aren't we having enough on our plate already with all yhe freaking symptoms of it? 
Should we also worry that Jessica and Chad will judge us if we pass gas or spend too much time in the bathroom because ""people will think we are pooping""? Seriously, now! Doesn't everyone poop or is 1 in 2 actually a robot? Because in that case we need to carry captcha tests with us everywhere, haha.

From what I know, most people had some digestive issues at least a few times in their life. Why should I be filled with anxiety that I have to go back to work and maybe I will need to pass gas IN THE BATHROOM (I know it is not the most pleasant to do it in a meeting room). But even so, I don't think that people should be judged for 5 seconds of bad smell coming from a terrible disease that they are facing.

Being a woman, I even feel embarrassed to excuse myself. I cannot say in a meeting: hey, I really need to go now and cannot answer in the next 10 minutes because I am having digestive issues/urgency. It is super uncomfortable and I believe that if we started talking about it more openly, it would be soooo relieving. Because it hurts, both physically and mentally. You cannot imagine the anxiety I have when I  have a flare and I also have a meeting that lasts 1.5hrs instead of the originally scheduled 1 hour and my boss requests me to attend and makes comments if I leave.

Dating as a person with IBD is also awful. I mean, do you know how difficult it is to explain to you significant other that you feel sick because you have bloody diarrhea more times a day and still be considered attractive, when society teaches people that ""girls don't poop""? Or keeping yourself from making sounds from explosive diarrhea when you sleep over at someone? That is a full time job itself.
Like, once I get out of the bathroom I am hot af, why should I worry that what I do in the bathroom by myself will make me less attractive just because of some poor digestion sounds?
But worry not, my healthy friends got this problem, too. Not with diarrhea sounds, but with passing gas and smelly poop. So freaking annoying!!!

I believe people should be more understanding. Besides UC, there is also Chron, IBS, and other digestive issues that need to be accepted in the society. And, moreover, everyone has some days when their poop ain't perfect.
Let's make digestion normal and accepted! But how?

About a week ago, I finished my prednisone taper and am now experiencing a small flare and increased cystic acne. I was wondering if anyone on here with a history of acne and IBD had any tips/advice or could just share their history? Maybe the two aren’t really connected? Not sure.

I was blown off so many times by my PCP and even OBGYN when I first expressed concerns with my GI issues.

For the longest time I was told it was a nervous stomach and to reduce stress and practice mindfulness. I was also told to lose weight or change my eating habits. When those didn't solve the issue it was then I had IBS-D and to watch for triggers. Then it was no it's your gallbladder, so it was removed and minus some thickening and sludge the surgeon said it was one of the better gallbladders he has seen in a while. Stating it looked worse in imagining and the labs. Pathology confirmed that the gallbladder was thickening but not very inflamed.

Then after an ER visit for extreme GI pain they said it was Mesenteric panniculitis (sclerosing mesenteritis). Then Crohn's and now they have no idea. My GI isn't giving up and is fighting for a pill scope currently. I just want to know what is going on. The Imagining and labs show inflammation, scopes did not. My GI believe there is something wrong and has told me there is validation to continue looking but the easy looks are done for now. 

As of right now I have reactive mesenteric lymph nodes seen in two CTs and two MRIs, since September 2021. My WBCs have been elevated in between 11.7-16.2 (since January 2020, I don't know the last time this was normal looking at my labs my WBC is always elevated dating back to 2017), my neutrophils have been elevated since January 2021 at between 8.3-9, high eosinophils between .8-1.0 (since January 2021), my CPR has been at a consistent 18-22 (since January 2021), high platelets count of 485-528 (since Sept 2021), Low MCH (between 23.9-25.4), MCHC (between 30.9-31.2) and MCV (between 76-77) (all have been low since August 2021 even with oral iron supplements), my Sed Rate has been elevated at 51 (September 2021) and 39 (April2022), and finally my calprotectin was 53 as of early this April. 


Currently I have blood while wiping, raging diarrhea (going multiple times , the BM color is bright yellow when I wipe and a lot of mucus.

It's literally 24/7, since it started there hasn't been an hour that goes by where I haven't felt it. Somedays it's worse then others but it's always there.

Right now I'm not on any treatment. Ever since my flare subsided I've been fine and the doctor sufgested as an option to just watch for now before starting a new medication, which would be Infliximab.
Currently I'm feeling perfectly fine but recently we did a calproctectin test and a ultrasound check to see if anything was up and I did have a tiny bit of inflammation but not enough for the doctor to conclusively assess that it's a flare-up. We've decided to check back on it soon for now.

3030,Partner insists that 10yo with UC must always be on a restricted diet,sableenees,16,ucpeho,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/ucpeho/partner_insists_that_10yo_with_uc_must_always_be/,43,"Hi folks, I'm new to r/IBD and looking for help with a conflict in our family. Our child (10F) was diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis a little under a year ago, and has been on Humira for about 3 weeks. Before Humira, she was getting frequent and difficult flares. Now, she's doing great. 

I think I know that when you're having IBD symptoms, you need to watch what you eat, basically so that incompletely-digested food doesn't irritate your colon further. Beyond that is where my partner and I diverge. 

I'm going to try to be as neutral as I can about this. She has been taking our kid to a naturopath, and their big thing is eating a right diet to control inflammation. As far as I can tell, ""inflammation"" is a poorly-defined catch-all in the naturopathy context and not equivalent to the immune response that marks an IBD flare-up. The naturopath recommended various supplements and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for at least a year, maybe two, after symptoms subside. This diet involves no bread, no sugar, no rice, and all sorts of other dietary restrictions. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good diet for weight control and general healthy eating. She also gets into ""if I don't recognize all the ingredients, it's processed food and will make her IBD worse.""

I also understand that my partner has been through the trauma of seeing her baby experience a lot of suffering recently, so I am being patient. She also says that she's been paying attention and tracks flare-ups to bad eating habits. For example, before we started Humira, we went away from the weekend with my mom, who let the kid have a few slices of blueberry bread with her breakfast. The kid had been out of a flare for a few days, but flared back up when we returned. This, my partner attributed to the blueberry bread. All I can say is, weakly, ""correlation isn't causation.""

My partner keeps saying, ""Do your research. You'll see that she needs to control her inflammation at all times."" There are a lot of sites out there that are more than willing to say that, but I like to think I stick to information from recognizable sources, like

[https://www.crohnsandcolitis.com/living-with-crohns-uc/ulcerative-colitis/flare-ups](https://www.crohnsandcolitis.com/living-with-crohns-uc/ulcerative-colitis/flare-ups)

Which says, ""There’s no evidence that food can cause or cure UC, nor is there any evidence that it can cause a flare. But during a flare-up, food can affect your symptoms, and every person with UC is different when it comes to foods or drinks that may aggravate symptoms.""

That seems pretty black-and-white to me. From my own research, I am gathering that, while my child should always eat healthy, there's little if any reason to impose diet restrictions without some initial evidence that she's in a flare. My approach would be to help the kid eat healthy, though without harsh restrictions (she's opting out of birthday cake, for example, regardless of any symptoms), and to limit her diet when she has abdominal pain, diarrhea, etc.

It's really hard to talk someone out of a belief system, and my partner is very into the ""food is health"" movement. I'm definitely into exercise and healthy eating as well, and we've fed our kid home-cooked healthy dinners her whole life. I'm concerned, though, that the naturopath is taking things too far and abusing her desire to make our kid's life more comfortable. It's a ""couldn't hurt"" kind of approach but it's also impinging on a happy childhood.

I'm more than happy to be totally wrong, but if I'm on the right track, I would really appreciate any tips for communicating that with my partner more effectively. More than anything, I don't want my kid to grow up resenting us for imposing arbitrary diet restrictions. I grew up with kids whose parents did that (""allergic to sugar"" kids) and they burned their bridges. Please, if you have any material that will bring either me or my partner around, help us out. ❤",2022-04-27 01:10:47

3035,Proctitis & Prep H Suppository,vg_guy2,4,udwtyl,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/udwtyl/proctitis_prep_h_suppository/,5,"So after having terrible food poisoning, I've had rectal bleeding with normal stools for about 2 years now. 3 'flares' have occurred where I had tons of mucus and managed to turn the toilet red once or twice. I had a colonoscopy done and found out I have proctitis (they called it 'mild chronic colitis of the rectum') and also mild inflammation in my terminal ilium ( could have been NSAIDs/stress ).  Nothing to indicate Crohns and no ulcers. Colon 100% healthy.

I've been trying tons of stuff since last August when I found out including homemade keifer, turmeric/ginger, went on the SCD diet on February 8th and NOTHING will stop the blood. Most of the time is just a tiny pink streak but about once ever 10 days its a fair bit of red. It's driving me nuts!

So I thought maybe they missed some hemorrhoids or something and decided to try Prep H internal suppositories....and the bleeding completely went away...until I stopped using them. 2 weeks of no blood, I couldn't believe it.

Don't know what to think at this point.

Would this indicate the bleeding is coming from my anus and maybe not the proctitis after all?

Can hemorrhoids be missed during a colonoscopy?

Obviously more doctor visits would shed some light so don't suggest that.",2022-04-28 16:53:14

I eat healthy food but when I went to college, I somehow had to stick with outside food from stalls, restaurants and fast food most of the time, 

My mom was pretty strict when we were young about food diet. We would always limit sweets, pork, beef and poultry. She usually didn’t let me drink softdrinks that much or eat so much candy. When she became more lenient in highschool I somehow indulged myself so much to food I liked with my slow metabolism. when I reached college, I even hit 80 kg as my weight as a 5’5 woman. In addition, university is stressful so I don’t have time to work out or exercise. 

Fast forward to 2020, I was diagnosed with IBD. My mom was pretty stressed out about it and the doctor said that there is no definite cause - genetics, environmental and etc. My mom decided to somehow share her thoughts what could be the factors - the way I eat, I don’t go out in the sun so much because of being busy, I don’t exercise regularly, I allowed my immune system to be weak. She is caring but it made me feel like it is entirely my fault why I am sick. 

I got treatment, take vitamins and followed a modified healthy diet, which led to losing weight up until 57 kg. It is also caused by pain and loss of appetite due to flair up. People I know suddenly told me I looked better when I lost weight, which confused my mental state. Now I am feeling a little better so I eat some of the food I like regularly because the two years were really saddening and strict.

Unfortunately, it led to increasing weight by a couple of kilos again and it made me feel guilty plus my mom would keep saying “you are not allowed to eat this and you shouldn’t eat this because it would make you flare up again” followed by factors I mentioned earlier. It made me lose a little bit of control and somehow secretly indulged my self again so my weight increased and I had mild flare ups.  

I feel guilty about weight change, food diet, medical expenses and angry at flare ups 

I just hate how IBD changed my life and I know I should be responsible enough but sometimes it is really hard to keep up with its effects",2022-04-28 06:54:41

I know i could start googling about them but i'm worried i'll read something bad out of context and panic so i thought i'd ask here where i can get the opinion of people actually suffering with it.

I've known something was wrong with me for about 2 years, went to the doctors numerous times, got put on a 2 year waiting list for the hospital, Doc refused lots of test as didn't think they were necessary... Fast forward to a few weeks ago i finally managed to speak to a good doctor and she took a stool sample, urine sample and ordered lots and lots of bloods. Everything came back okay apart from raised amylase (which is a separate issue i'm now panicking about) and the stool sample. Rang me today telling me i have one of them, now being referred for colonoscopy and scan.

So, i don't know much apart from they are forms of IBD and are incurable. I just had a few questions i wondered if some of you may be able to help with:

How bad are these diseases?

How much would you say they affect your quality of life?

Do they reduce life expectancy?

If one was to completely overall their lifestyle (quitting vaping, cardio / resistance training, losing weight / maintaining a healthy weight, eating healthy food instead of processed crap 24/7) what kind of impact would this have on the diseases?

Any advice anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated. I will google it all for myself, i just feel like i'll get more relevant advice from people who live with it.

Many thanks!

Edit - Thought i'd list my symptoms, many of them probably unrelated:

\- Ball pain (epididymitis)

\- Dull ache in my right side that comes and goes, liver / kidney area

\- Pain under my right ribcage now and again, i had attributed it to vaping too much

\- Foamy Urine

\- Constant constipation or diarrhoea

\- Blood when i wipe (although could be angus tears)

\- A severe pain and hardness in my stomach accompanied by severe nausea, rarely though, usually when i haven't eaten. Had attributed it to gas.

\- Really bad pain in my calf that comes and goes

\- Numb heels

\- Also had IBS my whole life

Could I have PSC?,MothMortuary,3,uf8fdt,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/uf8fdt/looking_for_some_reassurance_and_kind_words_could/,17,"On 3/23/22 I got my gallbladder removed. Before this I had elevated liver enzymes and it was assumed that it was due to my gallbladder, so was hoping to see them readjust after removal. Went for my follow up today, was told that they found some stuff that makes them worry I may have a sclerosis disease such as PSC. I am quite the hypochondriac due to my generalized anxiety disorder so of course after the appointment I fell into a rabbit hole of medical websites and horror stories related to the condition.

To say the least, I wailed like a baby the entire way home. Mom (bless her heart) wound up having to call the doctor for some more reassurance. I scheduled blood work for tomorrow and an MRI on May 12th to confirm whether or not I have PSC. I am under the impression that while this is a chronic illness, it is treatable, which is what the doctor was sure to tell my mom. 

I can't stop thinking about it. I am quite the heavy drinker and have dealt with substance abuse disorder for many years now, so I wonder if it could simply be abnormal liver function from the alcohol. If so, I am more than willing to make that change and cut back. 

A little background about myself, and things I tell myself for reassurance: 

- I have no history of IBD, UC or Chron's. I simply had gallstones. 

- I am of female sex, which while possible I heard is more rare than it is with male. 

- 22 years old, not sure if age has a factor with PSC sufferers. 

- When I had my gallbladder removed, there was significant scar tissue around the organ that makes me worry I may have scarring to my bile ducts as well. With that being said, I wonder if the scarring to my gallbladder could be one of the reasons (other than my liver function) they are worried I may have PSC. 

- Other than mental health problems and issues with addiction, I would say I'm generally a healthy 22 year old. I am obese, but have steadily and healthily losing weight to the best of my ability. 

I think the idea of dealing with a chronic disease such as this is so hard to wrap my head around. I also tend to be somewhat of a pessimist on account of my anxiety and depression, so the thought processes I've been having are not fun. 

Just looking for some reassurance or advice from those who have gone through this, as there's only so much the doctor can tell me until we get those tests done. Based on estimated guesses, how likely do you think it is that this could be PSC? And what should I do to come to terms with having it if I am diagnosed?

For years I have struggled with gastro issues. It started with GERD, advanced to diverticulitis, and ended with an IBS-C diagnosis. I experienced a slew of diverticulitis attacks, which resulted in a sigmoidectomy a year ago. During all that, I was also taking Linzess daily for IBS-C. For years I have had IBD tossed around as a possibility, but never officially diagnosed. 

After my colectomy a year ago, I thought I was cured! For 9 months I felt great. But then my symptoms started again. Weight gain, acid reflux, extreme gas, diarrhea, rashes, constipation, low fever, and generally feeling like crap. I’ve had incredibly thin stools throughout the day and have felt internally inflamed for a couple months. 

This week I started feeling really bad. Really bloated, thin stool, and no bowel sounds. Completely lost my appetite and did a liquid diet all week.

My GI sent me for bloodwork which showed very high CRP and lymphocytes. My stool sample (first I have ever had) came back positive for lactoferrin. CT today showed inflammation. GI is sending me for a colonoscopy (my 8th) on Tuesday. 

I feel like I have been on such a long journey with this, and I really just want answers. I feel like my life currently revolves around the bathroom and battling symptoms. From what my GI said and my understanding of lactoferrin, IBD is the most likely possibility.

About a month ago, I started having blood & white mucus in my stool. This has continued until now. Otherwise, I feel fine. I haven't lost weight, no diarhea at all, no increased frequency of bowel movements. Just some discomfort (not pain) after I poop but that goes away quickly. I feel full of energy - except for when I'm excessively worrying about this. 

I did a stool test and they found my calprotectin level was 1050. I have had blood tests and another stool sample and am waiting for results. My doctor is worried that it could be an IBD, but at the same time is baffled by my lack of symptoms - given the apparent severity of inflammation indicated by the calprotectin. She suggested it could be a false positive but I'm typically very pessimistic so I've been preparing for the worst.

I have never had this before. I do get bouts of IBS - post-prandial diarhea (only after eating too much). But I haven't had a flare up since before Christmas.

come back (the next day the 3rd) they finally called the gastro doctor and i was admitted and they said they were going to perform a colonoscopy and one down my throat (idk the name) results come back and they said that i just had minor ulcers through my body. they put me on toradol which finally gets my pain to be a 3/10.

I’m 29 years old, AFAB. i’ve been having symptoms for years now (about four), including acid reflux, stomach cramps, diarrhea, blood on toilet paper, occasionally blood in my stool and more. i put off seeking treatment for years because, honestly i was scared and because it all seemed like maybe it would go away. 

and of course, it hasn’t. I finally saw a GI specialist last month and got recommended for a lot of blood work, an x-ray of my colon with barium and an endoscopy. due to my blood results which indicated both a high ESR and high CRP (1.8/ml?) my doctor recommended me for a colonoscopy too. 

Basically, they were going to book me for January but because my doc called and pulled some strings I’ll have it in August with my endocoscopy. To say I’m freaking out would be an understatement. 

as a person with a female body, i’ve always been sort of ignored by doctors when voicing my health concerns and i have ignored them myself. It’s all happening really fast and I’m still having really bad symptoms at the same time. It’s terrifying. It’s humiliating. I feel like I’m being betrayed by my body in the most humbling way possible. I didn’t expect all these things i’ve been dealing with to ACTUALLY be real and to not be simply IBS but something really inflammatory, something that could change the way I live my life. 

Has anyone else gone through this whirlwind of emotions? Do you guys have any advice for dealing with all of this? My x-ray is Monday and while I’m nervous, I’m also hopeful. I’m so scared of the big ‘c’ word (cancer) but crohn’s is just as scary.",2022-05-08 00:25:42

She’s 30f, non smoker, non drinker, eats healthy, not overweight, and in general a healthy happy person. 

Last year or so she started having upper stomach pains and her doc scheduled an endoscopy. Turns out she has GERD and a hatial hernia. We adjusted our diets and made lifestyle changes to help - which had been successful. 

Fast forward to February 2022 - she starts getting frequent diarrhea. Frequent as in sometimes 5-6x per day and no real stopping of it unless she takes Imodium. It’s usually urgent but she does not usually have any associated stomach pain. Thought at first it was a bug, but after one week she called her GI. They said to stay hydrated and take Imodium as needed…

After two weeks straight of this she called back and they had her come in for labs - blood and stool. Results:

Calprotectin, Stool
160 ug/g
Standard Range
<=49 ug/g

C Reactive Protein
25.2 mg/L
Standard Range
0.0 - 6.0 mg/L

They suggested a colonoscopy to which she had last week. Results from that are that she has inflammation-ileitis. 

They haven’t given any follow up on what can be done or what this means. But I think it means she may have IBD? She hasn’t had a normal BM since February. And her mental health has tanked rightfully so. 

We scheduled a second opinion but there must be something we can do?

She’s worried it’s something like cancer, I’ve been trying to comfort her but neither of us have medical backgrounds and just want some guidance. 

Thanks for reading this if you’ve stuck with me. Just want to help get her feeling better.",2022-05-08 21:09:06

I have had an anal fissure since about September.

I have now had 2 MRIs and 1 MRE and they want to do one more MRE. The MRIs didn’t show any fistula or abscess as was suspected by my surgeon and so now she says she thinks since that’s the case it probably isn’t caused by my Crohn’s. I’m on Stelara but I still have soft stools and mucus. My butt is always itchy because of the mucus and it’s so uncomfortable. I’m supposed to be having surgery for it soon but I don’t see how it couldn’t be caused by Crohn’s. I think it at least started because of my disease but it might not be healing because the area is constantly moist. I have this lidocaine cream she gave me but that shit doesn’t work, just makes my butt more itchy. I guess I’m just asking for other’s experiences especially those who have had a fissure and skin tag removed and Botox injected.",2022-05-08 02:56:18

I've already been on both budesonide and mesalamine.

The budesonide produced some worrisome side effects about four months into a seven-month course, and I'm a bit concerned about taking in immunosuppressant like Imuran.  Primarily I worry about the potential for infection.  

I'm double-vaxxed and double-boosted for COVID, and plan to spend as little time around others as possible (masked and social distancing, of course), but I have some extensive - and filthy - work that I will be doing on my house over the Summer (and it can neither be postponed nor can I afford to hire someone else to do it).  It's work that I've had to do over the past two Summers, and involves exposure to mould, dirt and occasional animal droppings when I have to access my crawl space.  

I'll be using sharp tools, and I'm preternaturally clumsy; I know from experience that I'll have more than my share of cuts and scrapes by the time the work is done.  So all manner of opportunity to develop a nasty infection no matter how careful I try to be.

So, have any of you had issues with infections, slow wound healing or other issues while taking Imuran?  Did you have to make special arrangements for things like dental work or vaccinations (like flu shots) while you were on it?   If you have any advice or warnings for me, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Plus, if you have any heads up to offer around managing any other side effects, I'd be in your debt as well.  Thanks.",2022-05-09 05:44:01

I managed to get a colonoscopy done on Monday and the consultant confirmed that my bowels were heavily inflamed with colitis. Whilst in hospital I was able to give a stool and blood samples and I contacted the IBD nurse the next day who was able to looks at my test results and rule out c-diff (which I gather would have been treated with antibiotics). I was prescribed with prednisone starting at 40mg and tapering down over the course of 2 months which I started yesterday. 

Since then I have felt a little more human and my trips to the bathroom are less then they were. I was just wondering what other peoples experiences were like on these steroids? I’m due to get married in just over 2 weeks time and I’m really praying that I am near a state of remission by then.

heavy drinker and would get pressure under my rib
cage after huge bouts of drinking. I ended up
getting sober at 25 and though maybe it was my
liver getting enlarged. But very once in a while these
small full pains of pressure would happen and go
away after a few days or weeks would pass. Working
out and a good diet seemed to be the trick possibly.
Fast forward to the last couple of years I've been
experiencing more pain around my rib cage on both
sides and a lot of it had to do with an intense
amount of stress and anxiety I suppose. Eventually
it would go away. Sometimes I'd even have
constipation when under alot of stress. But would
go away eventually.
3 weeks ago today, I ate some really bad food
seemingly from a fast food restaurant and got really
bad diarrhea and bloating with cramping. Usually I
go to the bathroom and it goes away. This time it
has not, it's been 3 weeks 24/7 or bloating and
discomfort now on my lower abdomen and around
my rib cage and it's been driving me nuts.
Last week I got so freaked out I had some sort of
cancer (I can be sort of a hypochondriac) because
the pain would never go away, I went to the ER last week and
they did a CT scan and said everything looked fine
except mild colitis and enteritis is suspected. At
least no cancer? They left me with antibiotics and a

I've had ibs since i was 14 my life was pretty fked up yk how it feels to have ibs in school i lost so many friends bcuz of it, my point is that my parents keeps calling me lazy without understanding how hard to live with this chronic disease 4 years when i was 16 my parents wanted me to get into a medical good college so they wont need to pay for it if i get great grades then they wont have to pay just like they paid for my other siblings who failed to get in it. they made me take classes before last year which means i had to go to school for 11th grade and take lessons with 12th grades imagine having ibs and going out for like 12 hours i was also bullied in that time bcuz of ibs i was mentally and physically tired i pushed myself too much and ended up crying every night but waking up in the morning to continue my life. at that time i thought to myself if my ibs wont disappear then whats the point in studying college will be more like a hell to me! i convinced my parents to take me to the doctors while they kept on saying yk there's no cure and you have to live with it.... i had 3 colonoscopy from 3 diff doctors and they all gave me useless medicine i got kinda depressed knowing i wont be able to get my normal life back. i became depressed and i didn't had any friend at that time even the ones i knew starts to ignore me so i left them be i started getting bad grades and didn't care about or thought about anything in that time it felt like i used all my energy the year before and it all doesn't matter anymore. i failed in that year even tho i wanted to success but i couldn't whats the use of success if i cant even work. ibs ruined my life, my parents became more strict at that time my siblings shamed me for failing and talked about how their grades used to be back then. i remember at that year i literally kept crying everyday for 4 months at least. what hurts no matter how much i try to explain to them about ibs they just say yeah but everyone has it. why you gotta over react? those people who made it are they better than you? we gave you everything and all we ask from you is to study... it was literally so hard for me, to not having a person there for me or understands me i felt like the whole world was against me then after that i took another year i studied a lot i kept on pushing so i can make it to the college they want me to get in... and i actually i did it, i made it even tho noun of my siblings did! i continued a year cuz it was covid so i pass a year in college i was honestly so relived then this year they announce that we should take a 3 days and i went for a few days but couldn't continue cuz my i had to go to the bathroom every 5 mins and also i saw people from old school so i couldn't take it.. the bullying and the trauma they'll tell everyone about me. and the worst part its not like im cured its still happening and i swear if i was cured i wouldn't give a damn about the old people in my school but the problem my suffering is still here. i cant eat anything cuz it will trigger my stomach and even if i didn't eat my stomach would still be upset so i asked my parents that i want to take a gap year cuz fr if i kept on pushing myself and only listening to what my parents tells me imma go insane like i was back then tw: i used to cut my thighs so i can feel smth cuz everything seemed so unreal back then its like i was meant to suffer i cried so much that my vision got bad rn and i literally stayed awake for almost months slept only for 3 hours a day. so i couldn't make myself worse i needed that gap year and i took it no matter how much they tried to convince me that I'm making a wrong decision but i knew myself better and they wouldn't care less as long I'm successful so finally i started to care about myself this year and its been kinda good for healing. on the other hand my brother is failing hes been in med school since 6 years and keeps failing and my parents keeps on paying for him until this day trying to convince him to study they keep on comparing me to him. it makes me so mad like all what you out me thru and i actually made it into a college where u wont need to pay for it!! and my siblings all of them didn't make it as much as i did they weren't ill!! and they hadn't a fking disease that mess up their life, they had friends who supported them i wish i had only one person at least to comfort me at that time and tells me i did my best and they're proud of me!! but i got no one in that time, do you realize how hard its for me to stay alive while i got no purpose here? i gave my parents and they still not proud keeps on making me feel like a failure. its not like i don't want to be successful, i really want it so bad i actually wish i had any of their normal life. do you think i want to stay in house with no friends and no job? its funny cuz my mom literally said to me ""you're lazy, you've always been ur whole life so its not the ibs not ur suffering with this chronic disease its literally just you being lazy, i know you ur whole life you've always wanted to just have fun and never go to school"" lol next 2 weeks after she said that i spent a whole month in the hospital bcuz of the pain. and until today i actually wanted to heal and stay away from anything that ruin my mood but my anger issues couldn't take it, when my lovely sister who should be supportive and understands me said ""you too will become like ur brother who failed. whats the diff between u and him? see how i made our parents proud"" she says it IN front of my parents with a smile... she's literally shaming me for smth i have no control over, i told her that i don't want to hear her say that ever again and said ""are y'all stupid or act like it? how many times do u want me to explain this to u? i don't want to hear you say that ever again"" then they took her side and I'm the bad guy rn for not controlling my anger.. man I'm sick of it. they'll never realize how much i tried to make them proud and its never enough. and it hurts that they all got an easy life they could've done classes and jobs easier!!! so why are they comparing me? and idk whats wrong with my siblings they say they wanna help me but it seems all they do is talking about how they're good at their jobs and how easily they passed college and I'm a failure who isn't like them. i wanna kms tf i even hate god if there's one cuz its not fair. why am i the only one who have to go thru this? i literally believe that everyone hates me. i think ill be alright in the morning but yeah i just wanted to vent and ik no one would understand having ibs except this place. pls tell me i am not overreacting cuz this shit is tiring and im sick of it... and if u relate pls let me know i want to know im not alone in this.",2022-05-15 00:55:46

3107,Is this IBD?,Kitteh2001,0,uperby,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/uperby/is_this_ibd/,7," 

Hello,

My story is really short and simple: 21 years old, never had any GI problems before. Aproximately 1 year ago, i have started taking a drug called Accutane ( for acne, for about 7 months, under the supervision of a dermatologist). Now, 6 months have passed since i have stopped my treatment. I have stopped it because i have started to get pain in the right location of the belly button ( ache pain, pressure; it is not the sensation you get when you have foodpoisoning, when your entire stomach hurts; for me, it is just that intestine there, in the right of the belly button, that hurts and moves a lot, i think its spasm; now, whenever i take to take a pill of any form, i get that pain; also after eating anything i get that pain). Apart from that pain, i get lots, lots of GAS ( which i did not have like a month and a half ago). Literally, i wake up, my right side of the belly ( the instestine i suppose) aches, hurts me and i have lots of gas. Also, since the start of that Acuttane treatment, i have never had a normal poop, they are not diarrhea, they are a lil' bit hard, like a mixture of them ( not bad, not good).

I have visited 2 gastroenterologists, both of them said that is probably IBS, and i have done x-ray, VSH blood tests, and calprotectin fecals, all were good ( aproximately 3 months ago?; i had the same symptoms then, but not at a lower intesity).

Right now i am taking Trimebutine, but its doing nothing for me ( been taking it for a month and a bit).

Acuttane has been proven/said to cause in a small amount of individuals either IBS or IBD.

I am really depressed these days, as my acne is coming back ( the reason i took that stupid drug in the first place), and my health seems to be not good.

I was wondering if you people have similar symptoms?",2022-05-14 12:51:58

I don’t know if I’m having IBD (at the extreme early stages) or I’m just thinking too much. It really bothers me and I’m afraid that my GI doctor is not doing sufficiently.

It started from having a resection surgery on Jan 3 to treat my SMAs - basically part of my duodenum is gone.

Since then I never felt the same. Had temporal delayed gastric emptying which went away in a month but what was left was bloating and waking up with phlegm in the morning (likely reflux during sleep), and weight loss.

It’s been an up-and-down journey for me throughout this process.

[9th Mar] Stool test: Calprotectin > 1000. Negative on stool PCR test for most viral/bacterial/parasites.

[19th Mar]: Prescribed Augumentin and Flagyl in hopes it’s an unknown bacterial infection.

[30th Mar]: Blood test: Ferritin (normal), Vitamin B (normal), Folic acid (normal), Iron (normal), TIBC (normal), T4 free (normal), TSH (normal), Celiac (negative), WBC (normal), ESR auto levels (24 high - normal is 0-19).

[31st Mar]: Stool test. Calprotectin 216.

[5th Apr]: Endoscopy and Colonoscopy. Found 2 small ulcers at terminal ileum and inflammation. Biopsy had chronic and acute inflammation (Negative for IBD and in favor of infectious origin).

For 7 days I felt better and as if almost normal.

[11th Apr]: Booster vaccine 

Going forward since then, after eating lots of spicy, dairy and bread, and close contact with covid case, I had fatigue, muscle aches and horrible bloating but negative for covid.

Bloating subsided and aches got better over time but am probably relying on digestive enzymes and felt body isn’t digesting things well.

[13th May]: Stool test. Calprotectin 136.

I started having cramps feeling before pooping and sometimes pains (not sure if cramps) on the lower left abdominal area. My stomach gets bloated too even without food.

Can calprotectin fluctuate every now and then?",2022-05-15 08:55:24

**COLONOSCOPY**: DESCENDING COLON BIOPSY: colonic mucosa with focal crypt architectural distortion and focal paneth cell metaplasia

There is focal neutrophilic cryptitis and neutrophilic inflammation extending into the surface epithelium in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. In addition, there is an area of focal crypt architectural distortion with a single area of Paneth cell metaplasia in the descending colon. The findings are non-specific and can be seen in patients with infection, focally active IBD, injury due to mucosal prolapse/trauma, or possible medication/drug injury. Of note, the presence of crypt architectural distortion and focal Paneth cell metaplasia is usually seen in patients with chronic/prior mucosal injury; however, the differential diagnosis still includes the above listed conditions. There is no evidence of dysplasia, granulomas, or viral inclusions.

M32, UC patient, 1 yr in remission on mesalamine. No any symptoms with stool and stomatch.

10  days ago I got 1 canker sore on my lip, then 3 in my inside-lip and  then 15 of them all over my mouth. They are constantly growing, pain as  hell and I cannot talk, eat or drink. I am also having fever. They even  caused angina in my throat so ENT put me on pencilin now.

Not  sure how to threat this, but my life is destroyed, feel like  I want to  die. It hurts much more then when I had my UC flare, then at least I  could eat and did not had a fever.

Does anyone have experience with this, can it be co-related to UC, and does anyone have some advice?

I just completed this FMT study in Minneapolis and figured some of you may be interested. I completed the UC one (as that's that I have) but I've linked the Crohn's one as well. 

For the UC one, you take 2 FMT or placebo tablets daily and have a check-in with a stool sample every 2 weeks. The entirety of the study lasts 8 weeks but you have the option to do it again, but this time for sure getting the FMT tablets regardless of what you received in the first round. There's minimal compensation (I got a couple of gift cards) but my poops genuinely felt better with this. So maybe yours will too!

I made a doctors appointment but in Canada doctors are still doing phone sessions. I told him my symptoms and he thought maybe internal hemorrhoid or a fissure and made a referral to a GI.  Since then the symptoms have been getting worse. There is much more blood with my stool mixed with mucus. And I’m experiencing minor abdominal pain from time to time. Also sometime I get the urge to go to the bathroom and it’s just gas with mucus and blood. My appointment with the GI is on June 2nd but once again it’s only a phone session…. I’m starting to worry thinking about the worse but I’m also convinced it could be IBD. Is there any suggestions on how to stop the bleeding ?,2022-05-21 00:01:16

To start I am a COTA/L and Director of Rehabilitation for a SNF. Last year, last spring or early summer, is when I got my first briefing about monkey pox. Since this virus has made its landing in the US questions have arrived of course. 

For civilians yes there’s a US case, so far risk of out break is low, yes there is a vaccine. 

For those of us that work in direct patient care. Have y’all read about the virus and the vaccine yet? It is the first live nonreplicating vaccine which I found to be interesting. ( before I went back to school for OTA, I studied at Univ of Southern Miss for Microbiology and worked as a research tech in one of the virology labs). Since the main course of tx for IBD tends to be biologics majority of us cannot take live viruses. Now I ask the question is nonreplicating vaccines a game changer for us. 🧐 from the reading done so far the monkey pox vaccine is live but non replicating and is made of a virus that is similar to monkey pox and small pox. It is part of the national stockpile in the US, and is only available for the high risk. As we saw in healthcare during covid, big enough outbreak means we are the high risk whether we want to be vaxxed or not. So doctors, nurses, auxiliary professionals, and allied health members, if you’re direct patient care thoughts ? Y’all are welcome to DM me as well as this kind of post can be reactive.",2022-05-21 17:17:17

I recently had a nasal infection and was prescribed antibiotics and within the first two days of taking them it kicked in a major flair up I tried treating it with mezavant However after taking it for three weeks symptoms just seem to be getting worse ended up going to a local clinic to get prescribed steroids which I took for a week and it fully calm down like after the second day I had no mucus farts and I was able to go to to the bathroom like normal. shortly after I ended up getting mild constipation and a few pimples all over my chest and face. Probably due to the steroids. 
And then two weeks after that the flareups fully came back I’m kind of at my wits end because I eat healthy I take probiotics and a whole bunch of other random supplements that in theory are meant to help with Gut health like L-gutimine 

Also I do have a Doctor Who I go for my Gastro issues But she basically says that if the mezavant  doesn’t work That I’ll end up having to get surgery which I find odd that in Canada there’s only one medication to treat IBS and IBD
I’m just wondering if there’s anyone else who’s found other ways to keep their symptoms in check I should also say that my ibd tends to flares up very Mildly just before I get my period but it never results in mucus farts Like over the past week I don’t think I’ve actually pooped once I’ve just been doing bloody mucus farts",2022-05-23 21:47:39

Once the scan was done it showed that I have pancolitis. Now I've had a colonscopy before a few years ago with similar symptoms (minus the cramping) and it came back clean. So now I need to go for another colonscopy to see which IBD I have. Dr thinks it's either Crohns or Ulcerative Colitis.  I started taking meds if it is Crohns and T3 for the pain but the T3 don't last long. Worse part is I just started a new job Thursday and had to call in Friday because I was in so much pain.

Tests they did came back normal despite feeling as if a switch was flipped and i was a totally different person.   


Afterwards, i had the following:  
a persistently high heart rate even while relaxed that would jump quite high with little exertion (since improved overall with meds)  


palpatations in waves and pounding heart that would keep me awake at night sometimes,   
bowel habits changed with some other oddities - (went from going once or twice to at least 3-5 times per day, and the worst of it where i had 11 bms once in March -- all with varying textures and consistency ranging from watery diarrhea weekly for no discernable reason to me, to solid ribbon shapes that look mostly normal, to solid with yellow crap falling off of it rarely, seeing sometimes a dark almost mucus like stuff on solid bms sometimes, weekly passing mucus only or so, and rarely and on a couple occasions passing food i ate less than 6 hours ago - literally seeing lettuce barely digested as well as apples and carrots before the next meal. Still going 3-5 times per day, usually solid and normal but with occasional diarrhea and yellowish crap today alongside solid bms.) I've since made some diet changes that helped with diarrhea mostly but still largely the same overall.  


Once or twice a week generally will get rectal discharge with no warning.  


Prior soft anxiety that got orders of magnitudes worse after with no triggering event. (Has gotten signifcantly better; am taking meds to help with that and therapy. Still having panic attacks fairly often)  


Rapid weight loss and fluctuations despite eating as much if not more than before -- was 208-212 for over a year that didn't change at all despite efforts being made to try (Total of 18-22 pounds lost, most very quickly with periods of no weight loss, then gaining back some weight, then losing it again and ending up a bit lower than i was previously. I've since gained back 10 pounds, but I am losing it again it looks like).   


Fatigue -- consistent pattern of every other day i get a day or two of fatigue despite good sleep. This hsan't changed.   


Random episodes of joint pains that come and go as of April. I've had joint pains before, but these are new and in places i never had them and with no apparent cause. Usually it was just my right wrist but only while working, now i get random episodes of pain mostly in my right foot and knee.   


Regular cramping in the abdomen. The cramps are usually mild to high-mild but occur at random throughout the day with occasional days where it's so mild i barely notice or even nothing at all, but early on they were a fair bit worse sort of like a rough stomach ache. They are usually in my RLQ, but it feels like sometimes it moves higher up to just below my ribs and a bit close to the bottom of the sternum and rarely on my Left upper quadrant, but 90% of my cramps is RLQ.  


Sensation of gas or liquid in my RLQ almost everyday since Feb. Just annoying mostly, but early on i could feel it when i would move around or rotate and there would be some pain there.   


Despite all of my symptoms, every test I've been given so far has come back normal. From thyroid to calproc, celiac tests, allergy tests It's all come back normal so far.   


I met with my gastroenterologist and he said my symptoms sound like Crohn's disease and he would be curious to know what specifically is happening on my right side so now i am waiting for dates on endoscopy and colonoscopy.  


If those come back normal, then idk what there is left to do.",2022-05-23 04:24:11

It’s all great that these are clear from these results but how does it work when you get a diagnosis of colitis from the colonoscopy but then the results from the biopsy says “Normal Biopsy” the only thing that was noted in the colonoscopy was patchy mild erythema in the rectum which was labelled “prep related” and single aphthous ulcer in the TI which was also biopsied and came back normal. 

At present I have food intolerances.. had a cal protectin of 373 back in feb… but that wasn’t noticed when I did a stool test a couple of months later… have joint pain, eye issues, certain foods like raw vegetables and meat irritate my gut.. no diarrhoea but more constipation, have bubbling aches mostly on my left side of my which is more noticeable at night.. specially after eating hard to digest foods.

I have had very minor bleeding (bright red) with every bowel movement for about 2 months. Calprotectin was 1050 and then a week later 435. No diarrhea or discomfort. No weight loss or loss of appetite. Suspected IBD.

They scheduled a colonoscopy but found no evidence of an IBD - in fact said my colon was very healthy. However, at the rectum (I think as I remember) they found 2cm of distal lymphoid tissue. They've taken biopsies.

What is that? Will it heal? What do you think of these results.

Side note: the colonoscopy was insanely painful and it seemed like the sedative didn't work (100mcg fentanyl, 10mg buscopan, 4mg midazolam). I was in tears. The doctor kept going though and told me I have a hyper mobile colon? Maybe due to having IBS.

3180,Thoughts from the community?,fama002,0,v0fk3v,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/v0fk3v/thoughts_from_the_community/,2,"Hello all, 28M hispanic. Starting on May 1st I developed diarrhea that came suddenly. It started out very so often through out the day but by the end of the week it was essentially every time after I ate. On May 8th I tested positive for Covid and got fevers and sore throat which lasted about 3 days, but fatigued and diarrhea continued. On May 17th I went to the doctor and was given digestive enzymes due to my stool being off and on from diarrhea , and the times it was somewhat solid it was greasy, light brown looking, easily broken down with the flush of toilet. On May 24th I started taking flagyl prescribed by a doctor , mind you I only have had blood work done and it all came out normal except for bilirubin slightly elevated. I’m now on day 6 of flagyl and the diarrhea stopped a while ago but I have cramps that come and go after I eat, and also I only have 1 bowel movement per day now, which is usually in the morning … strangest thing is it feels like I’m completely emptying everything out from the day prior. In between all of this time I have lost 11lbs as well and am struggling to gain or maintain weight … although caloric intake has been low. To recap and give more details:

- diarrhea starts
- test positive for Covid
- diarrhea continues but develop nausea 
-have to force my self to eat 
- go on flagyl, start feeling better
- one bowel movement per day now, feels like everything is emptied from day prior 
- struggling to put on or maintain weight 
- knees hurt almost everyday , mildly

I have been most healthy my entire life and actually a good amount of muscle mass prior to this. I never had severe stomach pains although cramps did develop at some point. I have another doc app on June 1st in which I will tell my doc to order a stool test. Thoughts from anyone? By the way I cut out dairy and gluten for 2 weeks and was eating extremely healthy and light … at this point I’ve re introduced them to my diet as I saw no change.",2022-05-29 19:05:29

I specifically remember asking multiple times when to take the next dose and how many. The nurse said to take both injections in 2 weeks time and that after that, they would be delivered to my door. I'm meant to have 1 dose tomorrow but I have no more injections, as I used them both about 2 weeks ago and none have since been delivered. I phoned the IBD helpline to ask if I would have to go collect them or if they are coming soon and they said they would get back to me.

They got back today (I missed the call unfortunately, it was a voicemail) and the nurse said that I should have enough to last me until June 17th when I see her. But I also have a slip saying the 14th of June and a letter saying the 17th is just a phone appointment, not in person.

I'm really nervous about this because this means I will have missed 2 single doses by the 17th of June. I'm really nervous I've done it wrong and my Mum has asked me if I was correct in taking 2 that day, and I'm sure I was right but now I'm not anymore. I'm going to phone tomorrow but I'm nervous what they will say about me having taken 2 lots 2 weeks ago. Or am I meant to simply wait?

For further info, this is for ulcerative colitis. If you need anymore info please ask. I'm really lost on where I went wrong and I think they are helping a bit.

Edit: How long can I go without taking it to taking it again? Also, the phone appointment is apparently on the 16th not the 17th, so now I'm extra confused.

Edit 2: I'm based in UK for anyone wondering. I heard back. I go in on the 14th to review how adalimumab is helping. Have a phone appointment on the 16th for probably similar reasons? Nothing about receiving some adalimumab, unfortunately. I think I just have to forgo this one dose and hope it doesn't affect me too much. Hoping they give me a dose on the 14th, as I would be meant to have one then. And also sort out deliveries so this doesn't happen again.",2022-05-30 23:09:43

My GI doc started me on Mesalamine then after a month of that add a steroid. After a few weeks of that and a stool stamp took me off the steroid. I've had zero improvement. 
Still taking Mesalamine the only thing my GI doc wanted to try was to give me something to stop my diarrhea. Waiting for the follow up appointment to say that didn't work either. 
I'm not sure if this is related at all but the third day after stopping the steroid and starting the anti-diarrhea meds I got extremely sick. Spiked a fever and lost all appetite (still had Neverending poops and cramps). Now that my fever broke, my stomach hurts and I have mouth sores. I'm just tired of being sick and having to fight my doctor to understand how sick I am as ""all your tests are negative and you only had mild inflammation...""

 Can steroids and immunosuppressants help get into remission without having the need of being on biologics . Because not every country have insurance and not everyone have the money for it tbh . (Talking from a third world country)

Because in that  sub everyone seems to be either one step away from having a surgery or have severe complications and swears that remission is impossible ,or they are either using biologics . I saw no single success story on less costly drugs that have worked on anyone with Crohn's .

I have quiet a story to share and everyone involving my friends and family and even doctors are tired of hearing it so I am just gonna pour it all out over here. You don't have to read it all you can simply answer the question in the TLDR section and I would be grateful for it. 

It started a month ago when I ""thought"" (I still don't know for sure) that I have swallowed a staple pin. 
Foolish I know. I had just stapled a packet of snack and tore it open possibly the pins fell inside and I spit one of them out when I felt it in my mouth. I became very stressed that what would happen to me now. 
I had to leave immediately on a trip afterwards so I did  but I immediately started having severe stomach pain after 1 hour. It continued even after I had sudden bowel movements two times (stool was all yellow in color and very acidic) . So that's how it started. 
I continued to had stomach pain throughout the week generally getting worse when I eat something. Went to toilet as many as 4-5 times a day. 

It's worth noting due to my personal and professional life I was also under a lot of stress on top of the Illness so as severe as it seemed to me I had other things to worried about. 

Reached home finally after 2 week of on and off stomach pain the diarrhea had subsided after 10 days and I was going close to 3 times a day now with mostly normal poop. Took antacids for a while they helped a little not much. 

Finally went to a doctor did an endoscopy done although I didn't wanna be sedated so it was one of the most horrible experience of my life. Doctor said visually everything is normal but he just wanted to take a biopsy anyway. I couldn't tolerate it and said no. 

Since there was nothing else he  diagnosed me with IBS gave me some antispasmodic tablets and antacids. For a time I was getting better. Had mild to no stomach pain most of the time and even bowel moments were stable at 2 times per day (all normal) . 

But again something stressful came up in my professional life had to change cities and then it was a downward spiral. Felt so sick in the flight had severe chest pain thought I was having a heart attack. 
Did 2D echo heart test and an ECG all normal. 

New Doc there told me it must be GERD and gave me medicine for that. Started taking the medicine but each day I was feeling weaker and weaker with lots of gas , bloating, frequent bowel movements and all of them. 
5 days in and I had to return home. 
I also found out I was having terribly low vitamin B12 (63) 
Got a shot for it and had a very bad reaction to it. Half my body (arm, leg and face) had a warmth, tingling sensation under my skin ans felt numb (through I never lost control of movability) thought I was having a stroke. Somehow got through the night but ever since that day I feel my left half is weaker than my right half. 

Decided to went to the capital, was so weak and exhausted I fainted in the metro. Fortunately didn't had an injuries. 

The Gastroenterologist then gave me some test and here is what I found out. 

My iron is border line Ok
My vitamin b12 and D both are low 
My ESR is 22 (for reference 15 or less is normal for age) 
My hs-CRP level is also elevated at 3.80 ( <3 is normal) 
I had lost 11 kgs in a month

He again gave me some PPIs, antispasmodics,some antibiotics and vitamin B12 tablets instead of injection (he couldn't explain the bad reaction) . 

This entire time my head felt under pressure, always felt sleepy and drowsy, had some times when I felt like I would faint again , my left half always seemed weaker than the right, had on average 3 bowel movements per day with mostly hard normal stool but occasional yellow semi solid ones too. 

I thought I was on track to recovery for the past week 
Didn't had any stomach pain at all, stools were normal, feeling more energy in the body. 

But now it the stomach pain is slowly starting to come back fluctuating between mild to moderate at times , bowel movements has increased to 4 times a day now , can't sleep at all since 2 days. 

What should I do guys? Also have some eyes irritation where it feels like burning mildly but I have had dry eye syndrome (I can't cry ) most of my life so it could also be that.

I told my doctor about it and he said it’s probably just regular constipation and prescribed me a laxative but i’m scared to take it because if it is a flare then i don’t want it to become liquid because then i’ll be going to the restroom 5-6 times a day instead of 2-3. what should i do?,2022-06-06 03:34:15

But on the way home the red lights was taking to long and I was sweating from the abdominal cramps. 

I walk in the house go poo felt alittle better took a shower then had like 3 bites out of some fries and chicken nuggets and THEN I felt my belly go BoomDaBaBoom 💥 and I started running for the toilet soon as I opened the door I shit myself (it was diarrhea) lucky I have my period right now and had a maxipad on.

But the question is why the hell am’i having contractions after this CT scan I feel like I’m about to give birth to a 9pound baby, I’m a mom and I honestly can’t tell the difference between labor pains and the cramps I’m having from contrast right now.

I only read the report now when i noticed it in my patient portal while viewing other results. Ive not had any bowel issues in the time since this report.)

I had a colonoscopy for blood in stool and loose stool. At the time I was experiencing those things, I was under an immense amount of stress caused by health anxiety for 5 months. I also had been on two different antibiotics in that timeframe (lung infection). Prior to those stressful months, I'd had no issues with my bowels. After the colonoscopy, my bowel issues very quickly cleared up and I've had no more issues. Which is why I was surprised when I finally looked at the pathology report I read this. 

Final Pathologic Diagnosis: 
1. sigmoid colon, polyp, endoscopic biopsy: 
Benign polypoid colonic mucosa, negative for adenomatous change. 
2. random colon, biopsies: 
Benign colonic mucosa with focal nonspecific chronic colitis. 
Negative for adenomatous change. SE/jh

At the time they called me with results, it wasn't even mentioned to me that they found chronic colitis. Pretty much my entire adulthood I've had no issues with my gut up until those months I was extremely stressed out. Now I'm so confused and wondering if I have IBD despite not having experienced chronic symptoms of it. I put a call into my gastro but still haven't heard back from anyone. Needless to say my anxiety is set off again wondering about IBD and why it wasn't mentioned to me before I saw the pathology report. Any insight would be appreciated.",2022-06-07 01:29:11

Do people generally find that Budesonide is helpful for symptoms (chronic mucus-y diarrhea 6-8x/day, extremely painful almost daily bloating and gas pain, etc)

I know this is hard to answer and it's different for everyone. But I'm wondering if IBD actually causes mood swings in a more direct way - not indirectly by depression and anxiety?

I have lately, when my UC is active, experienced unexplainable anger and I have absolutely no patience with anything. The slightest thing can set me off into a raging mood. I have never in my life experienced anything like that before. It feels almost like a childhood tantrum.

Unfortunately the people around me and my dog are in the recieving end of this problem. It is starting to be a real problem for me. I have been seeing a therapist but basically all they say it's that I'm stressed/depressed and med to work on mindfulness and meditation. But I don't feel depressed or stressed.

I received almost 260 responses, and while nothing I uncovered was groundbreaking, I am hoping it can be used by both patients and providers to understand how to approach the many different kinds of treatments for IBD.

I have attached a slightly edited version of the overall presentation.  And I have also created another presentation, just for you, Reddit. :)

* [Main presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1saTMIjODaotSIOb3UWAKElkK2k6JI9HL/edit#slide=id.p1)
* [Addendum for Reddit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OoWiwJwbGgHNd9vzguqff-92FgZbXUy6/edit#slide=id.p1)

The Main presentation goes through basically my whole research project, which has been condensed to the most important points.  This is what I presented on last fall.

The Addendum includes a closer look at the data, including graphs.  (I also have to apologize for the pie charts - they uploaded poorly to google drive and I am not sure how to fix it.)  I eventually want to dig into the bar graphs to compare how patients with different types of disease location and/or complications perceive different foods.  Unfortunately putting this data into a visually digestible format is incredibly time consuming, and I'm not sure when this will be done.

Thank you for all your participation and support!  And please let me know if you have any questions.

&#x200B;

In other news, my own GI doc approached me with a job offer, and I have officially accepted the position.  I will be joining South Denver Gastroenterology later this week :)

&#x200B;

Edit to add a TLDR:

* The perception of respondents is that medication is the most helpful treatment method, followed by surgery and then diet.  This is supported by current literature, and was statistically significant.
* Respondents trusted their provider most when recommending medication, then diet, and then surgery; and results were statistically significant.
* In comparing the perception of the effectiveness of diet, upper GI disease, small bowel disease, and large bowel disease were compared.  There were differences in the types of foods perceived as ""safe"" and ""dangerous"" for these groups (see the Addendum for tables).  However, differences between overall efficacy was not statistically significant.  This means that respondents of all disease types view overall diet the same way, but perceive that different foods have different ""safety profiles.""
* Future analysis of the data include descriptive statistics - basically comparing bar graphs of food safety profiles side by side, and further analysis of how patients who reported complications view the safety profile of foods.
* Recommendations from this study: I would love to see a baseline diet recommended to patients early in the diagnosis that is more catered toward their specific disease state.  Additionally, the old attitude of ""diet doesn't matter"" is outdated and dismissive towards patient perception, with approximately 1/3 of patients reporting that diet is very important in achieving and maintaining remission.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: I forgot to mention - if you are looking to explore a diet to help with your IBD, the [IBD Anti-Inflammatory Diet](https://www.umassmed.edu/nutrition/ibd/ibdaid/) (IBD-AID) was a diet that I found really catered to the complaints of IBD patients.  I tried it out while doing this study, but I've been in remission for a while now so I didn't notice too much of an effect on me personally.  It focuses on healing the gut microbiome, and is affiliated with a medical school.  Obviously it is a starting point and YMMV. :)",2022-06-14 17:27:15

Btw this is how my GP had told me to do it.  At that time my symptoms were loose stool floating 2,3 times a day normal for me is 1per day and there was also urgency. Did another fecal calp in early June but this time directly in a container so no contamination and the result is 102ug/g. Symtoms now are bowel frequency 1 per day and stool starts as type 4 but turns type 6 consistency that disintegrates in toilet. And I get pain on pressing abdomen specifically periumblical region, which lasts for 30 min after bm . 
I am trying to go to a gastroentrologist now to figure out what the hell is going on. 
My question is: which of my fecal calp is reliable ? Was the first one done incorrectly and might have shown more inflammation? Or has the inflammatiom actually increased even though bowel frequency is decreased?

I was diagnosed late last year after being admitted to hospital in a very severe way. I was so weak and passing so much blood (about 50 times a day for the month prior) that I was told that I was in a life-threatening position. I’d never had severe gastro issues before and my symptoms came on suddenly within a day. I’d only suffered a few months before becoming an emergency.

I have many other conditions, including severe connective tissue conditions and heart issues. I have been in a ‘severe’ flare for a year now. I talk/see a consultant every week and have done since diagnosis but still no further forward. Had to quit my job, my degree, etc. I’m 23 and feel like I’ve lost everything. I can only leave the house for short periods of time, with a carer that I can trust, with toilets nearby, etc. 

I’m sick of having accidents in public and during the night. The blood loss makes me ill. I throw up my medication constantly. I was on steroids for 9 months and nobody wants me to go back on them unless it becomes life-threatening again because of the risks involved. I’m so immunosuppressed from the medication that I am constantly ill with an infection. 

Biologics give me temporary blindness. Nobody can understand why. My consultants have worked tirelessly for an answer but have no idea. They’re worried that sticking with biologics will cause permanent blindness. Never had eye issues before, always had perfect vision.

I spent my childhood wheelchair bound and only recently managed to gain the strength to walk again, to then come down with IBD in a year. Feels like my life has been wasted to illness. I know I’m only young, but my friends my age all have moved out, have relationships, jobs, degrees, etc. I can’t move out because I need round the clock care (we are looking into the pathways to do this with government help etc, but it will likely be many years before help is put into place). 

Not really looking for medical advice, but all I see in support groups are people like “I just started meds a month ago and now have no symptoms, it DOES get better!” and these posts just hurt me more. I haven’t eaten a fruit or vegetable in a year man. 

Anyone been in a similar situation of complexity and found any sort of progress or anything that’s helped mentally or physically? Success stories just seem to get me down. I’m so jealous of people who have returned to mostly normal lives so quickly… I know that’s not everyone, but I feel so alone in this.",2022-06-19 17:12:50

But one day I got a horrible flare and I was angry, I took the decision to take a 4 day fast, will not eat anything for four days just salt water

After four days I had some yogurt and after 2-3 hours I took a safe  meal, For two-three days I took meals which suits me, and slowly I switched to foods which used to affect me a lot, but this time they didn't, I eat everything from super spicy foods to meat, fish, egg, alcohol  and everything else, but nothing happened, so I thought it just a remission one day I will back to where I was but it's been 5 months now I'm eating everything and nothing is happening

I noticed that I'm feeling super thirsty all the time but other than that everything is good, and I'm gaining weight too

Not sure if it's a solid remission or it's cured, But if flare ever comes back I know what to do

Not sure it will work for everyone and I don't recommend it,  a 4 day fast is dangerous, please don't do it without your doctor's Supervision.

Hi this is my first post to this thread. As I am writing this post I feel so hopeless that I am holding on from crying.

First things first I am a male in my early 20s. My problems started 2 years ago. Felt stomach pain, stomach burning, had endless burping after even drinking water, continuous bloating that made my belly feel heavy as hell and painful gas.

Went to a GI and had an endoscopy done. Results showed a mild gastritis no h.pylori, Gerd and a mild esophagitis. Doctor prescribed Nexium twice a day and a supplement once a day as a treatment.

First 2 months were great, my symptoms were 95% gone, the only one still going strong was the bloating.

After the 2 months mark though hell broke loose. All my symptoms came back and Nexium seemed to not do anything. Doctor said to continue my prescription and that it takes time to heal.

I did what he said but 5 months later 0 improvements. Quick note I did huge changes to my diet to help my situation(stop eating junk food, fried food, coffee, alcohol and many more things).

But the situation gets weider as 20 days ago I had a massive episode having non stop diarrhea for 5 days,nausea,pain in low abdomen and extremely burning sensation in stomach.

Called the doctor, we had blood work done and he said that probably I got a flu even though I told him that because I have university exams I haven't left the house for a week nor my gf that I live with had any symptom of a flue. He prescribed rifaximin to help my symptoms go away and as I was helpless and super tired I took the medication.

3-4 days after all my symptoms were gone.

But yesterday after 2 great weeks with no stool problem and reduced stomach problems, I got huge sharp pain in my stomach,belly and back. I couldn't even breathe for 1 hour.

Then it just stopped, didn't think much of it as I believed that my gastritis was acting up. But as the night approached I got severe pain in my belly and had diarrhea 5 times in a row. The bloating always there as the burning in the stomach and the severe pain in the abdomen. It seems impossible to be food poisoning or flu again.
 
Quick note, I had seen twice 3 years ago a tiny bit of blood in the toilet paper, didn't think much of it as I didn't have any bowel issues at that time and my skin is extremely sensitive in that area generally, so I thought that my skin was irritated from passing a large stool or something like that.

I have a million questions in my head. What causes my gastritis? Why isn't it going away? Why am I bloated 24/7? Why am I all of a sudden having diarrhea and nausea, painful gas and abdomen pain out of nowhere? Could this be ibd? Could this be ibs? Could this be sibo? Also scared to death that this could colon cancer as my mom died from it when I was 16. I booked an appointment with a new GI hoping to plan a colonoscopy soon but it will take 3 weeks just to see him.

I feel so depressed, my life is really a living hell the last 2 years. Do you guys have any suggestions on what could my problem be? Do my symptoms sound like ibd? Any suggestion/advice would be so welcome.",2022-06-19 10:37:59

Currently my GP is treating me. Was hoping to maybe hear some personal experiences similar? 
I have had chronic diarrhea for over 5 years now but I thought it was due to my Type 1 Diabetes and the weird way it can interact with your kidneys and bowels with water retention so o never looked into it as it wasn’t something having a great impact on my life. Aside from suffering hemorrhoids during pregnancy and then occasional constipation induced ones throughout the years, they’ve never been a big issues. About 4.5 weeks ago, I started getting really sharp rectal pain, swelling, and a burning/throbbing/sharp stabbing pain in my rectum. Some blood during the second week of symptoms. I couldn’t sit/sleep/driving is extremely difficult. I thought just hemorrhoids so I delayed going to the ER as my doctor suggested, thinking I had thromboses hemorrhoids (phone appointment only). I waited because I thought it was getting better. Then my menstrual cycle started and the diarrhea kicked up and everything got bad again but not as bad as before. Went to the ER on the 6th, they told me no hems, no fissure. CT to rule out abscess, none found. Had my colonoscopy on the 10th and the biopsy came back saying acute ileitis in the terminal ileum but the rectal biopsy was normal. Now, my swelling had went down substantially by that point but the pain is still so sharp. They threw words at me like proctitis, proctalgia fugax possibly. I called my doctor last week because I could barely sit for longer than a few minutes. She gave me prednisone (and antibiotics in case it’s a bacterial infection in the ileum) and omg it has helped so much pain wise. Starts hurting again just before the 24 hours is up. 
Basically long winded to ask if this has been the case for any of you. I have two autoimmune diseases already and I just idk. I guess I’m exhausted all the googling and wanted to ask people with personal experiences. I know you can’t diagnose me, but thought it worth a question.",2022-06-20 17:17:55

It doesn't happen every day, and it makes no difference if I take it with food (the food just ends up coming back up with it).  I'm not sure, but I think it may be interacting with other meds or supplements I'm taking - but so far I haven't identified a definitive pattern.

Has anyone here had this issue with azathioprine?  This morning it came back up a few hours after taking it, even though I had only consumed water during that time.  Dry heaving up medication is not my favourite way to start the day.

Have you noticed any interactions between the Imuran and other meds or supplements?  I think I may be actually getting some benefit from it - though it's hard to tell whether the lower stool frequency is due to the med or the fact that I'm not able to eat much in the first place.  But if it *is* working, I'd like to continue it.  Has anyone had their doctor provide either advice for this, or prescribed an antiemetic like phenergan to help them tolerate the med?

**EDIT:**  Thanks everyone who has commented - your contributions are a real help!  

I forgot to include one piece of information in my original post, and wondered if any of you have also had this experience:

On my 2-week blood work my ALT/SGOT was slightly elevated - which may have just been due to some strenuous yard work I was doing the day before and/or a bit of dehydration as a result.  I'm wondering if any of you had abnormal liver function tests come back around the time that you had issues with nausea - as that might be the main explanation for it (and a contraindication for taking Imuran in the first place).

If any of you have the time to indulge me this extra piece of info, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thanks!",2022-06-22 00:29:41

Still in the hospital, have made the decision to pursue surgical treatment.  Scheduled for Surgery #1 on Friday.  I can’t thank you all enough for the comments and conversation..

I poop normally now with no blood at all. It also really helps with my extreme hay fever, it's almost non-existent at this point. Though, I am scared of a couple of things side effects related. 

I care a lot about my looks and health and I heard a lot of people saying that they got a ""moon face"" which is something I was already scared of having. Is there anything I can do to prevent that from ever happening? 

I already workout everyday and I'm trying my best to eat responsibly as well. I'm also trying to stay hydrated. Yet I still have the fear of becoming fat and having a rounded face.

I've been reading a lot about it in this subreddit and it's making my anxiety worse.

So please, if anyone can tell me their experience with budesonide and how they dealt with it, that would be much appreciated.

The symptoms were so bad that I became deathly anemic, malnourished, and unable to even walk much. At this point, I was pooping blood up to 15 times a day.

Over the past year I’ve been on lots of prednisone, then 5 months of entyvio infusions. Despite all this I’ve continued to have symptoms, an insane amount of bleeding everyday multiple times this entire time. I also had an MRI confirming that there’s still active inflammation a few months ago, and even now my inflammation markers are high. But even at times when those markers were down, the bleeding never stopped. This is also despite the Mesalamine I take every single day. I’m now on enemas, and the early stage of Humira injections.

3326,Is this Ibd?,Kitteh2001,0,vlsxjj,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/vlsxjj/is_this_ibd/,3,"Hello!

About 8-9 months ago i have finished a 7 month treatment course with Accutane. During the treatment, i was having an extremely extremely mild ache ( in the evenings, after taking the medication) right side of my belly button. My dermatologist said that it is probably some intestine and i should not worry about it.

Well, now, after finishing the course, 9 months later, im having lots of digestive issues. Now,  i get the same ache after eating and especially a good couple of hours i have eaten, and it seems that after i get the gas out, it kinda fades away. Also, i get lots of gas after eating, which has never happened to me. Ever since taking this drug, i have never had a normal stool ( on the Bristol stool chart, it is mostly type 5, and sometimes type 6).  The intestine that is located right side of my belly button ( the one that aches) usually growls? ( especially when i lie down and before i sleep, i get a 30 minute - 1 hour of growling, intestines moving, gas; same thing in the morning, growling and gas, after i go to the bathroom, seems to be okay). I go to the bathroom just once a day, in the morning, but usually, right after i would eat, i would have the feeling of being able to go to the bathroom ( if i want), and be able to poop, this is right after i eat. Also, while eating, or right after eating my intestines moves a bit.  I can eat mostly anything, but lately i got diarrhea from stupid things, like peppermint tea, a donut ( i was having exams so probably the stress added).

**To sum up, my primary issues are: lots of gas; not having a normal stool; the right side belly button intestine ache and growl ( i have some other intestines that move as well a bit); i think im having ocasional stomach ache ( stomach pain - on scale it is probably 3-4/10).**

I have been to 2 doctors, gastroenterlogists: both of them made me do some calprotectin test ( to see whether there is an inflammation or not) and the results came back negative. They have put me try Trimebutine for like 2 months, no help at all. I have had like 2 months of probiotics, did not help at all.

This usually happens regardless of what i eat.

I posted about my worries here a few weeks ago when one of my liver enzymes came back borderline high in the face of nausea and occasional vomiting that I suspected might have been due to the hepatotoxicity of the medication.

Sure enough, my LFTs (AST/ALT/AlkPhos) all came back sky high, along with an elevated platelet count.  I haven't heard from the doc (who is usually quite prompt with these things - I'm going to assume that he's probably on holiday or something); but I stopped taking it today, and I feel almost like I'm being let out of prison:  no more nausea/vomiting and constant upset stomach, no more isolating, no more drinking caffeine water in the morning because coffee comes right back up (bringing the azathioprine along with it).

***However***, I'm also a little disappointed with this, as it seemed to be working - after a fashion.  I've gone from having as many as a dozen or more stools a day to one or two; and in the past few days they've actually been more or less **formed** \- for the first time in nearly two years!

This latest flare has been *awful*.  Eight months of budesonide last year resolved most of the pain and brought my calprotectin score straight down; but the frequent liquid stools (that had me all but confined to my house) had a significant impact on my quality of life.

I was actually planning to take a trip to a nearby town (90 minutes away, no rest stops anywhere along the route) a few weeks from now - something I haven't done for over a year.  Now I'm worried that I'll end up right back where I started before I began the azathioprine.

One thing that I’m a bit stuck on though is the fact that ever since that day (almost a month now) my BM’s have either been bright yellow themselves if I’m having type 6-7, or if they’re more formed then they’re brown but accompanied by a bright yellow fatty looking liquid. A few times I’ve sat on the toilet and just this yellow liquid has come out. It even stains the toilet yellow. 

I’ve brought this up to my GP many times and she just says “it means that food is passing through your gut too quickly” and moves on. My GI just kinda nodded and didn’t touch on it again, unfortunately my appts with her are quite short. 

I figured the moving too fast thing made sense as I am having very frequent loose BM’s, but I decided to test it. I ate corn a few nights ago, expecting it to come out within hours or at the very least the next day. I just had my first BM with corn… 4 days later. Which definitely isn’t fast?

When a 17 year old me went from having an upset stomach to suddenly pooping blood 7+ times a day within just a days time, I thought maybe I had food poisoning. Then maybe to stomach flu… then maybe a parasite. But urgent care test said otherwise. Starting senior year was an exciting thing for me. I had been online a year and a half prior. But never could I have imagined that it would turn out the way it did. I tried to play it off, I tried to push through. But I couldn’t stay awake in class. I was freezing cold in hot temperatures. I was dizzy and in so much pain. And I couldn’t eat if I wanted to make it through the school day. And even then I’d still have accidents as soon as I got into my car. But it would all be worth it after this weird stomach problem went away right ? Finally we got an appointment with a GI specialist. He listened to my symptoms, took an x-ray, told me I was just constipated and anxious, and sent me home with a prescription to take laxatives THREE times a day. This made me bleed out faster and I was going up to 15 times a day. This had already been going on for 2 months. At this point, I had just completely stopped going to school. My worried mom called back time a time again. We finally got a colonoscopy scheduled,but they refused to sign hospital homebound documents for me and told us that I needed to go back to school. We didn’t listen. Through just then next month, I lost 25 pounds. I couldn’t even hold down water, and was struggling to breath after just a few steps. The pain I was in was excruciating and I was uncontrollably pooping and vomiting. Doing colonoscopy prep like this was HELL. It was finally time for my colonoscopy and I needed to prove I wasn’t pregnant by peeing in a cup. I was so dehydrated, that I wasn’t even able to do so. So instead, they took blood. The results came back and the team came in a said “your daughter is very sick, she can’t get the procedure like this, and she’s gonna need blood transfusions. She’ll have to stay here” I had a hemoglobin of 5!!!! “where’s the blood work from here initial appointment with us !?” They asked. We told them that the doctor didn’t think it was necessary. They were shocked. Not only was I holding onto life, but I wouldn’t have had enough blood cells to carry oxygen had I been able to pee in that cup, and they put me under for the procedure. I was in the hospital for a while. Fast forwarding, UC is my diagnosis. We’ve tried prednisone, Entyvio, and now Humira. I still take both iron and mesalamine daily. But so far nothing has worked well enough. I move out for college in less than a month. I’m terrified. Anyway, “happy” anniversary to me.",2022-07-04 17:24:04

First of all, I'm sorry for what you guys and gals suffering from IBD have to endure in everyday life. It's not fun, and I feel for you, although I'm fortunate not to have anything like IBD. Although I'm lucky not to be suffering from anything like this, I'm writing here on behalf of my wife, who has Colitis and through here I understand how hard it can be living with these diseases.

My question is for those from the USA. We will be moving to the US from Europe. Obviously, in Europe, the healthcare is different; therefore, we are slightly worried about her getting the medication she needs. The cost of it etc.

So my questions are

* What does it mean for your health insurance if you have been diagnosed with IBD, or more specifically with Colitis? She's been in very stable condition for over 5 years. (no hospitalisation)
* How does it work with getting the medication? What is the cost of it? She takes Mezavant (every day) and Adalimumab (every 2-3 weeks). In Europe, she got some sponsorship for Adalimumab, so she doesn't have to pay a penny. So we are wondering how does this work in the US?

I have a minimal idea about the tiers etc., in the US, so if you could include as much detail as possible and explain things a bit more plainly, I would appreciate that a lot. Thank you!  


Edit:   
I've asked my employer and they do provide healthcare. They pay half of it and it's [https://www.aetna.com/](https://www.aetna.com/) using service this service: [https://www.justworks.com/](https://www.justworks.com/).

Also, we will be moving to NYC if that helps with any suggestions etc.",2022-07-04 12:12:12

Hello all!! M, 30 years old
30 years old

Lately my back has been in pain(I work security and right before I started working again, I’ve been feeling pain in my lower left stomach area that expanded to my back) it came after I took medication and drunk a Coca Cola behind it. I took a nap, woke up and felt pain on the left side of my abdomen. Since then it’s developed more into the pain I just described. To make things worse, I feel pins and needles pain through my different parts of my body, and a pressing feeling on my lower back. Lots of gas being let out, bloating, and the feeling of needing to use the bathroom when I don’t. 

I went to hospital and they did a CT scan. The parts of the scam that need to be noted 

>No bowel obstruction. Mild haziness near the splenic gutter and along the descending colon with particle appearance in some loops of small bowel. PERITONEUM: Small amount of pelvic fluid. No free air

>Small amount of pelvic fluid, abnormal for gender. Mild inflammatory changes related to the bowel suggestive of enteritis/colitis.


Doctor referred me to a gastroenterologist and said I may need a colonoscopy to see what’s going on(I’ve had this done before, twice actually) now I’m a bit worried, now. Any advice on what to do **from those with colitis**? Years ago in 2015 I had the issues with how my bowels moved and that’s when I did the Colonoscopy along with other tests, that came back normal.

Note: I’m not asking for a diagnosis. Just advice from those who dealt with something similar. I’ll keep everyone updated",2022-07-04 02:43:06

3363,When to see a new doctor?,__clurr,1,vs9fgq,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/vs9fgq/when_to_see_a_new_doctor/,8,"Hi everyone!

I’m trying to decide if i stick it out with my current doctor or go elsewhere. I’m not sure if I’m being ridiculous, or if this is valid reasoning to seek a new GI. I know many people have mentioned seeing multiple doctors, but I’m trying to decide if it’s too soon to see someone else. 

HERE IS THE SHORT STORY/TLDR:
Scopes from Fall of 2017 found chronic inflammation in my colon, ileitis, duodenitis, and esophagitis, and that my colon is tortuous. Most recent scopes (May 31st) found inflammation in my stomach not caused by H. Pylori. No biopsies we’re taken during the colonoscopy, and there was no mention of the tortuous colon. I did not get a lot of follow up beyond take miralax, eat more fiber, and fluid intake despite ongoing symptoms. I’m feeling dismissed by my doctor and not sure if I should stick it out or see someone else. 

Basically, I’m trying to justify seeing another doctor/getting a second opinion. When did you know it was time to switch to someone new? 

HERE IS THE VERY LONG BACKSTORY:

I’ve dealt with stomach problems my whole life - bloating, constipation, stomach cramping, etc. Most recently I have had blood in my stool and mucus, as well as urgency. I hardly ever have diarrhea, but I’ll have days where I’m going to the bathroom multiple times and I’m still not feeling empty. 

In the Fall of 2017 I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done, and I was diagnosed with GERD and candida in my esophagus, they also noticed I had a tortuous colon. I took meds for the yeast infection, and my doctor (Doctor #1) prescribed me Lynzess. I took that for about a month and stopped bc it gave me horrible diarrhea, plus I’ve never really dealt with acid reflux or heartburn. After that I didn’t really do much or seek a second opinion due to moving, getting a new job, and then Covid happened!

I saw a new GI (Doctor #2) in 2021, who requested my old scopes. Once they got them, her office called me to make an emergency appointment due to ileitis being found on the scan (Esophagitis, duodenitis, and chronic colon inflammation were found as well). I had bloodwork done to test for Celiac and Diabetes which both came back negative. Unfortunately I got Covid, so my emergency appointment was virtual and I had to hold off on any testing because of that.

This past December, I had to switch GIs because of insurance. So I saw Doctor #3 this past February. I brought in my old scopes and mentioned what was found and she recommended tests to me. I had an X-ray done on my abdomen (which actually showed I has scoliosis I didn’t know about but that’s a story for a different day LMAO), pelvic floor testing, and a SIBO test. My pelvic floor testing came back normal, and my SIBO test showed that I was slightly constipated, but no other issues. My GI doctor recommended pelvic floor therapy, but I didn’t feel it was necessary because of my test results. 

On May 31st I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done again. Inflammation was seen in my stomach, but the biopsy was negative for H. Pylori. My doctor took a biopsy on my duodenum for celiac which came back negative, but I’m not sure if it was tested for inflammation or to see if the duodenitis was still there? No biopsies were taken during the colonoscopy, but they did see I had internal hemorrhoids. There was no mention of my colon being tortuous either. Her recommendation was to wait on the biopsies, but consider the pelvic floor therapy, drink more fluids, eat a high fiber diet and due scopes for age appropriate regular screenings.

I messaged her office a few days after the scopes (June 3rd) because I was passing mostly mucus and red blood, to which I didn’t hear a response. Prior to this the blood was mixed in with my stool, so this was the first time I was actively bleeding (I’m assuming from the hemmroids). I messaged again (June 9th) because I hadn’t heard from her about the biopsy results and I had no response to my message on June 3rd. My doctor told me to take miralax, drink water, and eat a high fiber diet. She said the stomach inflammation was probably caused by acidic foods or NSAIDS (Which I haven’t taken any since April) and to monitor what I’m eating/taking.

Since then I have still been struggling with my same symptoms - urgency, blood in stool, mucus (lots of mucus), bloating, and cramping. I’m pooping every day at least once, if not more but the stool is still more hard. I’ve been tracking my food and eating high fiber, plus drinking about a gallon of water everyday and there have been no improvements. Her nurse called me last week to follow up from the scopes and to ask if I wanted a referral for pelvic floor therapy. I told her nurse that I wasn’t sure if it was necessary, and the nurse went over my pelvic floor test results and said “It’s not necessary, I’m not sure why the doctor wants to pursue this”. I filled her in on my symptoms and she got me scheduled to see my doctor on the 20th.

At this point in time, I’m not sure if it is worth it to stick with my current doctor. I’m feeling pretty dismissed and there are better hospitals with better GI departments in the area. I’m just hesitant because I’m not sure if this is me being sensitive or overthinking, or normal protocol/procedure. Getting in to see a GI is hard enough as it is, so I don’t want to have to go through the whole process of finding one again…but I’m just not sure if my current doctor is for me. I still have so many concerns about the inflammation being found and my grandma has UC, hence why I’m posting this here. I’m not great at advocating for myself but I just feel like there have been a few red flags that I can’t ignore and I want to figure out wtf is wrong with me.

Thanks for listening to my long tale and any advice related to switching doctors/advocating for yourself would be amazing!",2022-07-05 23:58:52

I'm new here but already feel relieved to find a community of people going through the same everyday struggles. I'm currently in the process of getting an official diagnosis for what all my healthcare providers think is IBD -- aka waiting for a follow up with a GI. With that being said, I can't stand the constant bloating that comes after literally everything I eat. Sometimes it gets so bad that even when I'm hungry, I refuse to eat because I know it'll get worse and cause more discomfort. I don't eat meat, use dairy alternatives, and eat fruits and vegetables, but nothing helps. I also take probiotics (once a day) and pepcid (twice a day) per my doctor's recommendations, but neither reduce the bloating. I've even tried daily exercise and digestion shots to no avail. I know I'll eventually have to get prescribed medicine, but while I wait for my appointment do you guys know any OTC meds or at-home solutions that can help?",2022-07-05 22:50:05

My colonoscopy in January didn’t show inflammation, but the biopsies did, so he said it’s some sort of colitis and put me on budesonide for 4 months (2 weeks 9mg, 2 weeks 6mg, 12 weeks 3mg). I don’t know if this means microscopic colitis or just general inflammation, he didn’t say, but either way, the meds helped at first.


When I first started the budesonide, the diarrhea was reduced from 6x a day to 2-3x a week, no more blood, reduced abdominal pain. 


But now for the past month and a half (I’m down to the last 3 weeks of budesonide currently), I’ve felt absolutely awful. Intense abdominal pain that’s sent me to the ER 4 times, reduced appetite and filling up fast, urgent diarrhea that wakes me up at night, 4-5 watery stools during the day, and I’ve lost 20lbs in 2 months. It’s actually worse than it was in the first place. The blood hasn’t come back at least. 


I’ve spoken to the GI 3 or 4 times already, and so far he has said “I don’t know what’s wrong and I don’t know how to help you, just wait it out,” so I’m curious if budesonide is something that you can “get used to” or it loses its effects.

\- The first flare-up: Had two normal bowel movements that day, then at around 6pm I started getting stomach cramps and feeling of urgency, I then had a normal bowel movement, followed by a loose stool, followed by completely liquid diarrhoea. I felt like I was going to faint (I've fainted before during a BM but several years ago) and was drenched in sweat. An hour later I went to the bathroom and when I wiped it was pink so I looked in the toilet bowel and there was red, flakey poo or mucus (not sure which) at the bottom of the toilet bowel. This then happened again an hour later and that was it. I didn't have another BM for 48 hours, and when I did that was normal. I went to the doctor after this and they think it was a bug or food poisoning, they felt my stomach and listened to it with a stethoscope and said everything was normal. 

&#x200B;

\- Second flare-up: Had three normal BMs that day, then at around 6pm I started getting stomach cramps and a feeling of urgency. Again had a normal BM followed by loose stool, followed by diarrhea. Then I had another bout of diarrhea around an hour later. This is TMI but I could see in the diarrhea that what had come out was what I had eaten for dinner approx 24 hours earlier - is that a normal gastric emptying?

&#x200B;

I can't really find any patterns to what I ate leading up to those two flare-ups. The only similar things I ate were cheese and pasta, but I've eaten them inbetween the flare-ups with no issue.

Aside from these flare-ups, my only issue with my digestive system is I have multiple BMs everyday, usually all in the morning. It's usually 3 of more BMs that are normal in size and consistency, but they get slightly looser, followed by what I think is a small amount of mucus (how can you tell the difference between mucus and poo?) I don't understand how I poo so much, it's such a large amount it seems like it's more than I even eat and it's frustrating as it impacts my day.

I’m a 25 yr old male diagnosed with Lymphocytic Colitis. I’ve had symptoms since I was about 18 and was misdiagnosed with IBS. After countless prescriptions that never worked and 4 different GI’s that all seemed to do nothing, I finally met the right GI for me (5 years after my symptoms started) that recommended I get a colonoscopy. I did and finally got the correct diagnosis! She then prescribed me a steroid called Budesonide which immediately worked but unfortunately came with some pretty bad side effects, so I stopped taking them after about 3 weeks. I then asked her what else I could take and she mentioned another prescription (I forget the name) and pepto bismol. I’ve never really been big on prescription meds so I decided to just suffer how I usually had been doing for the past 5 years. Fast forward about a year and a half and my symptoms are at an all time worst. I’m having to go to the bathroom 8-10 times a day, exhausted, cramping, feeling like a zombie, etc.

This is when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started doing endless research on natural ways to cure my disease and through lots of trial and error, I’ve finally been able to manage my symptoms. I’m now down to going just once a day with no diarrhea and no longer experience cramps, bloating, or the dreaded brain fog! Below is a list in order of what has helped me the most:

&#x200B;

1. Kefir - kefir has absolutely changed my life. I was hesitant to try it because I quit all forms of dairy years ago due to my diagnosis, but I heard it helped a lot of people with IBD so I figured fuck it it can’t get any worse. After just a small glass that I put into a smoothie with blueberries, bananas, and almond milk, I started to notice results immediately. Unlike a normal day where after I’d eat my breakfast, I’d have to go to the bathroom 15 minutes after, I never had to go at all until later that night. This was unheard of for me. After the next day of the same smoothie. I didn’t go at all until the next morning and it was fully formed!! Absolutely no diarrhea. I drink the same smoothie everyday and my horrible symptoms haven’t come back since. The key here is eating/ drinking foods with lots of pre and probiotics. I’m convinced IBD comes from an imbalance of gut bacteria and the only way to solve that is to hit it at the source by rebalancing your gut microbiota. I use the bottles that come from the grocery store in the yogurt isle but you could also make your own.
2. CBD - broad spectrum cbd has also helped me immensely with reducing inflammation and relieving my anxieties and brain fog that come with IBD. Even though I had lots of diarrhea, my least favorite part of having IBD was the dreaded brain fog. It felt like I wasn’t even alive and just moving around every day as if I were a zombie. CBD oil has helped me the most in overcoming this and now I go about my days feeling relaxed and awake. I use a brand called Mojo Wellness. They have really good peppermint oil and softgels that are easy to digest.
3. Diet - this one’s a bit obvious and I’m sure you’ve heard it a million times, but it is important. I’ve completely cut out gluten, fried food, sweets, processed foods, and all dairy other than kefir and Greek yogurt. I pretty much eat a kefir fruit smoothie in the morning, and chicken/ steak with a side of rice or fermented veggies (also packed with probiotics). I only eat foods that are easy to digest and do intermittent fasting, so I only eat twice a day in order to give my gut enough time to rest. I have my kefir smoothie around 11am - noon and eat my dinner around 6pm. It sucks not eating much but it’s worth it in the long run.
4. Supplements - I’ve tried a whole bunch of vitamins and probiotics and here are the only ones I’ve had success with: collagen, vitamin d, NOW candida support, and a probiotic called VSL #3… before I discovered kefir, I noticed that collagen would help to solidify my movements and whenever I forgot to take it, it would go back to loose. Vitamin D is good for mood and should be taken regardless. Candida overgrowth is known to be a problem with people with IBD. This again goes back to having a compromised gut microbiota. I noticed taking a candida supplement helped to lessen my movements by about 2 or 3 but they were still loose. Still a plus. I don’t take this anymore because the kefir takes care of all my problems. The VSL #3 worked to lessen my movements and solidly them somewhat, but not completely. I had to stop taking them because they’re crazy expensive. I think it’s like $80 for a months supply.
5. Exercise - this is another obvious one that you’ve probably heard a million times, but it does help. People with IBD often experience a stagnant lymphatic system, which traps inflammation in the gut. Exercising helps to relieve this inflammation because the lymphatic system is powered by musculoskeletal movement. Not to mention it’s a great stress reliever.

And that’s pretty much it! You are not alone in this battle and I hope I could’ve been of some help. By being disciplined with my diet and exercise, I’ve been able to live a normal life again. Like I said earlier I only go once a day now (solidly) and experience no cramps or brain fog. Life is beautiful and I hope this information helps.

I have UC. I've lived alone for 2 years, I'm introverted and don't socialize much, and I'd be like that even if there hadn't been a pandemic. I'm not a complete recluse--I see friends sometimes, I love going to concerts, and I enjoy an occasional night out. I always get at least a little anxious about going out anywhere due to my condition, though, and the few horrible experiences that I've had because of it. I feel much more comfortable going out when I am familiar with the area, and know where any available toilet will be.

This weekend, I'm going to be driving 5 hours by car to a different state, where I'll be participating in a recreational sports tournament with around 85 people. it's going to be about 90 degrees, and supposedly there will be ONE porta potty available, if that. I've looked at the general area of the park we'll be playing at on Maps, and I don't see any reliable bathroom options within a close range. I see this gearing up to potentially become a complete nightmare scenario for me.

I'm trying to think positively, but it's not like a concert or other event where everyone is a stranger. I know many of the people who will be attending, including numerous friendly acquaintances and somebody I have a sizable crush on. This feels very high stakes for me, and I hate to admit any kind of weakness to anybody, but I'm nervous. 

I'm even anxious about the drive down and back up (I'm carpooling with somebody I hardly know). I'm worried that I might have forgotten how to socialize from all my time alone. but above all, I'm nervous that I'll get sick and shit my pants around all these people. This feels so stupid to say, but I want to be brave and sexy and confident. I want to have a good time at this event; I want to be somebody who says yes to having fun. But I feel almost handicapped in this ridiculous, embarrassing way.

I'm not necessarily looking for advice. I'm not sure there's any advice I haven't already heard or read about. But it feels kinda good to tell people who might understand the feeling, since nobody else really can. Miiiiight delete anyway, though.


TL;DR I'm trying to be social, but being social is intimidating in general and even more so with UC.",2022-07-13 03:07:50

I've been suffering from all kinds of bowel problems for years now, matching almost every symptom I've read about colitis ulcerosa. I've seen different doctors a few times, but everytime they just tell me I have IBS, to regulate my diet and not to come back until I'm pretty much shitting blood... It has felt really embarrasing, invalidating and demotivating when trying to find a solution to this problem.

Recently I started experiencing some kind of brain fog and though it was like a symptom of covid or something, so I finally went to see a different doctor, who is amazing btw. They did some blood tests on me, and turns out my ferritin values were extremely low, along with the MCHC values. However, my hemoglobin is fine, whereas leukocyte values were abnormally high (doesn't this indicate some kind of inflammation?).

My mom has colitis ulcerosa, and I meantioned this to the doctor. He told me to go give some samples to the lab and he'll then call me with the results. The problem is, just last autumn I did this same exact thing because another doctor told me to and from the samples alone he concluded that I do NOT have UC. But guess I'll be doing it again now.

My mom (who has UC) thinks I 100% don't have it. I don't really know what to do or think if the doctor tells me I don't have UC. What then could cause all this? With the anemia and all... I feel so dumb.",2022-07-14 14:40:02

I’ve been double scoped (they found a small ulcer in my upper GI), on antibiotics, anti inflammatory medicine and nothing really seems to be helping. I’ve steadily been losing weight due to becoming afraid of eating despite being hungry because pain usually follows when I eat and ultimately when I go to the bathroom. 

My doctors don’t really seem to be listening to my complaints because nothing “that should be contributing to how I feel” is showing up. I get the craziest cramps in the lower left part of my abdomen and I always have to be close to a bathroom in case I need to puke or use the toilet.

22M

First off, I know the only way I can know for sure is going to see a GI and getting a colonoscopy. But I’m not convinced I don’t have IBD. I was told by my PCP that she didn’t think much of anything of my symptoms a few months back.

Background of symptoms:

1. Loose, flat, unformed stools. Has occurred for many years.
2. Fast digestion. If I eat corn, watermelon, leafy greens, or other identifiable food it comes out of me in 8-12 hours even if I haven’t eaten those foods in a long period of time. Maybe this is related to the above?
3. Urgency to have a BM in the morning. Comes out in seconds. 
4. Upset stomach in mornings. Usually passes after I have my BMs.
5. Pass stool on average probably 3-5 times a day. First one is always the most. 2-3 of these are typically in the first hour or two of waking up.
6. Blood when wiping for many years (5-10+ years, not completely sure). Always bright red and very small in amount. Only see it when wiping and maybe 3-5x a month on average. I have noticed that often when I have blood (maybe 60% of the time) it is a literal pain in the ass. Maybe internal and external hemorrhoids? Or maybe the constant wiping from so many BMs? I also feel like when there’s blood I have been going more times per day than when there’s not blood.

Went to the Doc about 3 months ago and PA didn’t seem concerned about those symptoms. She said if I wanted she would refer me to a specialist due to how long I have experienced symptoms but seemed indifferent on if it was necessary and said she didn’t think it was a bad idea to go but likely nothing serious if I did go. She had mentioned going many times a day can be normal and that since the blood was not black she was not personally worried. 3 months ago was the first time I discussed this with my Doc because I’m an idiot and have bad health anxiety at times and just never brought it up because if it wasn’t actively bothering me or on my mind at an appointment I never considered to bring it up. Nothing has changed since. Have been taking psyllium husk the last few days which has seemed to help the looseness and frequency to some extent but other times it seems to do nothing.

What may be going on? Does this sound like IBS, possibly with hemorrhoids? Maybe IBD? Possibly something worse? Planning to go back to the Doc soon for an annual appointment but should I not be concerned at all if the person I saw last time isn’t or should I request to be sent to a specialist?

He also did an endoscopy and noticed redness in my stomach and prescribed me PPI's which did nothing. I later tested positive for SIBO but the treatment had really no effect.

We no longer live in the same state, and haven’t for a long time. I have known for the last year or two that she’s been having some gastro issues, but I never knew the full details. Usually just explained vaguely and that she’s been having “stomach issues”. She has been seeing a GI for at least a good portion of this time.

In the last 6 months, I have gotten more information. She has MC, or at least that’s what they have told her. Some vague mention of a neurological issue driving it..but don’t have much to share there I’m afraid.

This has become top of mine because I am getting married. I want my mother to be at my wedding, and a handful of months ago she began to tell me that she didn’t think she’d be able to come. Obviously myself and my fiancé are devastated. 

I’ve done some reading. I understand it’s different for everyone. However some things she told me sent off alarm bells given what little I have read:

- doctor previously(not current dr, who she just switched to) had not stressed, or seemingly ever really addressed diet as a factor in the disease
- no food diary
- DR did have her on at least one script (not sure which one) but did apparently tell her that she couldn’t only take this medication for a couple of years before it became ineffective?

There is obviously the factor that I want her at our wedding, however - beyond that completely, I want to make sure her symptoms and condition are being managed in the best way possible.

What should I do? What can I do? 

Everything I have read indicates that diet is a hugely important piece of the puzzle, and I am frankly alarmed that in a year+ of treatment, appts, etc that it hasn’t come up. She is now with a new GI Dr (although I guess this doctor is part of the same “group” that the other was a part of…so I have doubts) and has gone to a single appointment. 

How can I help her better communicate with her doctor? What is the best way to find *other* GI doctors that she can evaluate, in parallel with her seeing this new doctor?",2022-07-18 15:59:18

I used to be healthy and go out and about. Was finally achieving stuff, but since three/four months, my life feels like it's a house of cards that is collapsing as i'm watching from the sideline.

I went to the doctor today (The Netherlands), and he made me sit down and said.. your feces test came back, your calprotectine is too high.

I scored 546.

He said you might have UC or Chrons.

He reffered me to a specialist for a definitive diagnosis, but it might take up to 4 months before having an appointment.

I called back when i got home as i was in shock and couldn't think straight. I told the doctor that 3 days prior to doing the feces test, my dentist gave antibiotics to treat an infection in my mouth

 (i had a pretty severe tooth infection that resulted in me getting a rootcanal treatment)

The dentist then prescribed the following:

Amoxicillin, 3 pills daily for 7 days.
Ibuprofen, 3 pills daily for 6 days

The doctor told me the ibuprofen and Amoxcillin could not make a false positive as they would actually lower the score of calprotectin.

I'm confused as i'm reading that NSAID's which ibuprofen is, would give higher score on the calprotectin.

Now i'm in bed. I cried and i'm still sad. I'm afraid that i'm going to lose everything that i worked for. I'm afraid that my life is going to be over, just when it started to get in the smooth sails.",2022-07-18 15:25:02

The second one I did a 72 hours prep, the tests went better. Biopsies were taken, and I was told I have Lymphocytic Colitis? 
(I was not tested for celiac during the biopsies because “I had already been tested” yet my first colonoscopy came back inconclusive because they were completely unable to take samples.)

I would except that diagnosis, however I have none of the key symptoms for LC. 
I have extreme episodes of constipation where I won’t go for weeks at a time. I have severe abdominal pain, mucus, blood, joint pain, hard and painful bloating. My BMs are hard no matter how much water or fiber I eat. I can’t seem to “empty” or feel “done” on the toilet. I’ll go 5-15 times a day trying to relieve myself of the “urge” I get to go but nothing comes out. And IF something does, it’ll be dime sized, covered in mucus and blood OR just straight clear/yellow mucus. 
I may have a diarrhea episode that seems completely out of control once every few weeks. 

I don’t think the doctor listened to me very well when I initially told him my symptoms. I mostly saw students or nurses that worked under him. I usually only sat down with him before my surgery and after to receive results. 

I’ve had an MRI that came back with “enlarged spleen”. I had no inflammation markers tested or general blood tests drawn.

She ordered an IBD antibody test which came back postive (ik this isnt a diagnostic test but she want to see if i should even consider a colonoscopy).

Ok back to present day: I called my gi to schedule a colonoscopy and they just cam back with “you dont have any of the symptoms” (which is wrong) and then they just question why my pcp even ordered the antibody test.

I’m in the UK and the NHS is in a bit of a state at the moment with waiting lists and so on. A week ago I took a fecal calprotectin test as recommended by my doctor. This was due to the following symptoms:

* light diarrhoea for around two weeks
* uncomfortable stomach 
* occasionally feeling nauseous
* chronic anal fissures 

The test came back yesterday but I was only able to speak to a receptionist who was unable to offer explanation / definition, just the results.

The bacterial test came back normal, but the calprotectin tests suggested that it was ‘slightly raised’. I have been advised to take another fecal sample test in six weeks.

My symptoms are not severe and seem to be getting mildly better, but occasionally go back to how they were before I did the test.

My questions:

* What could a ‘slightly raised’ result suggest?
* if I’ve been advised to take another test in six weeks, does this mean my doctor isn’t immediately concerned?
* can anyone offer any additional advice on how to cope with my symptoms?

I live in a high-risk area and I’m very pro-science, so I’d like to be vaccinated to be honest.

CDC: “JYNNEOS contains a live virus that does NOT replicate efficiently in human cells” and “JYNNEOS doses should be prioritized for those people who are at risk for severe disease from monkeypox (such as people with HIV or other immunocompromising conditions).”

FDA: “Immunocompromised persons, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished immune response to JYNNEOS”

And that's beside my unrelated time management issues, and the fact that the anxiety of task switching or feeling like something is taking me too long can itself sometimes trigger a bathroom run. All together, it can make me feel like there's no point trying to get things done.

Lately, I've been trying to mitigate this particular feeling of helplessness by actively using toilet time to catch up on tasks I can complete with my phone. I downloaded apps to manage my budget, study a second language, and apply for jobs.

Got a test done for IBD because I've been having pain in my lower right abdomen for a few weeks. I've actually had it mildly for about a year now, but it comes and goes, and is never very bad - maybe a 2 out of 10 - and I don't have any other symptoms associated. But the past few weeks it's been a little worse - maybe a 3 out of 10, 4 at worst. 

Haven't had any blood in stool, or any unusual amount of diarrhea. I've been a little ""loose"" in the stool lately but not to a huge degree. I've also been drinking a lot of protein shakes, which is what I attributed that to. 

Doc suggested an IBD panel and it looks like my ACCA and AMCA levels are elevated. ACCA was about 108 and AMCA was about 150. 

Can you help ease my mind at all? I can't deal with a medical diagnosis; I'm neck-deep in school right now and I want to become a doctor. I don't know much about living with IBD or if I even have it. 

Could these levels be high just from the whey protein? I understand these are antibody levels; I just got a vaccine the day before the IBD panel, could the antibodies be high just from that?",2022-07-22 21:14:47

Basically I've even medication free for the last 7 years and shown no symptoms. I hadn't had a colonscopy since I was 8 year old (25 now) but had one yesterday...

And they said that there was zero inflammation and that **""if I didn't know that you have IBD, I wouldn't have assumed you have it. This looks like a healthy colon""**

Only thing I paused at was he saw what he thinks was a small polyp but said he wasn't sure if it was, was very small. I asked him if its something to worry about but he assured me ""nothing to worry about at all"" and that if it was a polyp its benign. 

Bit of background.. I'm a 25 year old male and was diagnosed with indeterminate colitis at age 8. Although I always tell people I have crohns it's likely I had both as I had symptoms of both. Anyway it was VERY bad and I had every symptom in the book.. colonoscopy looked horrendous at the time. I then took a treatment called ""modellin"" which is a liquid powder diet and it sent me into remission. I then stayed on imuran for 10 years...

By age 18 I was only taking 5mg imuran. Not sure why but this low dose worked for me. Docs said something about the way my enzymes work (can't remember the explanation at all tbh so I might be talking shit here)

At age 18 I was weaned off and for the last 7 years I've been med free. Now it's worth noting that for the last 16 years or so I've been asymptomatic with an occasional flare during childhood. 

In the last 7 years I've had no flares. I foolishly thought ""if I'm asymptomatic, I'm fine"". Only very recently I researched IBD and realized this was a dangerous mentality. 

Hadn't had a colonscopy since I was 8 so I went in thinking I had developed cancer (worst case) or that I have mild inflammation (best case). But it turns out... I'm fine?

Now look, I'm not trying to humble brag. I KNOW that meds can prevent flares. I've read too many stories of people who went med free and had long asymptomatic periods only for crohns to violently return 

So my question is... is it possible I was misdiagnosed? Or if not, should I take meds even tho my scopes and symptoms are fine?",2022-07-22 14:11:56

very new to this sub, GI suspects it's IBD.

My initial fecal calprotectin test result was 1000+ (I don't know how high the number actually was, the test can only show results up to 1000) and since I didn't have many symptoms I was told to repeat the test in 2 to 3 weeks, which I did. **I wasn't prescribed any medication and I'm now waiting for an appointment with my GI where she will compare the tests, probably do an ultrasound and we will set a date for a colonoscopy.** 

My symptoms started a month ago, I had 2 days of diarrhea followed by 2 days of extreme stomach pain. After the 4 ""tough"" days, I have returned to my fairly normal BM schedule with no abdominal pain, most days my stool has normal consistency but it does have visible mucus + some days there are tracks of undigested food. Even when I had diarrhea I didn't have to go more than 1, maybe 2 times a day.

My new calprotectin score is **466.** 

The things I have changed in the past 3 weeks:

\- **started eating healthier** (+trying to avoid high-fiber food and raw vegetables/fruits if I can) 

\- **keeping a food diary** (for now I didn't find any triggers - e.g. I'm fine with dairy)

\- **started working out** (moderate to high-intensity gym classes, 2-3x a week)

I still had ""cheat days"" where I'd eat junk food or I'll drink alcohol, and I can't say it affected my symptoms that much: my BM's stayed the same, maybe I'd experience some light to moderate stomach pain after eating junk food or some nausea if I drank more than I usually would.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** is it possible that I have lowered my calprotectin levels from 1000+ to 466 with a ""healthier"" diet and exercise? Can calprotectin be lowered without medication when it comes to IBD? Or am I looking at something other than IBD?",2022-07-22 11:54:28

Im a 25yrs old guy from Hungary. Ive been through hell since May,2021.
Started with diarrhea, it was like water, then the strongest fatigue ever did hit me.
I spent a lot of money in fancy clinics, they found out that is my gallbladder is full of stones so I had a surgery.
After the surgery, the diarrhea and the other things didnt go away.
Everybody said I have IBS…
At this time I was depressed, like really really depressed. I had thoughts about suicide a lot, but ive tried it years before this whole fuckery and it was a fail so I think i have some things to do in this life. I was slowly got out of depression, found a new Doc and he did a lot of tests.
After ~1year Ive got the diagnosis. I have UC.
I think its absurd, but Im happy now. I can start to get back on track. I did almost gave up everything, but my family, my girlfriend and our dog are the reasons to stay here and leave this shit behind me. Got my meds, Im a new person. I love to be here, fuck ibd

I am male and 22 years old and have been perfectly healthy my entire life up until last year. In March 2021 I went to the bathroom and there was a significant amount of blood after I wiped. In the following weeks I developed abdominal pain, abdominal cramping, constipation, excessive gas, and more. I started feeling so horrible every day and it was only getting worse. 
What I think hurt any possibility of giving me a proper diagnosis was the fact that I tested positive for covid in January that year which resulted in my family and doctors believing that my symptoms were covid related. After a few blood tests came back normal I was diagnosed with long haul covid in July 2021 which I was extremely skeptical about. 
My issues persisted so I got an ultrasound, colonoscopy, endoscopy, urine test, and stool tests done. All came back normal except the colonoscopy and endoscopy which showed signs of gastritis and sigmoid colitis. 
After all this testing they kept prescribing me over the counter medications and not giving me any diagnosis I stopped going to the doctor for awhile despite feeling really sick every day. In March of this year I went to a doctor that was treating me for my “long haul covid” and he gave me an antibiotic (levofloxacin) for some urinary symptoms I was having. After taking this antibiotic I felt amazing like I had my health back but after my time on the medication was done the GI bleeding came back and i started to feel like shit again. 
Now simmer 2022 my symptoms are as bad as they’ve ever been and I’m trying to balance starting my first real job post grad and moving in with my girlfriend. I feel so horrible every second of every day that I am only able to do the bare minimum of what I’m expected to do before I need to just lay down and try to not focus on the pain and discomfort. 
I will leave a more detailed description of my symptoms below but all of my doctors have failed me and I don’t think they are even listening to me and I could use some advice from people that might have similar issues.

Symptoms: abdominal pain and cramping that seems to follow my large intestine, a constant feeling of presssure building in my rectum/colon, straining to go to the bathroom, when straining my anus swells and protrudes out, constant feeling of fullness in my rectum, tenesmus, nausea, upset stomach, lack of appetite, lower back pain, diarrhea, excessive gas, burping excessively, headaches, dizziness, burning when urinating, and an overall feeling of inflammation across my body

What makes it worse: sugar, dairy, beer, sitting for long periods of time",2022-07-23 20:18:15

I’ve been having some severe GI problems for the last 6 weeks. There’s not a moment during the day where I don’t feel like absolute shit. I’ve had bloody stools, mucousy stools, I shit 10-15x a day, severe abdominal pain and I cannot stomach eating anything. I’ve lost 10lbs in a week. These symptoms sent me to the ER TWICE in 3 days. The first ER visit, they diagnosed me with IBS and tossed Bentyl at me thinking it would solve all of my problems. Only did a urine analysis to see if I was pregnant and a blood test. Both came back normal/negative. 
The second visit sent me to the ER in an ambulance because I literally could not walk I was in so much pain. The ER attending doctor gave me a rectal exam, took more blood and more piss from me, all came back normal. They sent me home with a GI referral and I called the next day. Luckily they got me in and did a colonoscopy and found microscopic inflammation in my colon and large intestine. As I was waiting for results from the biopsies they took, I looked at my chart notes from my previous ER visit. According to them, my fecal occult blood test was normal and my stool also looked normal, so they didn’t have the fanciest idea of why I was having symptoms (basically saying I’m overreacting and I have IBS and just need to keep taking the Bentyl). My question is HOW THE EFF MY STOOL LOOKED “normal” WHEN I NEVER GAVE THEM A STOOL SAMPLE??? The doctor basically LIED, and these were the chart notes my GI had looked at before my initial appointment. I am so pissed because this is crucial information that my GI needed to know. This hindered my diagnosis big time. Eventually I was diagnosed with Lymphocytic Colitis (today). 

I work in health care and am just so discouraged by it. What if I was a patient who never was their chart notes?

I (20yo white female) was diagnosed with Lymphocytic Colitis after two years of constant hemorrhoids (grade 2 internal and external) and abdominal pain. I decided to get seen when I lost 10-15 lbs quickly without doing anything/when I got insurance. My symptoms specifically started when I became less active/life changes at 18yo. I played soccer for 15 years. When I stopped playing collegiately I developed so much fatigue, I’m so tired all the time still. My GI put me on Budesonide, which I have been taking for roughly 6 weeks. I don’t feel as if it’s working enough. I still suffer exhaustion ALL THE TIME along with the hemorrhoids/abdominal pain. To be fair it has gotten slightly better, but 50% of the days are SO unbearable and crippling sit in the shower for hours type pain. My twin was diagnosed with UC when we were 5yo and then with food allergies. So I went to an allergist and they told me I was only allergic to crab and flounder (which I never eat anyway). However, I am convinced I have food allergy too. A couple days ago I was in so much pain I sat on the shower floor for 2 hours. Should Budesonide be working by now? Should I consider deeper allergy tests?

I’m also very curious what other drug they would try? My only non-negotiable would be that I refuse to take a steroid with side effect of weight gain, which Budesonide has not given me.

Also, what are biologics? And is weight gain a side effect of it?",2022-07-24 14:53:47

A year on I've been on oral mesalamine (Pentasa) tablets. Over the past year since my diagnosis through sigmoidoscopy I feel that I'm having less well-formed stools but more 'slop' which is coming out, including more blood. 

I don't know how use use the Pentasa tablets are having (despite them having no side effects). I was also prescribed a Budesonide foam but felt that using it often made me feel anxious and uneasy (despite low systemic absorption of the steroids) so I have generally avoided using it.

I asked my gastroenterologist whether I could also use mesalamine foam as studies have shown that oral and topical in combination are notably more effective at controlling inflammation. He prescribed me a mesalamine foam, but upon trying it, it burnt so severely I couldn't keep it inside me and released it within half an hour or so.

I went back to him and told him this, and asked if he could prescribe a mesalamine suppository instead. He did so, but it seems that it's actually Prednisone, which is another steroid with even more significant systemic effects than Budesonide.

Long story short, I'm looking for some guidance from the experienced ones on this wonderful forum to get a sense of what my next steps should be. Truthfully, my condition is probably considered mild, based on the frequency of bowel movements, even though they contain blood and mucus and often not too much in the way of stools, so I don't want to be 'overmedicated'. But at the same time, reduction of inflammation is a good thing and would like to hear what people think could be a feasible next step to balance the trade-off between strength of drugs, side effects and symptom reduction.",2022-07-24 03:05:08

I mostly fear that I'll assume something is nbd but should be mentioned, because I'm simply used to feeling shitty all the time and getting brushed off by doctors. 

.....
Symptoms below if you want but not necessary to answer my question I don't think (just adding because I expect to be asked so I don't have to go back and edit)
.....

Symptoms include a historically tetchy ""sensitive"" stomach, regular (almost daily, but occasionally I get a break) loose stools and diarrhea (very very rarely do I experience constipation), gas, bloating, stomach acid issues/heartburn/indigestion, sometimes light red bleeding in stools (never black or coffee grounds looking), mucus, and sometimes it's like it's not fully digested, and generally feeling like my entire digestive system has awful road rash, nausea (though sometimes nausea means I'm hungry, but my hunger cues are effed and I don't always feel ""hungry"" just recognize I should eat because I'm cranky or nauseated - former ED in my teens which actually started because of stomach pain digestive upset at the time 😐), no weight loss (I'm fat, actually, thanks pandemic and chronic pain in my feet), fatigue (but could be existing issues, same with flaky skin bc I have psoriasis). When things are fine I can eat literally anything, spicy acidic fatty, doesn't matter. When not, it's a toss up of what will piss off my system.",2022-07-27 20:59:37

Only things that have come out abnormal are the Calprotectin test I’ve received. It was at 135 when I took it a couple months ago. Endoscopic upper GI showed nothing remarkable. Gastric emptying showed I didn’t have gastroparesis. Barium X-rays we’re unremarkable. CRP levels are normal. My white blood cells are lower than normal, specifically my lymphocytes, however everything else is within normal limits. 

Last week I had a CT scan because of the blood I’m seeing in my stool. However, it showed I didn’t have any inflammation at all. 

I’m supposed to have a colonoscopy within the next couple of months. However, my biggest fear is that if they don’t find anything, I’m still stuck with these debilitating symptoms. Is it still possible I still could have IBD?",2022-07-30 00:14:03

It’s been described as moderate to severe by doctors, and id definitely say there have been large stretches where it has been severe. After 2 years in the pandemic where I unsuccessfully trialled various medications (I’m completely immune to steroids, mercaptopurine etc) I’ve had enough. Since December I’ve been on Infliximab/Remicade. My experience with this drug has been very up and down. I’ve not had any side effects, but I wouldn’t say it’s as effective as it could be. Sure the bleeding has stopped, but I quite often still have week long flare ups and even in my ‘good weeks’ I’m back and forth on the toilet from when I wake up until the early-late afternoon. I will occasionally have the odd day where I go to the bathroom like a normal person but because that’s such a rarity I don’t trust my body and I stop myself from capitalising on those days like I could.

So really I want surgery. But because it’s perhaps not what the NHS would deem as urgent, I have no idea how long I’ll have to wait. I haven’t been able to work since I left uni so my self esteem, mental health is weakening more and more. I need this surgery because I view it as the closest thing to a cure.

Also, i have been  chalking this up to having a baby, it's natural to be tired and lose weight. I saw GI in June and they recommended a colonoscopy. Well, once again, life got hectic and I didn't have time to get the colonoscopy. 

Well, this morning, I was sitting and having my coffee when I just started bleeding everywhere. I finally told my husband that I should just get the stupid colonoscopy.

I was first diagnosed with ibs and i had a colonoscopy scheduled within 1 month, but i backed out as i was scared and FODMAP-diet worked at the time.

To start, I am a 24 year old female, who is just beginning my journey with (potential?) IBD. This is all new to me, so I'm sorry if I ramble and if my questions are stupid. I've had stomach issues my entire life, my gut has always been really sensitive and irritable. But that was never anything compared to what happened this month. On July 6, I started experiencing extreme symptoms. I was violently ill for weeks without any relief. (I am now about to share some graphic information, just a warning!) I was expelling a ton of blood, I was having nonstop diarrhea, I was fevering often, and I was in extreme pain that did not seem to ever let up. I have been sick like this for weeks now, 26 days to be exact. I went to the hospital when the symptoms first set in, was placed on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in case of infection, and of course it had no effect. I was told I wouldn't be able to see a gastorenterologist until October, but luckily, I returned to the doctor so many times begging for some help, that I got in with a GI. I met with her and she told me (and wrote on my records) that she has a ""high suspicion"" of IBD, specifically ulcerative colitis. Now, I have a colonoscopy and biopsy scheduled for this Friday, yay! 

Here's where I'm getting nervous and could use some advice/answers. Since I was sick for so long, I began to mess with my diet to see if cutting out any food groups would provide me with any relief/help me identify triggers. I seem to have found, just in the past three days, that eliminating gluten might be helpful in reducing the severity my symptoms (I have done several blood and stool samples in this process including a Celiac panel and I do not have Celiac disease, just so everyone knows!). I am still having symptoms, but they are not nearly as severe the past 72 hours. I am only going to the bathroom about 3-4 times a day (rather than the literal 25-30 I was before). What comes out of me is still a ... grotesque... consistency but there is barely any visible blood. 

I'm nervous now to get my colonoscopy. The last month has been absolute hell, I've cried so much and been in so much pain. Now that my symptoms have suddenly calmed down, I am nervous that the colonoscopy will somehow not show anything. If my symptoms are calming down, will they still be able to detect UC/Crohn's? Will the results be affected by my symptoms slowing, will they potentially not find anything? Do flare symptoms need to be present for an IBD to be officially diagnosed? 

I'm sorry if these are dumb questions, this is all very new to me. I am just desperate for treatment and a proper diagnosis so I can learn how to live my life in the future to be as comfortable and normal as possible. I am nervous about the test, if something gets missed or overlooked because my symptoms have calmed down, I'll be devastated. 

TL;DR: If i'm not having symptoms (or, specifically, *severe/flare* symptoms) can an IBD be missed or overlooked during a colonoscopy/biopsy?

Thank you everyone!",2022-08-02 00:49:45

I started having a lot of mucus in my stool a few years ago. There was no pain or blood. It seemingly went away for a few years, so I didn't think anything of it. Fast forward to about a year ago. I started getting extremely sticky stools. I would literally have to flush the toilet five times just to get it to go down. I noticed that it seemed like it had mucus in it, but couldn't quite tell because it was a solid diarrhea consistency every time I went to the bathroom. Which brings me to about a month ago. Every bowel movement that I have is now covered with large amounts of bloody mucus. There's not a lot of blood, but it's enough for me to notice. I also get slight pain in my lower left stomach from time to time. 

I went to the doctor, had an exam done, and showed her some pictures. She didn't find any hemorrhoids which concerned me since I assumed that's where the small amount of blood would be coming from. Apparently it concerned her too because I now have an ""urgent"" colonoscopy scheduled for the 11th.

Now as I'm typing this I've been for 5 days miserable dull pains almost all day small bowel movements not pencil thin but thin and when i have a bowel movement there's mucus and once in a while bright red blood and  after i go i feel burning and dull pain and i feel my heartbeat in my anus.I've changed my diet I'm literally eating rice eggs and chicken for 4 days i don't feel tired just full of anxiety and stressed out. I've been drinking peppermint tea with chamomile and it seems to help but very little i have to lay down or in a warm bath to find some relief. I'm thinking about going back to gastro to get a colonoscopy. But has anyone dealt with this before? i feel like have no closure here and i need relief .",2022-08-04 19:58:52

I went on keto and my bowel movements changed. More like constipation. But certain foods would upset my stomach like Avocados or Almonds. I went off keto a year and half ago and from there, its either very small and thin or diarrhea. Also a year ago, i got covid. Fiber helps a little but not by much. When i take my metformin, than its just diarrhea but i stopped taking that to give myself a break. My upper stomach will hurt with light touching but only when im standing. Comes and goes. Have heartburn alot and bloating. Again comes and goes. Lots of burps. My doctor referred me to the GI doctor. Hes ordered stool tests and a upper endoscopy and a gallbladder ultrasound. I am waiting on the caloprectin test. Hes thinking IBS or IBD. However my one stool test shows i have salmonella. But haven't had any symptoms of that. Besides over a month ago, when i ate one piece of raw tuna (poke). My stomach was slightly upset and i ended up having bowel movements that had orange jelly like substance for 2 weeks. But no other symptoms of salmonella. My doctor said that was from inflammation. But yet here i am, tested positive for salmonella. Makes me wonder if i have been carrying salmonella this whole time or if i do have something else going on. I have read that you can be more prone to salmonella if you have IBD or IBS. I currently take magnesium, a probiotic, and drink fiber everyday. Drink 100 oz of water a day. And nothing has changed. It smells horrible, odd looking and little mucus and almost like mushy but stretchy. Thinking that's the salmonella. Sorry if this isn't the right place to post.

Used to always eat whatever I want, in the space of about 6 months everything became an issue, and there has been little improvement over the years.

Age: early 40s

**Triggers:**

\- Alcohol causes an intense stabbing pain in lower right side, and severe, rock-hard pregnancy-sized bloating so I avoid it.

\- Grains, esp whole grains, oats, cereals (even gluten free) kale, legumes, pulses also cause severe bloating, gas for days on end.

\- Sometimes I am bent double in pure agony, sweating and wailing as my bowels cramp on the toilet for up to 1.5 hours.

\- Itchy, swollen rectum, mucus - regardless of diet.

\- Unclear whether gluten or fibre, or both are issues.

\- Alternate between loose diarrhoea and rock solid constipation, despite drinking lots of water.

\- No issues with onions, tomatoes or garlic.

\- Lactose and artificial sweeteners can sometimes be an issue.

\- I exercise for at least 45 mins every day. Don't drink or smoke or eat sweets/refined sugar.

\- all nuts seem fine, but too much peanuts gives me bad gas.

\---

**Treatment:**

Doctors dismissed me for years claiming it was stress/a non-issue, and being too fat and lazy, drinking too much alcohol. Eventually saw a specialist after colonoscopy proved very high levels of inflammation and he told me to take mesalazine for rest of my life. Also said I might have IBD *and* IBS making it nearly impossible to figure wtf I am supposed to do. He said diet was irrelevant and to drink alcohol and eat what I want (really not a good idea for me).

Last I spoke to specialist they were pushing to ""take me off their list"", saying ""you're basically fine now are you?"". Specialist recommended VSL-3 probiotics which have made no difference whatsoever. They said I could see a dietician but nothing ever came of it. They also said COVID means I am not longer a priority for them and I should take paracetamol.

Following inept advice from a doctor 3 years ago (which was later thrown out by a specialist) I embarked on a low-carb diet to reduce liver fat. I found this diet almost entirely eliminated bloating and chronic diarrhoea so I have stuck to it.

I now want to come off this low carb diet as I am concerned about long term health effects, carbon footprint and cost plus I have found that it's much harder to exercise without having eaten carbs.

**The problem I have is that insoluble fiber seems to really upset my bowels - gluten free cereal, gluten free breads, fruits, corn, buckwheat, brown rice and oats all cause severe bloating and send me to the toilet.**

**I think cellulose is my main issue. But I can't understand what foods contain it and which don't. For example, brown rice/ rice cakes is v low in fibre but seems to upset my bowels regardless.**

**How the hell am I supposed to eat a healthy diet? where can I get my carbs from? Will white flour and white rice be any better? or should I avoid those too? I just want to be healthy.**",2022-08-06 17:09:00

I haven’t until here recently been open with my condition because it hasn’t been this bad ever with the symptoms. I was diagnosed with c diff a week ago because of the UC. They have me on antibiotics.

Or what do you do when symptoms get bad and how to prepare for them. Because with the bowel incontinence I’ve debated on just wearing depends for right now until it goes away.

I have been bleeding for about two and a half years (I know I regret neglecting it, but it happened right as the pandemic ramped up and I couldn't manage to see a doctor) to the point where I became mildly anemic. Nothing horrible, I knew I'd have to get it checked out and scheduled and was looking forward to it to hopefully address it once and for all.

About two weeks ago, I started feeling weak and just generally bad. Noticed my appetite was slowly going away. My dumb ass decided to start taking iron supplements. Why, WHY did I do this without looking into it? After a couple days, my body just starts flushing everything out. It starts becoming pure blood and mucus. I became bedridden for a week, too weak to eat or drink, feeling nauseated, delirious, like I was slowly fading. It got so bad I went to the ER for fluids and they gave me a CT scan which showed inflammation in my lower left. They couldn't tell if it was from infection or a form of IBD, so they gave me antibiotics as a preventative. 

The round of antibiotics was a nightmare in and of itself. Even after I was done with them, I didn't want to eat anything, couldn't get myself to drink, and my body was absorbing no nutrients when I could get something in; it just went straight through me and out with a ton of blood. I was having horrid fever dreams and still am, as well as awful night sweats mixed with chills. I was seeing things, hearing things, and had my pulse in my head and eyes at all times. I was and still kind of am existing off of portioned hydrocodone and edibles that I can't even bear to chew. Everything tastes horrible to me and the hunger pangs are UNBEARABLE, like someone ripping a hole in my chest cavity with their bare hands. I have to force myself to eat just so I'm not in so much pain.

Today I went back into the ER because I was on the verge of fainting and my legs were hurting and cramping. My hemoglobin is still low but not low enough to have needed a blood transfusion, but my potassium was dangerously low so I got a drip IV. They tested a fecal sample and found nothing, which drives me wild. The drip definitely helped, but I'm not out of the woods yet.

I had my colonoscopy pushed up two weeks to this Monday to get this sorted, because I'm in literal misery. I'm so anxious to find out what's happening so I can hopefully fix it, but just knowing that I'll have to liquid fast tomorrow and go through with the result is worrying me so much considering I've hardly been able to sustain myself on anything for the past two weeks. It feels as though my body is trying to kill me.

A while ago, I had a medical emergency where I was suddenly passing pure, bright red blood in high amounts without a stool. I ended up being hospitalized, and they ruled out hemorrhoids. I tested negative for all viruses and bacteria (ie h pylori). I had high calprotectin — five times the normal range — so they thought maybe it was an autoimmune issue, since I have 2 other autoimmune diseases. But they did a colonoscopy about 3 weeks later and my colon looked perfectly normal. 

This emergency incident came out of nowhere, but I have noticed that I have been having digestive issues for a while. Long story short, I have days and weeks on end where I have non-urgent diarrhea about 4-6 times a day. My food is completely undigested and intact no matter WHAT I eat— fruits, veggies, even noodles.

I have also started randomly gagging and retching at random a few months ago, which has lowered my appetite. They then decided to do an endoscopy and showed me that my stomach was inflamed and red. There were also 2 dark black spots in the images but they haven’t explained that yet (my doctor is on vacation).

Any ideas of what could be going on with me? I am seeking medical help, but would like your ideas so I can advocate for myself in the doctor’s office. I am female with a baby face and many male physicians in my country do not take me seriously.

I'm almost 24, female. 

(TMI) My symptoms: main one is definitely the alternation between severe constipation and mild diarrhea (they both usually last a week or two before changing again or it's all messed up and happening at the same time), urgency, sweating, dizziness and severe cramps before/mid/after BMs, not feeling like they're emptied after, very fast digestion - in 4 hours or nothing for 2 days, occasional blood (it's been getting more frequent and in larger amounts - red water) without pain or with pain if going multiple times a day (at most 5), mucus (sometimes only that if constipated), pain in my left abdomen more or less all the time - I can always feel it if I breathe deeply and sometimes hurts to touch or spreads up to my ribs but stays on the left (I noticed that happened after eating), burning pain in my whole stomach when straining, mouth sores, eye sensitivity (pain, dry eyes and sensitive to light), stomach making lots of noises, occasional moments where my stomach burns and I'm laying on the bathroom floor nauseous, a relative (aunt) with severe Crohns.

She takes 4g pentasa daily which I haven’t seen have much effect and is due to start steroids again because of how bad it’s getting. She’s afraid of this as well as the possibility of biologicals or surgery due to acne and weight fluctuations which she’s unfortunately already experienced plenty of. (Side note is it possible for anyone that has taken steroids, biologicals or undergone surgery to educate me on how it was, the possible complications, side effects and what to look out for?)

For the past almost two years I’ve been having repeated issues with my stomach and bowels and no one can seem to give me any answers! I was pregnant for 9 months of the 2 years, so my issues were often brushed aside and blamed on the pregnancy (despite a 4 day hospitalization). 

I’ve seen 5 Doctors + emerg doctors and I’ve had loads of bloodwork and an ultrasound. Waiting for an upcoming GI scope. 

Btw, I’m 31 and female. 
So what happens is: 

I wake up with nausea and cramping pains, need to poop. I go to poop, (my BM’s go from soft to undigested to liquid, etc with no notice) and then I get extreme nausea and stomach pain (upper). No medication I’ve tried has helped me. The only thing that stops the pain is a hot shower. Aside from that, I have painful nausea that comes and goes literally all day every day. 

I thought it was CHS because I smoke pot, but I don’t vomit. 

I eat a mostly plant based diet, with a little dairy. Some junk food now and then, but generally “healthy”. 

Any insight at all would be helpful. Just looking to relate to other people who may be going through this.

1. Diet. I’ve eaten keto for 5 years and it seems almost everything about my diet needs to flip. Ie. I eat a high fiber, high protein some fatty meats, vegetable dense, diet. Until this I had not eaten potatoes, rice, or gluten in many years. From what I see gluten, lactose, high fiber foods, spicy, and many fruits and vegetables are out. What you all eat? For ref, my breakfast used to be 2 cups spinach, 5 cherry tomatoes, 2 fried eggs, cauliflower thins, and cottage cheese. This 100000% is NOT tolerated now. Without the vegetables I feel like I’m stuffed  .
2. Do you have to have repeat colonoscopy? I know my doctor could answer this, but have you had to? Is the prep always this bad if you already have constant diarrhea. I was up all night literally leaking out.
3. Cause. My doctor has stated verbally multiple times my NSAIDS use was the cause. I heavily used NSAIDS for over 15 years. Like 400-800mg every 4-6 hours for a military injury (service connected). Has anyone else had a similar NSAID use cause?
4. is a 3 month flare-up long? Or is this pretty normal? I think I have had this for a while but it was a few days and I chalked it up to I ate this, or didn’t eat this, or I had a drink, etc.

I have rubber band ligation to remove three small haemorrhoids in my rectum. It was very painful.

Then I had a defecography. And the defecography results suggests that I have pelvic floor dysfunction.

After the defecography, I lost my urge to poop.

Right now, I only have the urge to poop if I drink 1.2 litres of water ( 4 glasses of water) in the morning.

But sometimes, it doesn't work.

Normally, my stool is solid followed by soft stool.

But now, recently, I have been having mushy, soft porridge kind of stool almost everyday and I am worried.

But my bowel movement is usually 1 time each day.

Does IBD means that you must have diarrhea and have multiple bowel movements each day?

Previously, I was taking antibiotics for urinary tract infection and I think the antibiotics could have messed up my gut bacteria and this could be why I am having loose, mushy porridge kind of stool lately?

But I have already stopped taking the antibiotics. And I have take probiotics. And there is some improvements.

Sometimes my stool looks normal. But recently, it has always been more of soft, mushy, porridge kind of stool.

Is there other way of getting diagnosed of IBD besides colonoscopy? 


I have a few colonoscopy done in the past and they all turn out to be normal. 

I don't mind doing a colonoscopy again but I can't tolerate drinking the bowel preparation solution again. 

The bowel preparation solution is the worst liquid that I have to drink in my whole life and everytime I try to drink it, it makes me want to vomit. 

I just don't want to go through that again drinking the horrible, terrible bowel preparation solution. 

I have CT scan in the past. The CT scan shows that my rectum wall is thickening. 

I looked up online and some websites say that rectum wall thickening could be due to inflammation but the doctor told me that it is unlikely and it is more likely due to the fact that I have been straining when I am trying to poop. 

I have two sidmoidscophy done last year and they turned out to be normal.    

I looked up online and all the websites say that diarrhea is one of the symptoms of IBD. 

Does this mean that constipation is not a symptoms of IBD? 

Previously, I have rubber band ligation and defecography. 

I feel a lot of pain after the rubber band ligation. 

During the defecography, I feel some pain and discomfort when they insert the white barium paste into my rectum. 

I am thinking, will the pain from the rubber band ligation and defecography cause inflammation in my rectum/anus?

Sometimes, my stool looks quite normal.

Does IBD means that your stool always, always comes out as diarrhea kind-of-stool unless you take some anti-diarrhea medicine/anti-inflammatory medicine? 

I also have abdominal pain and have significant weight loss. But these could be due to other issues?

Bit of back story, i have been back and forth with the doctors for a few months now with abdominal pains, pains in the bottom left hand side of my abdomen that feels like cramps, mucus when i go the toilet and alot of diarrhea.

Ive had a Calprotectin test which came back as 702 and with my ongoing symptoms been told by my doctors all signs point towards IBD. Currently just waiting on a colonoscopy but been told i can be waiting months, and in the words of my doctor 'Might need to get used to the pain'.

I have been off work twice already this year a week at a time due to the pain ive been in with it. If i go off work again i can potentially be taken down the disciplinary route due to too many sicknesses. How do you handle potentially having a chronic illness that hasnt been diagnosed properly yet and having your work take it seriously?

Feel like im in limbo with this and that my workplace will think im taking the piss.

Any advice would be appreciated!",2022-08-16 09:36:24

I spent a lot of time in pain on the bathroom floor feeling like there was a knife inside of me, and thought that was normal (which I now know is concerning). I kept having stomach pain/IBS-D symptoms on and off most of my childhood and towards the end of college my symptoms got severe. In a month or so, I lost 10ish lbs, and had stomach trouble like every day or so. so I went to a GI doc and was diagnosed with IBS and given some pain meds which didn’t do much. so then I was slated for a calprotecin test that came back 1730 mcg/g, which we suspected was IBD, but I got a colonoscopy a week later that came back mostly normal with some very mild inflammation. so they thought it was a false positive, so we did another calprotectin test that came back ~800 mcg/g. so we did a pill endoscopy but we got similar results to the colonoscopy. obviously i was happy to not be diagnosed with IBD but it was frustrating because there was confusion about the cause. the doctor told me that it was probably an infection I was fighting off. I wasn’t taking NSAIDs because I had taken a lot in previous years for sports and had switched to only tylenol by that time. so I went to another doctor to get another opinion. she did yet another colonoscopy which was mostly normal, and then a THIRD calprotecin test which came back super normal, 31 mcg/g, and I was told it was just IBS/anxiety. by that point my symptoms had started to lessen. now, two years later, my symptoms have begun to come back. do people think going back to a GI doc is a good idea? could two really high calprotecins really have just been flukes or from some random infection? (FYI, I’ve been to endocrinologists and alt medicine docs and done food intolerance tests, which didn’t lead to anything). thanks for the help in advance! 

TLDR: IBS-D symptoms for a long time, 2 years ago had 2 high calprotecin tests (1738 and 800) but pretty normal colonoscopy/endoscopy and then normal calprotecin. now having worsening symptoms again:-(",2022-08-19 00:01:43

I've had abdominal pain for months, weird cycling between shitting 5-10 times a day to not shitting for a week, swelling in parts of my abdomen, occasional temperatures etc*


So I went to another doctor after many times trying to explain my condition to doctors and not being met with any kind of proper compassion. I have gastro appt in October.


This was the first time I had a doctor give my abdomen a feel (after seeing 3-4) and he also noticed it was swollen mostly on the left side and in the middle 3 inches down from my ribcage. He noticed lots of air inside, and inflammation around on ultrasound. CRP was low. My temp was 37.8C when he took it.


Previous history:

* Symptoms for months

* Cycle through 5-10 shits a day, to none for days. My shit will go a lovely gradient from pebbles to pebble-y sausages to normal long shites, to thin pencils, to chocolate squirt

* Last calprotectin from 1-2 months ago 470. Nothing else found. White cells in blood fine etc

* Bulging in the bottom left, and then feels rigid going up. Smaller bulge bottom right, next to belly button. It changes often

* Occasional dizziness, hot flashes

* I didn't eat in the evening yesterday, woke up being able to fart, less swelling, had diarrhea instead once 



He gave me:

- Metronidazole 400, x3 a day, 14 days

- Pantoprazol 40mg, 1-0-1 for 3 days, once a day for 10

- For pain relief: Novaminsulfon

- Worst case scenario, after antibiotics: Prednisolone 20mg, once every day for 4 days, 1/2 of that for the next 8 days after. If it helps, he said it's likely Crohn's.


I don't quite understand how he meant me to take the first two. Together? Should I just take one? Should I not? He never really explained to me and I'm very scared of making things worse.

I'm actually unsure whether I was ever tested for infections, even before this one.",2022-08-18 21:38:12

I got a local GI specialist a few months ago and she told my inflammation is mild and that I might have IBS as well. She told me she was out of treatments to try. I was asked to attend online CBT by the specialist.
I've tried all the strict diets like no dairy or gluten and those didn't help.
I asked my family doctor for anti spasmodics and those haven't helped at all. And I've tried fasting and that helps as I don't eat as much I suppose.
I'm not sure what to do. I'm struggling in all parts of my life because of this. I'm not sure if my doctor honestly has no options left, or if I should try to get into see another.

Please check your lot numbers to see if you've been affected!

If they say something like, ""oh we're so sorry that this happened, let us give you a $20 gift card as well to make it up to you"", *turn that gift card down*. 

If later on it turns out that you were affected, and you try to sue the company for medical bills and damages, the company can claim that you already reached a settlement of $20 with them and render you no longer able to sue.

I’ve had stomach issues on and off for as long back as I can remember. Full disclosure, I’m a recovering addict, so I’ve always attributed them to my use. Been on the mend for over a year and a half, but the stomach stuff continues. Months of diarrhea at a time, discomfort and bloating, light nausea, blood in the toilet but I’ve always had hemorrhoids so I never gave it much thought.

About 3 weeks ago got hit with a really bad bout with nausea, and happened to have a Dr.’s appt scheduled. Mentioned it, he poked around, thought it was a gallbladder, did a CT scan. Negative for gallbladder issues but the CT scan found “An approximately 10 cm segment of distal ileum demonstrates mild mural thickening with no other abnormality. Minimal prominence of the terminal ileum is questioned. The possibility of inflammatory bowel disease cannot be excluded.”

3 doctors said it indicates Crohn’s, but a couple blood tests and stool tests showed nothing. IgG & IgA are around 10-15 respectively, no antibodies in the Flexitest 2, no parasites, no infections, bacteria, or food poisoning, and my Calprotectin is < 5 mcg/g which completely deads the idea of Crohn’s to my understanding.

As these weeks go by, my days are filled with extreme nausea (I never vomit, not with this, or typically any other vomit-y illness), constipation, thin stools, loss of appetite, cramping, bloating, random shooting/stabbing pain in lower stomach, heartburn, weakness, lightheadedness, and fatigue to the max. No new meds, no environmental issues, but TONS of stress (new job, going back to school, wife is 37 weeks pregnant, and on), and I feel absolutely debilitated, and getting worse.

I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy scheduled for Thursday but honestly, I’m not hopeful. This will be my 3rd in 10 years, and the last 2 have gone nowhere. I’m just at my wits end. Could this just be IBS? It just feels like… more than that? Idk, this might not even belong in this sub so I’m sorry if it doesn’t fit, but I’m so out of my element with this and don’t know where to go, and I’m just really struggling. The not knowing is killing me. 

If anyone has insight, guidance, whatever, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.",2022-08-22 04:01:42

Read some things that made me worry so I came for some help.
A couple of years ago I had bowel inflammation. My gastroenterologist did a colonoscopy, and told me that it is a small inflammation and that it is neither CD nor UC. My fecal calprotectin was never over 150 at that time. I was prescribed mesalazine.
After my calprotectin dropped and my gastroenterologist saw no more inflammation with colonoscopy, I was told to stop taking medications.
Maybe one mistake I made was never pausing mesalazine before doing FC tests.

One and a half later, I started getting some diarrheas, but nothing serious (first time I felt a lot worse). I decided to do fecal calprotectin and candida in stool tests.
Turns out my fecal calprotectin is over 1000, and my candida is 180 colonies(I had high number of colonies before too). I scheduled an appointment with the same gastroenterologist (it will happen next week because there are huge waiting times). I have started taking mesalazine, nystatin, and probiotics on my own, and I feel good now.
Recently I started reading more about FC. Is it possible that I had UC or CD, the whole time? And is it true that even if I don't have symptoms now, I can expect heavy symptoms in the following months (I read that high FC also predicts future relapses)? Any advice?",2022-08-26 23:51:05

Thankfully because of my symptoms (will go over shortly) I wasn’t really eating much in the days prior so once it came down to the liquid diet 1 day before procedure it wasn’t that difficult. I had heard the prep was nasty, and working in a medical field myself constantly having to call to replace the kits for patients because they couldn’t handle it, I should’ve expected this but I didn’t. They tell you to keep it chilled because it’s better. It’s not. I read on here someone said to mix crystal light, I tried that thankfully only in a cup and it went from disgusting cold sem*n flavor to a SOUR thick cold sem*n flavor. I tried chasing it with apple juice and would immediately puke. I honestly was chasing the bowel prep with VINEGAR. it would completely erase the taste immediately. And technically doesn’t it fall under the “clear liquid diet” 🤣😩 so I will admit I couldn’t finish the prep. I wanted so hard to find someone tell me they didn’t and they were able to get a colonoscopy but I couldn’t. I want to be that for someone else. Eat very little in the days following, follow the liquid diet, and try your very best to drink as much as possible until your bowels go from brown, to liquidy brown, to a very yellow/clear with small dark particles, to a yellow pissy with particles that are smaller and lighter, to an almost completely clear bowel. If you are still cloudy, drink some more prep. Again, I finished half and had a small diet in days leading up and was having clear bowels. It’s again RECOMMENDED to FINISH YOUR PREP so I don’t want you to read this and give up but read this and know if you absolutely can not because it’s so gross you’re vomiting that if you’re liquid, clear and can “see a penny at the bottom of the toilet” you’re good to go. Now for my symptoms. They are truly all over. I will have bloody diarrhea to no stools and constipation. Complete abdominal pain, sometimes in lower left quad. Sometimes upper right. Extreme acid reflux. Heartburn. Can not eat without being bloated. Sometimes I have rashes and then flares. Most of my flares of bleeding stools are always around my period. I could keep going but I won’t. I have had x rays, ultrasounds, INTERNAL ultrasounds, blood tests, poop tests and now I am on the colonoscopy and endoscopy. Still no real diagnosis yet but they did take biopsy’s so I am hoping for some answer so I can finally feel better.",2022-08-26 17:35:37

Hello all - Have been diagnosed with Crohn’s 3 months ago. Lost 20 lbs, was anemic, had a flare during diagnosis GI started me on Prednisone for 8 weeks and Entyvio infusions every 4 weeks after initial dosing.

Now I am off prednisone and 5th Entyvio infusion but still EGR and Calprotectin levels are at 34 and 750 range. During flare they were at 50 and 4k range. 

I have gained 12 lbs weight in the last 3 months, no diarrhea and no stomach pain but lab levels are not coming down.

GI says I have active inflammation but symptoms are in control. I don’t have antibodies for Entyvio but level seems slowly increasing still at 12 after 4 infusions. 

GI is saying we may switch to Remicade after next infusion if still bio markers EGR and Calprotectin are high. She is saying Entyvio may not be drug.

Really appreciate the genuine challenge each and every one of you face and the community we have here to share and help. Please share your thoughts. I like the safety profile of Entyvio but wondering should I switch or give it more time. GI is giving the choice to me - so getting some perspectives. Thanks!",2022-08-30 05:27:54

I got pregnant in 2019 and UC onset early in pregnancy. I was diagnosed pretty quickly- had elevated CRP, elevated calprotectin, and flex sig/biopsies confirmed UC. I was prescribed mesalamine but turns out I am allergic so I stopped taking and just tried to make it through my pregnancy. After I delivered baby, UC symptoms virtually disappeared. At around 4m postpartum I started to get excruciating pain in both of my knees, hands, and sometimes elbows.  By the time I got referred to a rheumatologist, I was pregnant with (surprise) baby #2 but was told my joint issues were definitely being cause by the UC. My joint pain was actually better during my pregnancy. UC symptoms came back and was diagnosed again by a different GI doc with same findings of chronic UC (I’m in the military so always having new docs). Delivered baby and within 3 days of delivery I stopped have bloody and mucousy stools/urgency. But then my joint pain returned and is now the worst in my hands and elbows, and sometimes my knees. I started Remicade right after delivering baby in March of this year, so I’ve been on it for ~5 months. It has done nothing to improve my joint pain. Every morning I wake up, my hands are quite literally locked closed (or open and hard to close). Since remicade isn’t working myrheum gave me a small dose of prednisone. Only on day 3 but that’s not helping either. How is it that I can have such bad joint pain and not even be having UC flares? Shouldn’t they go hand in hand? My rheumatoid factor test a long time ago was negative so that’s ruled out. Lupus ruled out by blood work. Im being told if these steroids don’t work it may be fibromyalgia, but I don’t feel like that’s what I have just from reading about it. I’m soooo lost and confused and hate not having answers. Has anyone been through something similar? Or any thoughts or insight?

I quit birth control but the symptoms never went away. My stool became a lot softer, before that I mostly suffered from constipation. 
Once a week or so, I started having diarrhea and severe pain in my abdomen.

I went to doctors and did all sorts of tests. Last year I did a colonoscopy with biopsy and it came back fine. They didn’t find any inflammation. Calprotectin is normal. KT showed one diverticula in the sigmoid colon but it wasn’t  inflamed. 

I went to GI multiple times and tried all sorts of treatments. The thing that helps me the best is sulfasalazine, which is used to treat ulcerative colitis. All my symptoms go away after I start taking it.

Last time I went to GI she told me that I had to take sulfasalazine for one more month and then I had to learn to live without it. She thinks my IBS might have caused some inflammation in the sigmoid part of the colon. I stopped taking sulfasalazine about a week ago. Yesterday, I started having liquid diarrhoea and constant pain in my lower abdomen, especially to the left. I also have some pelvic pain. My colon just feels sore if that makes sense.

The diagnosis doctors give me is IBS and after treating me for a bit with no results they usually give up and don’t know what to do.
Could it be IBD, since drugs against inflammation help?

29F. Normal BMI. UK

I’ve been in pretty constant pain for 4 weeks and starting to feel pretty anxious/scared. I’m not sure now if this is gallbladder related like I initially thought or not but would be really grateful if people had similar symptoms could let me know - especially now I’ve had some blood specks in my poo (ew sorry.)

Ok trying to summarise as clearly as I can (sorry if it’s a bit long):

- I’ve had shoulder pain in my right shoulder for years, since university could never figure out what was causing it did X-rays etc. my osteopath a couple of years ago suggested I get my gallbladder scanned incase that was causing pain. 

- ultrasound showed 6mm polyp, surgery was offered but I didn’t take it as I thought I could manage with diet. I also keep getting told that polyps can’t cause pain.

- shoulder pain has been getting worse and having more regular flare ups for the past 6 months (used to be twice a year but got 4-5 bad flares in my shoulder in the last 6 months.

- can feel if I eat something spicy or fatty, wouldn’t call it pain just more a dull ache under right ribs.

- ultrasound again 3 months ago as I wanted to check if the polyp had grown or if there were stones. This was clear other than the polyp I already knew about. 

- my tummy hadn’t been feeling right for a few months but couldn’t put my finger on what it was. 
- then 4 weeks ago I woke up at like 1am after an hour of sleep in agony. Extreme stabbing pain under my right rib, couldn’t get stand up. When I did stand up I kept throwing up. 

- went to a&e they did a CT, bloods and urine. She thought I might have kidney stones but I didn’t. They said they couldn’t see stones on the CT for my gallbladder either and sent me home saying it was a fluke and would go away. 

- it didn’t go away 😂 spent two weeks not really being able to eat anything and constant stabbing under right rib. Sometimes the pain would go down to my tummy but always felt like it radiates from that rub. And the actual “stab” pain comes from right rib. 

- booked a consultation with a gallbladder surgeon/specialist but it was a bit of a wait

- two weeks after the first a&e trip I had an “attack” again, half an hour of not being able to move (I hadn’t eaten anything yet it was the morning) went back to a&e as I didn’t know what to do - no gp appointments available. 

- the doctor thought it was gallbladder but as I have the consultant booked she said to wait and go to him. 

- spoke to him, he wanted an MRI to happen that week (that was last week it’s private) there was a delay so it’s now happening next week. To show gallbladder/pancreas/liver. I don’t see him again for 2 weeks though.

- then yesterday and the day before I noticed I started to have bright red blood specks (I’m not sure how else to describe them) in my poo. Not on it or when I wipe but flakes through out - sorry gross. 

- went to a&e again as I couldn’t get hold of the specialist and was quite panicked - again no gp appointments for 6 weeks. 

- the doctor in a&e was great but didn’t know what to do. He started asking more bowel questions and said he thinks this is bowel like IBD or something. 
- I know have a colonoscopy booked in for 2 weeks time with the original gallbladder surgeon. 

I haven’t been getting diarrhoea but I did get it one day when I tried to eat kale. Like went straight through me dark green and I was in pain for the rest of the day. 

My right rib also feels tender to lie on my right side.

I am very scared and worried.

Does having IBD means that eventually, you will need surgery?

So about 3-4 months ago I started noticing blood and mucus in my stool(its mixed with the stool and not separated most of the times, sometimes there’s blood and clots and the wipe) and after a month I called my doctor and got a blood and stool sample done. The blood sample was fine however the stool sample had 447 for calprotectin which is considered high! My doctor said that the chances that I have Ibd are high and he booked an appointment with a specialist for me(Its in 2 months and potentially colonoscopy). Now im just really paranoid about having ibd and lowkey scared. I never have trouble passing stool, rarely diarrhea if any. I barely feel any belly discomfort and even if I do they are really mild. I go to the bathroom from anywhere between twice a day to 4-5 times a week. I feel no pain and never really nauseous.

I started having stomach issues when I was in college. It didn’t start off as anything crazy. I remember my freshmen year getting food poisoning. Then 6 months later I was diagnosed with mono, traveled to a foreign country, and got food poisoning there. After that trip specifically, my stomach issues got worse. I was getting “food poisoning” (or at least what I thought was food poisoning) so often. By my senior year of college, I had food poisoning three times and two times within the summer. I can’t really prove it but I have a really strong feeling it’s not food poisoning. 

The last time I had this “food poisoning” reaction, I’m still recovering from and it’s been 4 weeks. The first day, I threw up a few times and had really bad abdominal pain for the next couple of days. The diarrhea was so bad that just water was coming out. Usually when I would have food poisoning, I was pretty normal within a couple of days but this time I never went back to normal. Instead, I just feel terrible but in different ways every week. I took Imodium after two days to see if it would help and it made the diarrhea a little more solid for one or two bowel movements but now, it still falls apart in the toilet. Initially, it felt like I had burning diarrhea. Like it burned me inside when I had to go. I started taking Florastor and that seemed to take the burning sensation away but not the diarrhea. I had a lot of mucus in my stool that went away after a couple of days. A few times I think I saw blood in my stool. It wasn’t a lot but I saw a streak there. I went on the FODMAP diet for a few weeks but found no improvement in cutting out lactose or gluten (or anything else) from my diet (I was negative for celiac). After I noticed Florastor wasn’t making more of an improvement, I switched to a new probiotic (Renew Life 30 billion) but I’ve only been taking it for a couple of days now so we’ll see if that helps. I haven’t had abdominal pain recently but I have those sudden cramps and sudden urges to go. I went 4 times within the span of 1.5/2 hours this morning. Now I’m starting to see bits of food in my stool (eggs, string beans, fruit, etc.). I’ve been feeling really fatigued, I sleep 10 hours a night and still feel exhausted. I feel so dehydrated from all the diarrhea. I think I lost 3-4 pounds.

I know a lot of you are probably going to say “go to a doctor” which is valid advice. I’ve been to a few GI doctors who have said it’s “just IBS which is a good thing because it could be worse!!” which doesn’t feel great especially since I’ve been feeling terrible lately. I’m trying to set up appointments with better doctors but most of them are booked out until January 2023. I read up online but the internet is confusing as hell. I’m scheduled for a colonoscopy and endoscopy in 2 months. Until then, I just want to hear from people who may have experienced similar issues.

I’m not asking for a diagnosis but has anyone been through something similar who has been diagnosed with IBD? I noticed I lost some weight but is weight loss more rapid for people with IBD? Any advice (literally anything) would be much appreciated. I’m so desperate to figure this out and feel better.

EDIT: I just read through some of my stool tests and I see that my doctor checked my calprotectin levels which was <16 (or not of concern). I read that there’s a pretty good chance that if you have IBD, you have high calprotectin levels but is this always true?",2022-09-04 21:48:53

I start taking my dulcolax and peglyte within the next few hours. I know it’s kind of lame, but I was crying last night at the thought of having IBD. This colonoscopy has unfortunately been needed for several years, but I continued to write off my symptoms as “not a big deal” and avoiding telling doctors the truth about my pain 😔. 

I guess I’m just anxious/upset/worried because I’ve spent the last year being screened for numerous autoimmune diseases and I think I knew deep down that I probably didn’t have those diseases, so I just wasn’t that worried, you know? The thought of a colonoscopy terrifies me… not because of the procedure, but because of the outcome. It will confirm or deny my dark bloody stools, my extreme fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea etc. 

Admittedly, I spent hours on the IBS thread trying to find someone with the dark bloody stool issue that I have, and well, I couldn’t really find anyone 😔. I have a fear of the medication even though I know it makes a world of difference for people. I’m just afraid. One part of me is like, maybe IBS would be better, even though the treatments available aren’t great..but then it wouldn’t explain everything else? I don’t know what to think. 


I’m sorry for the long rant… I’ve just been an emotional roller coaster the last day and I’m afraid and need some reassurance😔. Admittedly I kept fighting off the urge to cancel my scope (like I did months ago). I know I need it though, without it I’ll never get answers.

Is your bowel prep in powder, liquid or tablet form?

They all taste horrible. My last few attempts have been unsuccessful and I just vomit everything out.

I am thinking of the liquid or tablets form but I don't know if it is available for me.

The hospital that I go to only used the powder form. But I don't think that I can endure or tolerate drinking the powder bowel prep again. My body just couldn't take it.

There is a private clinic that offers the liquid form.

It is called Fleet phospho-soda.

But I heard that the liquid form, fleet phospho-soda can cause serious side effects such as damage to the kidneys.

I am at a loss of what to do.

I can't drink the powder (Fortrans) bowel prep.

My wife [30] has an autoimmune disorder called Ulcerative Colitis. She has had her UC diagnosis for about 5 years now. 

Her first flare up was awful and landed her in the hospital 2 weeks before our wedding. 

We are both healthcare professionals who like to do a bunch of research before we make decisions, including checking out all of the options for her treatment. She has tried a couple pharmaceuticals but the biggest thing that has helped her has been marijuana. [Disclaimer- we live in a place where it is legal!]

 Seriously- marijuana has been a life saver for her! It has prevented any more flares, and she can enjoy life without being impacted by her disorder for the most part.  No more bloody stools, having to randomly rush to the bathroom, or being unable to tolerate any foods other than rice and veggies.

We were blown away by the results and I am so thankful that she found something that has worked wonders for her! [Not trying to persuade anyone to try this or advertise this, just being upfront about our journey over the past 5 years.]


I know  this might be super triggering to some, so I made this account solely to humbly seek guidance with our current issue. 

We really need some help with people who may have some experience dealing with something similar.

We found out 3 weeks ago that we are pregnant with our first! [Currently 6 weeks along]. My wife stopped using marijuana for her UC the second she found out.

Fast forward 3 weeks, and she has felt horrible. Not the typical expected nausea/morning sickness from pregnancy.

 She says she is worried a flare is coming, and even had some symptoms [bloody stool] this morning for the first time in 4 years since using marijuana for her UC.

She is devastated, and does not know what to do.

 Does she go through the flare and risk ending up miserable and bleeding out in the hospital again while losing out on vital nutrients for the developing baby?

Does she go on more pharmaceuticals which can negatively impact the growing baby?

Does she have some rescue marijuana to prevent the flare which does not have a lot of data/research done for us to make a quick and easy decision?

I know you can't give medical advice but I am curious if anyone maybe has some similar experience or can help us.

We are trying to weigh the pros and cons of all options, with mama's health and baby's development as our top priorities.
 
Feel free to DM me or reply here.

I’m F25. 
I’ve had IBS for some time it was triggered because in 2017 I got CDiff and it completely ruined my toilet habits. It took a long time for my body to heal but for the past 2 years i’ve come to a place where i felt i was okay and i was comfortable with my bowel movements. 

End of July I started getting extremely soft stools accompanied by bright pink mucus. It hasn’t stopped since. 

The stools aren’t like diarrhea loose but looser than what I usually do and brighter in colour. Some days I feel like I have to go but all that would come out is mucus. Other days i’m fine and I could not have to poop for two or three days at a time but then when i do - i’m going all day. On days like that I do get cramping but I don’t have any other symptoms besides bloody mucus and very on and off toilet habits. I was tested for various infections and parasites - all negative. I’m going to my doctor today to discuss what comes next and i’m going to push for a colonoscopy. 

It all just came on suddenly in one day then never stopped. It’s kind of keeping me up at night. I haven’t noticed my diet helping or making it worse either.

We are a team of biomedical engineers at Georgia Tech working with Emory to mitigate patient discomfort with colonoscopy prep. Oftentimes, as I'm sure many of you know, patients find it difficult to consume prep due to poor taste and immense volume. However, when patients don't prep correctly (about 20-30% of the time), this can lead to bowel impaction or improper flushing of the colon to conduct the procedure. Many patients have their procedures rescheduled or even canceled after all that prepping, which is a frustrating experience.

We are trying to gain user insights about the colonoscopy prep process through 30-minute virtual interviews or written responses (both anonymous and the method of communication is up to you). For anyone who can tell us their story, it would be greatly appreciated.

Please pm if you are available to speak with us, we really care about this issue and hope to progress healthcare in the small ways we can. Thanks so much!",2022-09-15 01:09:06

I've also had severe abdominal pain to go along with it. On Wednesday I began vomiting uncontrollably- throwing up bile and continuing to retch after nothing was coming up. I visited the ER because of this and was given some fluids and jello, and had a CT scan of my intestines. They found my entire colon was inflamed, and the doctor said I have ""pancolitis"". I was negative for all infections in my stool test but had a WBC of 20k.

I was discharged with some lomotil, pain meds (tylenol w/ codeine), and ondansetron to control the vomiting in the meantime. Yesterday I had my first visit with the GI doctor and he said he thinks I could have IBD, so I have my first colonoscopy ever scheduled for Monday.

My questions are:

Has anyone ever experienced similar symptoms and been diagnosed with IBD? I am unsure if my high WBC could be caused by that, but if any of you have experienced similar please let me know. (:

Could IBD symptoms show up so suddenly? I have never had bowel issues before this and I was actually a pretty regular, consistent pooper. I also have no family history of IBD (though my mother has IBS).

Do you guys have any advice to prepare for the colonoscopy? I'm still in a lot of pain and having the severe diarrhea, so I'm worried the laxatives could potentially make it worse and I was wondering if there is anything I could do to make the experience easier.


I'll gladly accept any other advice as well while I wait for the Monday colonoscopy. I'm just curious about what I asked and since you guys have the most experience (and I might be joining yall soon), I was hoping you could help. Thank you!

Edit: Please don't DM me asking me about your own symptoms. Idk why I even have to say this

Update: I had to be hospitalized because of severe abdominal pain and after the colonoscopy I am staying in here for a few days. The doctor said ulcerative colitis after looking into my colon and taking a biopsy of my stomach because of vomiting. I'm on steroids to get it under control and he's discussed putting me on Entyvio for the future. Thank you guys!",2022-09-16 13:23:41

&#x200B;

we are a team of german medical students trying to build a companion app to manage and treat CEDs. Our academic affiliation is complicated since we all come from different places and have met through the [healthcare hackathon in Mainz](https://www.healthcare-hackathon.info/). None of us are paid for any research, nor are we officially affiliated with any research institution.

We are aware that there are plenty of apps around, but none of them so far are cooperating with Physicians and offer actual, substantial changes to the medical care you receive.

We'd love to create a system that empowers you to see a doctor quicker when you need to, but also to be able to skip on routine-doctor visits (every 3 months in germany) if they are not needed.

&#x200B;

Since we want an app that fits to your life best, we figured we'd ask you for input and ideas on how we could improve your situation in particular. Are there special symptoms you perceive before you need a change in medication? Do you wish you'd be able to contact a health professional faster? More knowhow on which foods seem to trigger you?

&#x200B;

Any idea you have, we're glad to hear about it.",2022-09-16 08:29:59

When I flare, I follow a strict AIP diet and use medication. I did this protocol recently and pushed my UC back into remission, so thats great. However, I was at a bachelor party a month ago and broke the diet by eating a ton of pizza, which I never normally do. Honestly think it had been years since I last had pizza. Ever since then, I’ve actually remained in remission, but now I get gassy and have subtle nausea about 60-90 minutes after eating. Usually it lingers and fades away. Despite having UC for years, I’m almost never gassy or nauseous after eating, which is why I stick to the diet. 

I’ve experimented with what I’m eating, dialing down histamines, watching fodmaps, nightshades, fatty meats, etc. and I can’t seem to find a super solid pattern to make sense of it. It seems to be worse after dinner. Just wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone here and what you did about it.

3834,CTE scan (intussusception results and some questions),ittollsforthee1231,3,xighnx,IBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/xighnx/cte_scan_intussusception_results_and_some/,1,"*I'm posting here 1) for anyone who ends up scouring Reddit after being diagnosed with an intussusception and 2) to ask a few questions about the rest of my scan results and next steps (if there are any worth pursuing). Also posted on* r/CrohnsDisease.

A CT scan last month revealed a 2.5 cm small bowel to small bowel intussusception (I posted more about this earlier for those interested in more details). My GI told me at the time that, although it was not likely the cause of my issues, it could develop very serious complications and would almost certainly require surgery. She referred me for colorectal surgery and told me it was very rare for them the resolve on their own. When I met with the surgeon, he acted like I was wasting his time by showing up there--to the point where I had to say directly, ""My doctor sent me here--I didn't ask to be referred"" (It's not entirely related, but the surgeon even made weird comments like ""well, if you want me to take out any organs I guess I can do that but I don't think that will help."" To which I was like...no, I was just told I needed to see you. Please stop offering to take out my organs for funzies...

The surgeon told me I almost certainly didn't have a \*real\* intussusception. He said it was likely physiological/transient and that my GI was probably just...ignorant (same hospital system--I still can't believe one doctor would say that about another doctor to a patient but whatever). I had CTE scan today that showed no sign of the previously noted intussusception and said it was most likely a **""transient paristalsis-related artifact""** (if anyone knows more about what this means, I'd appreciate hearing from you!).  

I've been pursuing answers for my chronic right quadrant pain, issues with diarrhea and constipation, and recurring joint pain/mouth sores. A recent colonoscopy showed diverticulosis and microscopic colitis. In addition to the absence of the intussusception, the scan showed:

* **mild increased mucosal enhancement of the sigmoid colon** 
* **minimal descending and sigmoid diverticulosis**
* **trace free fluid within the pelvis which may be physiologic**
* **wall thickening of the urinary bladder**

I guess my real question is, does anyone see anything here that resonates with their experiences? So far, in addition to this scan I've had:

* a colonoscopy (positive for diverticulosis and microscopic colitis)
* abdominal ultrasound (negative)
* CT (intussusception, since resolved; thick-walled, irregular bladder)
* Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (flagged by the system for high chloride, but my doctor said this is insignificant)

My doctors seem satisfied with these results and uninterested in pursuing additional testing, even though they don't seem to think these fully explain my symptoms. A big part of my worry here is that, in 2020, this same pain became incredibly severe and had me in and out of the ER. It somehow eased up for most of the following year, except for MAJOR issues with constipation and diarrhea. This year, though, the pain is steadily increasing and I'm very worried about it getting really bad again. But my doctors have got me feeling more than a little ridiculous for continuing to seek testing/imaging of any kind. And, frankly, I'm starting to feel like it would be better to let things get really bad again so that I'd at least be taken seriously. 

I guess my main questions are:

* I've seen information about a correlation between transient intussusception and IBD. Has anyone experienced transient intussusception as an indicator of your condition?
* Does any of this resonate with you in terms of your experiences? Do you see any clues or similarities in your own diagnostic journey that might be of help?
* If you were in this position, would you take any additional steps to ensure you've got as much information as possible? Or does this all sound like a reasonable end of the road for me? I've asked about a capsule endoscopy several times, but every doctor here has told me that they are used only for bleeding/anemia issues.

Recently I also had a pilonidal cyst develop and burst on its own. I went to a colorectal surgeon to get it looked at…he proscribed antibiotics and said to keep an eye on it. 

Maybe related to these problems, for the last several years at seemingly random intervals I get flare ups, in the form of feeling an extreme itchy sensation in my anus. There’s sometimes also pus discharge from above that area.
At the same time as the anal itching, I experience very bad nausea and fatigue.

This can flare up suddenly out of nowhere. Sometimes it can be when I’m on a hike or something active. It’s very odd that the anal itching seems somehow connected with the feelings in my stomach.

She asked for all the standard stuff to confirm an IBD, like calprotectin, CPR, VHS, all came back elevated. But she also asked tests for all types of hepatitis, plus HIV and syphilis. I never had that asked before, and googling it didn't give much of an answer, so my question is: is there any correlation with IBD at all, do they behave the same way? Is this some new protocol I'm not familiar with? 

She did mention wanting to start budesonide, but since it's such an expensive treatment in my country, she wanted to get a second opinion. Could it be because of the imune suppression aspect of budesonide, so it's best to rule out any underlying conditions that could be made worse? I wouldn't think 8 weeks of it had that much effect on the immune system like that..

L-cysteines impressive detoxifying effects are due to the amino acids role, as the rate limiting enzyme, for the bodies master antioxidant - Glutathione.                                            Commonly found in your local grocery or pharmacy vitamin aisle, N- Acetylcysteine is also used as a first line treatment for acetaminophen (Tylenol) poisoning in emergency rooms and is extremely safe. I've only taken NAC for two days, but can personally attest to actually feeling pulled out of this never ending flare.

""A common feature of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is a  depletion of endogenous oxidant defenses such as ascorbate, β-carotene,  α-tocopherol and glutathione\[[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710726/#B12),[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710726/#B13)\].  This last compound is a naturally occurring tripeptide (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly)  found in high concentrations within tissues. In experimental acute  colitis, cellular glutathione levels decreased significantly and **the  administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) restored  glutathione level and decreased colonic inflammation""**

Methods: ""Thirty seven patients with mild to moderate UC were randomized to  receive a four-wk course of oral mesalamine (2.4 g/d) plus  N-acetyl-L-cysteine (0.8 g/d) (group A) or mesalamine plus placebo  (group B).""

Results: ""**Clinical responses were 66% (group A)** ***vs*** **44% (group B) after 4 wk of treatment** (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 0.64 to 9.65; *P*  = 0.11; NNT = 4.5). Clinical improvement in group A correlated with a  decrease of IL-8 and MCP-1. Rates of adverse events did not differ  significantly between both groups.

Discussion: ""Mucosal biopsies taken from active gut inflammation sites from UC  patients produced significantly more reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and superoxide) compared to either uninvolved or healthy tissue\[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710726/#B10),[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710726/#B19)\]. Glutathione and glutathione peroxidase are the most important system for elimination of H2O2. Consequently, the reduced glutathione levels in the inflamed mucosa from patients with UC could be decreased\[[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710726/#B12),[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710726/#B13)\].  The oral treatment with NAC (a precursor of glutathione) of UC patients  could restore the circulating and local levels of reduced glutathione  to respond to the excess of reactive oxygen species.

“These are fragments of colonic mucosa showing mild congestion of the lamina
propria along with slight increase in the inflammatory cells content with
negligible active inflammation. However, there is evidence of focal gland
disarray/loss in some of the fragments along with mucin depletion and surface
epithelial attenuation in places. No cryptitis, crypt abscesses, granuloma or
fissuring ulcerations are seen. This glandular disarray/loss is not
characterising but a possibility of late consequence of post-infectious/active
colitis (as documented clinically) is less likely. Moreover, this site specific
mucosal changes occasionally seen in the rectum, cannot be appreciated in this
random colonic biopsy sample. A remote possibility of chronic inflammatory bowel
disease therefore, cannot be entirely excluded. If clinically appropriate,
multiple site biopsy followup is highly recommended to confidently exclude an
inflammatory bowel disease.

There is no evidence of microscopic colitis, dysplasia or neoplasia.

My problems really started taking off in high school though, around 2002 (20 years ago. God, I'm old).

In 2014, my first gastro doc did a colonoscopy and an abdominal CT scan that came back good. A year later, he did a small bowel follow through X-ray where I swallowed barium which also looked normal. Any time I would bring up IBD to him after that, he would tell me it generally doesn't go into remission on it's own (I had an extended period of feeling normal for about a year but that's the longest I've gone).

I wanted a second opinion so started going to a new gastro doc and she is great, but I haven't redone any tests yet. Just given her my symptoms and access to my old test results. She also isn't convinced it's anything beyond IBS D, other than BAM, but I didn't respond to the medicine for that.

I also had a fluke infection with blastomycosis in 2018 that had me in the hospital for a couple weeks and resulted in a back surgery. They did a lot of scans that month. 

One of the reasons I'm so concerned is because I get frequent mouth sores and ever since the infection in 2018 I have been experiencing joint pain in fingers, toes, and knees that comes off and on. I have had multiple negative celiac blood panels and even saw a rheumatologist that did a ton of blood work that was all normal.

I have two primary concerns right now.
One is that I have some type of small intestinal crohn's that has been missed. Two is that regardless of what this is, nothing I have tried has given me control over my symptoms. 

All I can do at this point is ask her to repeat tests, but I don't want to do them again if they aren't necessary. Any tips of advice here?",2022-09-23 21:31:40

The device has apparently been able to put some patients into complete med-free remission.  

This sparked some further research on my part, how could I join one of these studies?  So far I've found that I don't qualify, but I also [found](https://www.jove.com/t/58984/laboratory-administration-transcutaneous-auricular-vagus-nerve) that it may be possible to try essentially the same/similar treatment on my own by using a TENS machine to stimulate the vagus nerve via the ear.  This is called transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS).

Interested to get other's thoughts on this.  I have been doing this for a few weeks using the methods in the linked Jove article above but haven't seen improvement yet beyond what could simply be placebo.

I still have none but I felt bad enough that I started seeing a new doc that has done a whole new work up on me. Blood work shows very insufficient in vitamin D, and slightly raised levels of inflammation. Given vitamin D supplement. Colonoscopy showed ZERO signs of inflammation in my colon, but biopsies show active and chronic inflammation in a very small part of small intestine… so maybe Crohns? MRI a month later (and after finishing my bottle of vitamin d prescription) shows no active inflammation anywhere but slightly thickened walls where chronic inflammation was found.

How did it work for you?  And what did you have to go through before you were offered it as a treatment?

It took 17 years of progressively worse symptoms to get taken seriously enough to have the workup that got me the diagnosis of collagenous colitis.

Budesonide resolved most of the pain and brought the calprotectin levels down, but didn't really improve the diarrhoea - and after three months pretty much stopped working.

Mesalamine did nothing but make my hair fall out.  Azathioprine - even the small dose I was placed on - made me violently ill, then LFTs four weeks into treatment came back sky high.  So that one's out.

I'm getting ready to make a follow-up appointment with the GI, and I'm not at all interested in trying any other outmoded poisons like mercaptopurine or methotrexate that would be just as likely to damage my liver as the azathioprine.  He flatly refuses to prescribe a biologic as, in his words, ""that's only for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's"".  (Besides, most biologics aren't exactly easy on the liver, either.)

Meanwhile, I'm all but housebound:  with as many as a dozen liquid stools (occasionally more) in a 24-hour period - and that's if I limit my intake to one meal a day.  Dietary measures do nothing to control it, short of not eating at all.  Loperamide stopped working years ago; cholestyramine whacked out my thyroid (plus, it didn't work, either).  I'm exhausted and cold all the time, and I'm just sick of it.

I've been researching surgical intervention for refractory collagenous colitis, and it appears that temporary ileostomy has been shown to provide histologic remission in some patients.  I don't think I can face being stuck in my house for the rest of my life, so I'm curious to know if anyone here has gone through this type of treatment - and how did you convince your doc to go forward with it?

*NB:*  Much as I'd like to, changing docs is pretty much not an option.  This issue has all but bankrupted me, so I'm now on Medicaid; there are only two GI groups in town that accept Medicaid patients, and I've already been seen at the other one - they were even worse.  Short of some heretofore-unknown wealthy relative leaving me sufficient funds to afford better coverage or even paying out of pocket entirely to go elsewhere, this is what I'm stuck with.",2022-09-26 23:45:30

She is a brilliant student and she got diagnosed with crohn's while she was doing her master's. And she actually survived all the medical tests, procedures and her uni's exams while being severely anemic.  She did her robotics master's at nantes university, nantes, France. Her master's final grade isn't very good because she got hospitalised during that time. But she has a good profile. 

She's in remission now. But she doesn't have it in her anymore and my parents are looking for a guy to marry her off. She doesn't want her world to revolve around her husband. 

Please help me find some countries for my sister to go to for work or do a one year masters or diploma and find a job? She wants to do a PhD. But it'll take some time to get there I guess.

I'm sorry if this isnt the place to rant about this but, I've got a feeling that I can't shake that I have Crohn's or something similar. Anyways.

I've had GERD since I was a kid, took meds for a year and felt fine so was taken off. Fast forward to when I was active navy, and I got hella sick after my last deployment, and haven't been the same since.

Dry heaving, constant nausea, lightheadedness, fatigue, abdominal pain, very loose stool with mucus 9/10 times, the 1/10 is typically constipation for a couple days then right back to the ""normal"" loose mucusy stool. Feelings are not typically relieved by passing gas or bowel movements, tho sometimes they're relieved only a little bit and make it more bearable I guess.

Had a colonoscopy/endoscopy at the same time by the navy. Doc said everything was ""normal"", however the packet he gave me said everything but my stomach was inflamed, hemmhoroids, and a nodule in my esophagus. Countless CT scans of my abdomen, countless ER visits both military and civilian.

I've had a shitload of blood drawn, checked thyroid levels: normal, and many metabolic panels. Docs all brush it off as IBS and send me on my way, but I'm literally doubled over in pain every day and feel like I'm one foot in the grave.

Medically retired 3 years ago on grounds of ""panic disorder"", GERD and IBS.

New family doc did a blood draw last year for an IBD panel. Had a couple things flagged on that. Referred to GI in town, who told me the navy did a proper ""extensive"" workup on me and they're gonna corroborate my IBS diagnosis.. still taking amitriptyline and famotidine for my GERD. More bearable day to day but still feel like shit overall. Still have loose mucus stools.
