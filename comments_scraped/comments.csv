2,t3_k4x6p1,cheetoPalmer,2,gebfaos,CrohnsDisease,"When I’m in the thick of it, the only thing I’ve found that helped was a hot bath. If you have epsom salt, you can add that. After the bath use a heating pad if you have one. 

As far as your diet goes, I would focus on fluids for now. If you’re have 4-8 BM’s/day you’re chances of getting dehydrated are high. If you’re craving solids, maybe try foods you would turn to if you had a cold. Soups, crackers, bananas etc. 

It sucks and sometimes nothing helps but those really terrible moments don’t last forever. 

If you feel like you can’t take it anymore and you continue passing bloody diarrhea as well as vomiting then I would recommend visiting the emergency room. If they draw your blood, ask them to look at your white blood cell count. Elevated WBC’s can be a sign of inflammation which might encourage your doctors to take a deeper look.",2020-12-02 01:23:34

You get good nutrition without consuming fiber and foods that create inflammation. I find that this helps me get into ketosis very easily and I can add electrolytes, like magnesium and potassium. If you want specific brands let me know via PM. I use [iherb.com](https://iherb.com) as they have free shipping.",2020-12-02 17:34:45

But if that doesn't work, I don't know if you're in a state that either allows recreational use, or if you use recreationally anyways, marijuana basically took all my pain away when I had strictures and also made food look somewhat appetizing.

I've used these hospitals for most of my other tests and appointments. There are also some nearby towns with hospitals/infusion centers where I wouldn't have a problem because it's a 30 minute commute which is fine. 

Nope, I have to go to this place an hour and a half away for some reason. It turns what should be an easy thing that I knock out by mid-morning into something that I have to sacrifice a whole day for.",2020-12-01 23:29:33
12,t3_k4vim5,tobemantobedobedo,3,gebn0d6,CrohnsDisease,"tell me about it!
I’m not from the US and this year happen to be the year I moved to US, found out I gave crohns and i’m trying to get my head rapped up around this insurance thing! 

I have no idea how American people put up with this. I have been so lucky to have lived in countries than don’t nor have all this drama. I find that i’m sick, tired, in pain and to have to do all the calls on top of dealing with my job and just daily life is so hard.

On the other hand, this country has some of the top treatment options and as long as we have insurance we have access to it. So that has to be appreciated because in many countries and esp with covid, treatment is not made available- not research, not trial, no nothing and people are left with basic treatment options that are of course free, but what’s the use?",2020-12-02 02:35:05
13,t3_k4vim5,EratosvOnKrete,2,gec2s4s,CrohnsDisease,"why? bc health insurers and pharma bought off congress and any attempt to change to single payer [which is **not** government control of healthcare] is said to be socialist.

anyway, if you can change to cimzia or stelara you give yourself injections. no need to worry about hospital visits",2020-12-02 05:03:42
14,t3_k4vim5,forbin0227,1,gelh9g2,CrohnsDisease,"Insurance here is such a scam. My piece of shit insurance has denied my wife Humira and Entyvio twice now, even though her GI is saying nothing else has worked for her. Completely taking covid out of the picture, life since June has been pretty tough. Shes been in an almost constant state of flare up since June with no end in sight. The 6MP and budesonide shes taking is doing nothing for her Crohns except giving her a laundry list of side effects (or just exasperated Crohns symptoms.) She was on Remicade as a teenager and she was in remission for years after being on it, idk why they ever had her stop it. We've been together for 10 years, and we've been searching for the right doctor/medication combination for 9 of those years. And now that it seems like we've finally found a doctor that will get her on biologics, insurance wont fucking giver her the medicine her doctors are saying she needs. Because her doctors took her off the cheaper medicines last time because she was getting sicker. Its just so fucked up shes being forced to take medicine her doctors are saying will not work for her simply because theres a miniscule chance they can save a couple bucks. And she suffers every single day. And as a result, my kids and I get so much less time with my ""real"" wife because shes so sick. Now add in the panic that Indiana hospitals are filling up because us Hoosiers seem to be the fucking brightest bunch of idiots on the planet and cant wear a fucking mask. Im not worried about covid as much as Im worried about her needing hospitalized because of her worsening Crohns and us getting turned away. Okay i have to end this rant at some point lol. So sorry your getting screwed by insurance as well. I think a lot of us are. Medicare for all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2020-12-04 15:10:03
15,t3_k4t4xh,TopScallion,2,geandqj,CrohnsDisease,I had to submit a form to HR along with a note from my doctor. What line of work are you in?,2020-12-01 21:31:07
16,t3_k4t4xh,TheOrderOfWhiteLotus,2,gec9um8,CrohnsDisease,I had one last year that just ended. I didn’t really ask for it but I went ahead and filed it and ended up using it a few times so it’s definitely helpful. You just tell HR you’re activating it.

17,t3_k4rodi,Moxi_Floxi,2,gebl1p9,CrohnsDisease,"""Rule out Crohn's colitis"" in a note like that usually means that Crohn's colitis needs to be ruled out (*not* that he has ruled it out). I don't know what your IBD history is but, if I had to take a guess, it would be that you've had only small bowel/terminal ileum Crohn's in the past and now your GI doc is wondering if it's in the colon, too.

It's also possible he did in fact mean that he saw no evidence of Crohn's in the colon and therefore he ruled out that region as being involved (you still have Crohn's, though, just not in your colon -- sorry). It's hard to know with just that one sentence to go off of. But this is less likely IMO as usually different language is used for that in a note (e.g. ""no endoscopic disease in colon"").

Do you happen to know where your Crohn's was when you were diagnosed/if your disease was just limited to the terminal ileum in the past?",2020-12-02 02:16:46
